{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.","response":"DM: Yep, the barbarian for his first and only time so far managed to avert battle through a social encounter and rolled pretty damn well on a persuasion check. So you got one. You get one. You got your one. Never again."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Next time he dies.","response":"DM: Yeah. Essentially. Which managed to not turn it into complete bloodshed. You continued on your way to Kraghammer, presented your paperwork, were given entry into the city and that is where we begin this adventure."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.\nSAM: In the city of Kraghammer?","response":"DM: In the city of Kraghammer."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wow! This is fantastic.\nTRAVIS: We're in, right?\nMARISHA: Yes. We were at the door. We were talking to someone right?","response":"DM: Yeah, you were talking to the front guards at the gate of Kraghammer. They have begrudgingly let you inside. Giving you a couple of pointers little prods and sent you into the city proper. You made your way through the darkened alleyways and stone carved tunnel that leads into the main, central portion of the city proper. An enormous underground metropolis sprawls out before you. The dark earth and shadows creating beautiful stone work, marble columns, archways, and labyrinthine bridges climbing across the vertical cityscape. All warmed with the red glow of some strange, crimson rock peppered throughout the town as a light source. A large metal forge envelops the center of this cylindrical city. The entire is a three-tiered cylindrical city that is built into the ground of the mountain itself. Welcome to Kraghammer!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Remind us. Did we bullshit our way in here, or did–\nLAURA: No, we had a way in.","response":"DM: No, Allura got your paperwork so you were actually able to get in this time."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But, Ashley speaks Dwarvish. Pike speaks–","response":"DM: Pike speaks Dwarvish and she's not here."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I speak Dwarvish as well!\nLAURA: Oh good!\nORION: I do.\nSAM: That's fantastic.","response":"DM: The only other bit of information you have about the whereabouts of her is that she came here to go into the mine Apparently, a mithral mine where this evil is supposedly brewing. You heard that the one person who owns the biggest part of the mithral market here cornering, his name was the dwarven Lord Nostoc Greyspine. That was the only name you had in regards to this deep earth quarry."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Greyspine?","response":"DM: Greyspine, correct."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We have to go find him, don't we?\nTALIESIN: I think before we do anything we should find a place to sleep.\nORION: That's true!\nTRAVIS: Oh! We're all jacked up from before, right?\nTALIESIN: Wouldn't it be nice to put everything down for a little while.\nSAM: Of course. I've got a lot of booty that I need to stow.\nORION: Good way to phrase that, Scanlan. Also, I would like to check out any places where they might have enchanted libraries or what not.\nSAM: Can you stick with us? You're the only one that speaks Dwarvish.\nLIAM: Yes, you're getting ahead of yourself.\nORION: I'm just saying put it on the list.\nLIAM: Let's look around. Are there any dwarves in the vicinity?","response":"DM: Oh, there are many! As you finish this conversation you look about there are two guards posted nearby wearing dark crimson and brass chest plates that have a uniform scar carved across the front. It's actually built into the armor itself as a design. They're both staring awkwardly at all of you arguing in the middle of this entry thoroughfare of Kraghammer."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Tiberius, make with the dwarf-talk, please.\nORION: Hello, friends. My associates and I were looking for a place of lodging for the night and a place of reputable reputation.","response":"DM: One dwarf shouts over to another one, “You hear that, Jepson?! They're looking for a place to “stay.” “Aye, I heard that right. It's about time we had some new folk in town. Well, if you're 'looking for a place to stay' I'd say your best bet would be the Pig Pits.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is that the name of a place?","response":"DM: “Yes! Certainly! The Pig Pits.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Those are actually pig pits, isn't it?\nMARISHA: I feel like we're being hazed.","response":"DM: “What?! No! Not at all.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That sounds fine with me.\nLIAM: This is Common?","response":"DM: This is all in Common, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Which way to the Pig Pits, sir?","response":"DM: “Pig Pits are that way.” He points over the edge and you see down past the central forge structure in the city to the very bottom nearby a large temple that envelops the bottom floor of Kraghammer proper there is indeed a distant slop of mud where internal livestock are being kept."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I bring out a piece of gold. Please, sir, we're looking for a place to stay that isn't covered in mud.\nLAURA: Thank you, sir.","response":"DM: “No worries.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I like your armor by the way.","response":"DM: “Well, thank you kindly.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Was that a wink?\nLAURA: It was.\nLIAM: That's all she does.\nLAURA: That's all I do is wink at people.\nLIAM: It's a nervous tic, really.\nSAM: Smells in here.\nTRAVIS: Drinking territory.\nTRAVIS: Yes!","response":"DM: There are tables, most of them in decent condition, some of them half-broken and repaired, probably from some previous encounter in the bar. In the center of the room, there looks to be a not currently in use, specifically built brawling circle. It's about 30 feet by 20 feet. It's more of an oval. It's not in use, currently."}
{"prompt":"SAM: An octagon?","response":"DM: Essentially."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How high is the ceiling here? Can Grog fit in here?\nTRAVIS: Oh right, am I like–?\nTRAVIS: What're you looking at?","response":"DM: “It's not very often we get someone with that kind of a mug on you. Let me buy you a drink, come \"sit down!”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: My kind of people, see you later! I go grab the drink with the lovely dwarves.\nLAURA: We grab a table next to the dwarves with Grog.","response":"DM: Both tables next to the table they're at are completely filled with dwarves."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I take a sack of gold out of my own pocket, slam it down on the table–\nLAURA: A sack of gold, are you crazy?!\nLIAM: Gentlemens and ladies. Ladies and gentlemen, we are traveling from far away. We just arrived from Emon. We are fascinated to see your underground city and to celebrate the occasion I would like to buy every dwarf in here a round. Bartender!\nLIAM: Let it rain!\nMARISHA: Make it rain.\nTRAVIS: I would like a cask of ale.\nLIAM: I'll need your largest bowl of ale for this one here.\nTRAVIS: Cask. Cask of ale. Cask.","response":"DM: “No worries, Adra's got your back, be right back.” She wanders off to the back room, comes back and starts pouring stein after stein after stein of ale."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah. Keep going. Looks good.","response":"DM: You do notice she is definitely the head of this tavern and all of her barkeeps are male and seem to be worked rather ragged."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What was her name?\nSAM: Excuse me, miss. You.","response":"DM: “Adra. Yeah?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm sorry?","response":"DM: “Adra.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Adra! You run a fantastic establishment.","response":"DM: “That's right I do!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thank you for welcoming us and allowing us to buy this round.","response":"DM: “Of course. Patrons that come and drop coin like that are welcome any time.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, thank you for your hospitality. Might we inquire about staying here the night? Do you have an inn with the establishment?","response":"DM: She reaches below and pulls out a big tome and starts thumbing through it. “You know, \"actually we have openings right now on the second floor.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Several rooms, or just one?","response":"DM: “Do you need them side by side?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: That would be nice.","response":"DM: “We could pull him there and push him into room seven.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Something with a little bed for me.","response":"DM: “Giles!” One of the dwarf barmaiders comes over. “Aye?” “Get Stepheson out of his room, move him to the third floor. We have to open a block for our new guests.” “Ugh, fine.” The older dwarf stumbles his way up the stairs begrudgingly. “Right, so I can get a room for each of you. We're looking at eight rooms separately, that will run you per evening about 25 gold pieces. Does that sound about right?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Total?","response":"DM: “25 total pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, okay.\nLAURA: You want to share a room?\nMARISHA: Yeah! We'll bunk up.\nSAM: Grog, you and me. I can sleep on your feet.\nLAURA: Probably like 15 gold then for just that amount.\nSAM: We're penny pinchers.","response":"DM: “How long do you expect to stay?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: At least a few days.\nSAM: I'd say a week.\nTALIESIN: With an indefinite hold, we have business in the city.","response":"DM: “Right! Well how bout we pay the week in advance and I'll give you a discount?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What's the discount?\nMARISHA: Wait. I thought we were going to be heading south?","response":"DM: “Let's say, 100 gold for the week, all five rooms.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're pretty flush, I think we can handle it.\nLAURA: Yes. That works.\nTALIESIN: This doesn't terrify me.\nLAURA: I think I did the math wrong.\nTRAVIS: I was told there would be no math.\nSAM: Sounds good!\nLAURA: Gah! I hate not having a calculator! Fine!","response":"DM: “Ah! Great!” She pulls back and pulls some keys out and hands them to the rest of you. Hands you some paperwork, shows you which rooms are yours and says, “You're welcome to stay all you like, ask questions, hang about. Just make sure you don't do anything stupid near the Carvers.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ooh! Like what? I do things like that all the time!\nLIAM: Sorry. Our Dwarvish is a little thick. Near the–?","response":"DM: “The Carvers, the Carvers!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The carvas. Of course.","response":"DM: “The Carvers!”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: The Converse! Of course!\nSAM: The Car Verse?","response":"DM: “Is this your first time in Kraghammer?”"}
{"prompt":"ALL: Yes!","response":"DM: “The Carvers are the guard that run this city. They're the ones that keep the law.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The scar!","response":"DM: “Yes, the armor, the Carvers!”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, what is with the scar? I've got one myself.","response":"DM: She leans back and as you reveal the rather gnarled scar on your chest. She reels back a bit and two of the nearby dwarves go, “Yeah!” They chug down their drinks."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah! More drinking!\nTALIESIN: That shouldn't be a problem. Mostly we are looking for Lord Greyspine, if I recall. We have business with him.\nLAURA: We might have business with you, if you've seen a halfling come through.","response":"DM: She thinks to herself and goes, “There was a halfling woman, but she was staying at the \"Firebrook Inn.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The Firebrook.","response":"DM: “The bottom floor, for a couple of weeks. There was talk about her. She got in a few fights herself. The one with the silver armor? That one? Yeah, she was a firebrand if ever I saw one. Right up my alley, I like that one.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How long ago would you say this was?","response":"DM: “Oh, she went through a few weeks. I haven't seen her recently.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Thank you. Perfect.\nTRAVIS: Is there a champion of the circle of fighting in the tavern? Is there a reigning–\nSAM: Already, Grog?!\nTRAVIS: Well, I have to know these things!\nTALIESIN: He has to do something.","response":"DM: She turns the barrel that she has on the table towards you a little bit and you can see the actual symbol, this burned image on the side that says, “Balgus Brewery.” She goes, “That'll be Balgus. The one that supplies us with what you're drinking. He's the undefeated champion. But I don't think he's quite right to fight at the moment.” She points towards the very edge of the bar and you see one older grizzled dwarf, long gray hair pulled into straight braids in the back, big bushy beard that's all shoved up into his face because he's asleep, drunk as a skunk, on the edge of the bar."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Another time.\nLIAM: Save it for a rainy day.\nTRAVIS: Does it rain down here?\nTALIESIN: I don't think they have rainy days.","response":"DM: “You said Greyspine?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, Greyspine.\nTALIESIN: We are looking to set up a meeting.","response":"DM: “Which Greyspine?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Nostoc?","response":"DM: “Nostoc Greyspine. He's definitely a business type one.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well who's the friendlier Greypsine?","response":"DM: “The friendlier of the types would probably be the head of House Greyspine.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, how many Greyspines are there?","response":"DM: “Oh, well there's probably several at this point, I've lost track. The family line's been going for a while. However, of House Greyspine currently, Ironkeeper Gradim Greyspine is the head of this entire city. Voted in ten years ago, actually. He's head of the council.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ironkeeper what?","response":"DM: “Ironkeeper Gradim Greypsine. Gradim! You're– (sigh) These commoners. Learn to speak the language!”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I understood!\nLIAM: Adra, may I ask, obviously we have no dwarves in our little party.","response":"DM: “Unfortunately.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Unfortunately for us.\nLIAM: Sorry, about that. You're very welcoming. We appreciate that. How welcoming would you say the city is to outsiders? Would we stick out like a sore thumb?","response":"DM: “Probably. As long as you don't do anything stupid. As long as you keep the coin flowing, and as long as you stay to the upper levels. The lower levels you get to more of the business: the miners, the forges, the foundries. When you get to the business areas, that's where the guard gets heavier and that's where folks don't like you poking near their money.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: So the lower levels would have the mithral mines?","response":"DM: “The mithral mine, aye.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: There's one?","response":"DM: “There is one now. It's all been, and has been for quite some time, completely helmed up and run by House Greypsine. The Keystone Quarry is what you're looking for.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're not really interested in that. We just want to see the city. Our business is elsewhere.","response":"DM: “Yeah, I would not recommend it. Not without proper business credentials on that. You'll end up being questioned very heavily.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sounds like a dirty business, anyway.\nLAURA: Right.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, you want to stay away from those miners Scanlan, that's a dirty business.","response":"DM: She gives you a look almost like it was a slightly racist statement, but then passes it off because you paid her a lot of coin today."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So racist.\nLAURA: So No-stock. Nostoc?\nLIAM: Nostoc.\nLAURA: Nostoc Greyspine.","response":"DM: “Yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You said that he's kind of a–?","response":"DM: “Oh, there's a reason he's the one put in charge of the mines and the businesses and the foundries.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh. Where is he located, exactly?","response":"DM: “Well, if he's not home at the actual Greyspine Manor– which is a sprawling house. It contains all the ones who live there.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We're going there!","response":"DM: “He's probably down at the actual–” What is it? Pardon. Bear with me. Consult my notes! “He's probably down by the Greyspine quarry itself, keeping an eye on the business there.” There's a nearby dwarf having a few drinks, goes, “Ah, Greyspine, there's been troubles round there! Apparently, a friend of mine works there. Got a big, nasty scar last week. Wouldn't even pay him for his time off to heal. It's bullshit!” He slams his drink down on the table."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Down at the quarry?","response":"DM: “Aye.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How did your friend get this nasty cut?","response":"DM: “He works there! Said there was things pouring out of the caves. Goblins and the like!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA and SAM: Goblins?","response":"DM: “Ah, goblins are nothing.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course not.","response":"DM: “Seems there's something other than goblins poking out through this hole. Just saying, that business is in for a serious problem if it doesn't change.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does your friend ever have drinks here? “No. He's been sober for two years. We're not friends anymore.” Tugs on his beard a little bit.\nMARISHA: Oh. I'm sorry. I think.\nSAM: A lot to process.","response":"DM: He pours another drink. At which point, Adra slaps his hand and says, “Pay that. He bought one round!” He finishes his drink and walks away."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Excuse me, one thing, Adra, are there any mystics in this particular town that study any arcane arts?","response":"DM: “Of course! What, you think dwarves are just the baseline folks who brawl each other?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So many racist comments. Jeez!","response":"DM: “What you're looking for is House Thunderbrand. They are the ones who, by blood, have the arcane arts in their family line.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Interesting.","response":"DM: “They run most of the enchantment process in the city, they also train– they call it train– some of us call it more 'indoctrination.' But, they're definitely the focus of all arcane arts here in Kraghammer.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Thank you.\nSAM: Thank you for your time, Adra. Carry on with your evening. We'll seek you out if we have any more questions.\nMARISHA: Oh, that's– we did promise that.\nLIAM: Enjoy, gentlemen! And lady.\nLAURA: What time of day is it?","response":"DM: Best that you can tell, inside– you can't. You just arrived, probably around 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, so you're probably pushing sunset right about now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do dwarves carry the same schedule?\nMARISHA: I don't know.\nLAURA: Does anyone know?\nTALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.","response":"DM: Make an intelligence check!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh! Roll it! You're the first one.\nLIAM: First die rolling. Nice!\nLAURA: 18, plus, what is that? Investigation? Or insight?","response":"DM: This would be a straight intelligence roll on this one, so your general knowledge of dwarves."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh. 20, then.","response":"DM: 20. That's not too bad! In your experience, you know dwarves, depending on their lifestyle and what they do for a living, their clocks can run differently, but for the most part, they run in tandem with most other races just because it makes it easier for dealing with outside forces. But, like I said, it's very variable. There is no set, locked time of: this is morning, this is evening, they just sleep when they need to and wake up when they need to."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's like living in Alaska.\nLAURA: Right!\nMATT and MARISHA: Dwarven Alaska.\nSAM: Yes, fellows, what should we do?\nLAURA: Check out the Firebrook Inn, yes. That was where Lady Kima was staying. Also, I think somebody should run reconnaissance on Greyspine Manor.\nTRAVIS: Like stealth, you mean?\nLIAM: Yes. I don't think we should try to go directly to the mines and find Nostoc.\nLAURA: No.\nSAM: Agreed.\nLIAM: No, I think maybe we should enlist the help of a dwarf here in the city to introduce us to Nostoc. I mean, we're not trying to raise hell, or bring down a thousand dwarves upon us.\nTALIESIN: There's no sense attempting to be subtle.\nSAM: Although, that does sound fun.\nTALIESIN: Everyone's going to know that we're here, and what we're looking for by morning.\nTRAVIS: Why don't we get old Drunky Greybeard that's got his face down on the bar to do it?\nLAURA: Yeah, but he's very– Well, let's ask him. Maybe he's drunk enough to help us. Saddle up, Grog!\nTRAVIS: Me?\nLAURA: People seem to like you here.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm really– oh, that's true.\nLIAM: You're the connoisseur.\nTRAVIS: Maybe I'll part my armor, so he can see the scar. Post up on the bar.\nMARISHA: Take him a drink!\nLAURA: Yes, take him a drink. A very large drink.\nTRAVIS: I would like to get the largest goblet you have of ale, and I would like to go over to, what was his name? Bulbous?","response":"DM: Balgus."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Balgus.\nTRAVIS: I had it right.","response":"DM: Close."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Balgus. I would like to–\nSAM: I'm coming with Grog.\nTRAVIS: Yes. I would like to go up and put my scar, and post up on the bar and (throat clearing)","response":"DM: (snores)"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (louder throat clearing)\nSAM: I take out my flute and I play a little Healing Words spell and try to heal him of his drunkenness.\nLAURA: Just a little of his drunkenness, not all of his drunkenness.\nTRAVIS: He likes him drunk, so maybe like, half.\nSAM: Huh, I don't know where that was coming from.\nTRAVIS: I'm sorry to disturb you, your name is of great repute around these parts.","response":"DM: He wipes a globule of drool that's crusted into his beard. “Aye, you've bothered me nap. What do you want from Balgus?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We were wondering if we might, perchance, acquire your knowledge about town, for a bit of a search.\nLAURA: (whispered) Talk to him about fighting first.\nTRAVIS: Right, I hear you're a good fighter. You look strong.","response":"DM: “I've heard the same.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right. How often do you get challengers in this tavern?","response":"DM: “Not as often as I get woken up from my sleep. Which is never. Because only stupid people do that.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lost cause. Abandon ship!\nTRAVIS: Right. I have an intelligence of six, I know what I'm doing.\nLAURA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: There is a very pretty lady over there, with slightly pointy ears. (whispering) I'm\ntalking about you or you. (normal volume) There's two of them! They were actually wanting to ask you\na question if you wouldn't mind.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Me?!\nSAM: Why is he doing this?\nLAURA: Why would you throw this to us?\nMARISHA: I know!\nTRAVIS: Because I was either going to fight him or I was going to throw boobs at him, and I went with boobs.\nMARISHA: He realized he was sinking.","response":"DM: That's level ten you get that, by the way. Throw Boobs."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Persuasion. Oh! Good roll.\nTRAVIS: Look at that: one. 19!\nLAURA: Woo!","response":"DM: 19? He takes a moment, and grabs the drink that you prepared from his hand and goes (gulps)."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Nice form.","response":"DM: “You've got five minutes.” Then he stretches his back a bit. This gnarled hunch that he holds in his physical posture, flexes it a bit, and now you can see the rippling muscles that show beneath his tunic. This is a built dwarf. You don't know what past he's had, moving boulders or forging crazy iron shit, but there's a reason this guy has a reputation. He stands up off of his stool, which you can now hear crack with the weight of a dwarf, which are made for normal dwarves. This guy is solid muscle. He saunters over, looks about for a second, almost like he's looking for his next target. Sees the pointy ears, sees the pointy ears, and goes (sighs) and saunters up to the table, slams his hand down."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Why is he coming towards us?\nTRAVIS: Because I told him to. Because you're supposed to ask him–\nSAM: Boobs!\nLIAM: Steady as she goes, ladies.","response":"DM: He sits down."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (whispered to Laura) You're better at this than I am.","response":"DM: “You called for Balgus, why?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Hello, Balgus.\nMARISHA: Hi, Balgus.\nLAURA: We just heard you're so impressive and masculine.\nMARISHA: Yes!\nLAURA: We really wanted to talk to you.\nORION: I use my Earring of Whisper to Vex. Cool it down.\nLAURA: Oh sh– okay.\nORION: Calm down. Not so sexy.\nMARISHA: I reach out and I stroke his bicep because I can't hear that.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Keyleth, stop doing that.\nLIAM: I disagree, heat it up.\nLAURA: Roll so good.\nMARISHA: I'm really low in charisma. I'm really awkward. Persuasion.","response":"DM: Roll your persuasion."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (groans)\nLAURA: Oh no, what was it?\nMARISHA: I rolled a two?","response":"DM: Plus?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Plus my persuasion of zero, because I have a shitty charisma.","response":"DM: As your arm reaches for his bicep–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I didn't say anything. I just touched him!","response":"DM: As your arm reaches for his bicep, his hand, belying his grumpy, half-asleep haze– with unnatural speed reaches out and slaps your hand to the side. Not painfully, but just, “No touching the drunk dwarf.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sorry about my friend, Balgus. She's just so impressed with your muscles. We've heard amazing things about you here.","response":"DM: “Have you?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We have.","response":"DM: Tell me, what have you heard?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We've heard that no fighter can match your skill.","response":"DM: “You've heard correct.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We've heard that you know more about this town than anyone else.","response":"DM: “I've been around a bit, yeah.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah. I bet nobody knows more about the Greyspines than you do and they've been around a long time.","response":"DM: “Political ass minds is what they are.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Assmanes?","response":"DM: “Not keen to them– ass minds.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ass mines?","response":"DM: “They've got minds of an ass.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I thought you meant like, mines that ex– Sorry. Go ahead. No, ass minds. Yes, they have ass minds.","response":"DM: “The Greyspines are no friend of mine. ”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, I've heard they're terrible. What do you do, Balgus?","response":"DM: “What do I do? I own the brewery in town!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasp) You do?","response":"DM: “The only one.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The best brewery?","response":"DM: “The only! Of course it's the best!” I've put everyone out of business. We export to most of Tal'Dorei.“"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This ale is amazing, that I'm drinking right now.","response":"DM: \"Damn right it is!” You set it down and he takes it from your hand a little bit and takes a sip himself and sets it down again. (inhales deeply) (spits)"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It seems that you aren't challenged often in business and in fighting.\nORION: I saunter over. Hello! My name is Tiberius Stormwind!\nTRAVIS: We're all going to die.","response":"DM: He glances over and says, “Dragonborn. I haven't fought one of your kind in a long time.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! Who's the last dragonborn you fought? Do you remember his name?","response":"DM: “I recall his name was 'Broken and Bloody.'”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I think that's a friend of yours.\nORION: No, I know him! I know the Bloody family, they're terrible people. Anyway, my associates and I were wondering if you might come– Is that what we're doing? Trying to get him to come with us?\nLAURA: Anyway!\nSAM: We're trying to find out more about Greyspine. Where he might be or who his associates might be.\nMARISHA: Gee, I'm so glad you came over.\nORION: Would you like to accompany us on this journey that we're taking? We're trying to find the Greyspines and you seem like you would want to come in on this.\nTALIESIN: We think there might be something rotten in the mines.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll. You can assist if you like."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm assisting in this persuasion roll, good god.","response":"DM: That just means he has advantage."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, I get advantage?\nTALIESIN: 21.","response":"DM: Yeah, so you get advantage on this roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So you roll twice.\nMARISHA: What was the first thing you rolled?\nORION: Three. I'll take the 18.\nMARISHA: Definitely take that 18.\nORION: Oh and plus my–\nMARISHA: Persuasion.","response":"DM: He looks at you keenly, which–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Which is a nine.\nLAURA: Whoa, you have a nine persuasion?!\nORION: That's why I talk.\nMARISHA: He's pretty charismatic.","response":"DM: He goes, “Well no, I don't really want to go anywhere with you. But if you're looking to go ahead and talk to the Greyspines, you don't want to go empty-handed. It's customary to come with a gift of some kind.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh really?\nSAM: What might they like?","response":"DM: “Well, let's just say, I have the finest brewery in the city.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh!","response":"DM: “I have some fine, very rare, very exotic drinks that I could, perchance, sell to you.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Pay the dwarf.\nLAURA: How much for this exotic ale?","response":"DM: “How exotic you wanting?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We want to get in the door. We want him to like us.","response":"DM: “I can give you the finest of thistle branch, dark blood wine. This was crafted by myself, from a rare bloodthistle branch that I had brought over from the far-off city of Kamordah. This, I personally oversaw. It took me four years to fill this barrel full. It'll cost you 500 gold pieces. But it is a king's red wine!”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do a persuasion check– a perception check to see if he's lying?","response":"DM: This would be insight. Go ahead and roll insight."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to go walk over to Grog really quickly.\nMARISHA: 27.","response":"DM: He seems too drunk to lie."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's just do it.\nLAURA: Tell you what, Balgus. We have some very rare items with us that I think you might be interested in.","response":"DM: “Make it quick! You've got one minute.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We've got one minute? Well, we've got–","response":"DM: “My time is far worth the 500 gold you've already been talking about.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We've got this with us right now.\nTRAVIS: We've got a bunch of dragon pieces.\nORION: Do you like dragon pieces?\nTRAVIS: We've got 37 dragon teeth, one dragon eye, four cups of dragon blood–\nLAURA: We've got this cup of dragon blood! Which I know can be added to ale or wine and makes it quite sensational.","response":"DM: He takes the sealed cup and sloshes it around in his hand. The actual liquid is coagulated to such a point that it's less of a blood and more of a gelatin. (sloshing sounds)"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It gets better with age.\nLAURA: Exactly, a spoon of it!","response":"DM: He peeks it open and (sniffs). “Yes!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think that's really expensive, actually.","response":"DM: “I can have this appraised, but if you want to do a straight trade for the barrel for this, I'll take you up on that.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shit, no.\nSAM: Just go for it.\nMARISHA: Top shelf at BevMo!","response":"DM: He pats it and he goes, “All yours. If this doesn't get you in the door, I'll eat my shoe.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Have you ever done that?","response":"DM: “Maybe, I forget a lot of nights.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Where might that door be?","response":"DM: “Minute's up, you'll have to ask around, but it was great doing business with you.” He walks away from the table."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I put it in the bag of holding.","response":"DM: It does not fit in the bag of holding."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and TRAVIS: What?!","response":"DM: The barrel is too big, you barely got Dork the ox in there. Which, for the record, they did fit a small ox in the bag of holding and then realized later on that there was no airflow."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He came out!\nTALIESIN: I feel like we weren't going to discuss that. I felt that that was in the past.","response":"DM: I felt that was a necessary story."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Maybe if we drank some of it, it would fit.\nLAURA: The troll dick. Is that still in there or no?\nTRAVIS: No, we actually got rid of the troll dick.\nLAURA: Oh, okay.\nTALIESIN: Did we trade the troll dick for something?\nMARISHA: I thought we like used it as a weapon.\nTRAVIS: I offered it up, but by that time it had turned into a slimy–\nLAURA: Ew.\nMARISHA: I thought we threw it at somebody.\nLAURA: Can I stop Adra then and ask her where Greyspine Manor is? Keep, manor, whatever.","response":"DM: “Ah, well I can have him do it.” She pokes one of the barmaiders who turns around. This one's younger, he looks like he's frazzled and maybe new here or at least trying to make his way. He goes, “Okay, I can show you around, just follow me outside, come follow me.” He walks out. He's got a little apron on. He leads you guys outside. He brings you to the edge of the outer walkway of the central ring you're on. He points across the way and what you can see is a series of marble pillars that outline a residential district that opens and consumes the other side of the central ring of Kraghammer. He says, “If you go past far in that way, you'll look for the house of Greyspine. It's the one that has dark black marble with gold tinting inside the spiraling vein of the marble, it's gold. The gate outside is wrought iron, black iron, that's topped with a series of pikes and–” Pike awkwardly looks sickened, not understanding. “The real key point is, if you look on the front yard, you'll see a dwarven statue of the current Ironkeeper himself. That's where you'll want to go.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes, very helpful, young man.\nLAURA: Thank you so much.","response":"DM: “Of course. If you get the chance, you could fill out a little form saying how helpful I've been–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are there suggestion cards here?\nMARISHA: Oh, absolutely.","response":"DM: “Here.” He pulls out a small parchment and hands it to you. It's handwritten with a couple of checkboxes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: You should give us all a copy so you will have multiple.","response":"DM: “I only have one.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, okay, that's fine.","response":"DM: “Sorry!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Confidence needs improvement.\nLAURA: Oh, it's okay, we have a wonderful writer.\nTALIESIN: I'll rustle up a few. That's fine, why not. It's what I do, apparently.","response":"DM: He runs back into the tavern."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do we want to do the manor right now? What time is it?\nSAM: 5:00 or 6:00.\nTRAVIS: We got to sleep.\nLAURA: We might not want to bug him when he's, you know, having dinner.\nTRAVIS: Let's be honest, that gate's going to jack us up. It's going to be full of trouble.\nTRAVIS: Let's sleep.\nLAURA: Well, it's only 6:00.\nSAM: Well, then we have time to do other things.\nORION: How long is a short rest?","response":"DM: Short rest is around ten minutes or so."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I want to take short rest.","response":"DM: You've technically been short resting in the tavern. It's more of like a post battle– like, take a breather, bandage your wounds, settle yourself after a harrowing experience. That's what a short rest is."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What was the arcane magic, the manor?","response":"DM: Oh, what you're looking for is the House Thunderbrand."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I want to head in that direction.","response":"DM: Okay, so you're dividing from the party? Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, I'm going to House Thunderbrand, if anybody wants to come with me.\nLAURA: What are you doing? I can't understand you with that popcorn in your mouth.\nORION: Sorry! I'm going to House Thunderbrand before turning in this evening. I've had a nice little short rest and I would like to ask them a few questions.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, go ahead, okay.\nSAM: Is there any recon that's going to happen tonight?\nLAURA: I think that you and I are going to go to Greyspine?\nLIAM: We'll check out the house.\nSAM: Do you need any help?\nLIAM: Sure, you can come with us.\nSAM: No, I don't want you to say yes.\nLAURA: Then no, we'll stealth our way.\nSAM: She's feeling ill. Does she need to lie down?\nLAURA: Oh, players.","response":"DM: We keep short rest to ten minutes because it makes it move faster. Pike is going along, she seems to be a little distracted, she can't quite understand. She says, “I don't know, I feel like I've been here before. It's hard to explain.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What?","response":"DM: “Anyway, I'm probably going to go rest for the evening.” She heads back to the tavern."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The fuck does that mean?\nSAM: We'll find out next week.\nTRAVIS: But first, whores in the bedroom!\nLAURA: Lovely.\nSAM: Grog and I go in search of a, shall we say politely, whorehouse.","response":"DM: The polite term."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, the cleric's away, the bard shall play.\nTRAVIS: We need a massage. On my crotch.\nLAURA: You and I stealth.","response":"DM: You guys make your way to the Greyspine Manor, you guys head for that, you head to Thunderbrand."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is Grog going to find someone his size?\nMARISHA: Percy and I spend some time making some really nice comment cards for–\nTALIESIN: We're going to make some beautiful comment cards.\nMARISHA: For what's his name?","response":"DM: His name is Balan."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Balan.\nMARISHA: We're going to make some wonderful comment cards for Balan.\nLIAM: Oh, Percy is wonderful with calligraphy; you've shown me.\nTALIESIN: Yes, thank you.","response":"DM: Okay, so you'll get to that. You guys do manage to find what's called The Stone's Pillow."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The Stone's Pillow?","response":"DM: The Stone's Pillow."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I love it.","response":"DM: It's an establishment of comfort and ease, and will run you both for the evening, as you are not Kraghammer locals, 30 gold for the night each."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A bargain.\nSAM: We'll take it.\nLAURA: 30 gold?!\nSAM: What sort of ladies will we find there?\nLAURA: Bearded ladies.\nSAM: What species?","response":"DM: The madam of the house introduces you to a spectrum of ladies, mostly dwarven, and very attractive, you know. This is a nice establishment. There is one gnome. One female gnome. There are a number of male dwarves as well, that are standing at the ready. There is one elf, looks a little shy and embarrassed that a goliath walked in."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And that's our choice.","response":"DM: Those are your choices."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'll take the tallest one.\nSAM: I'll take a dwarf.","response":"DM: Okay. You choose your lady, you take the tallest one which would probably be the elf. As you walk in, the shy elf turns around entirely. She is aggressive and throws you around. You got your money's worth. You get manhandled in a way that you haven't– You're going to be sore in the morning."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Thank you!","response":"DM: Welcome to Kraghammer, gentlemen."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I like it already.\nLAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: Are you just walking up to the manor?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, we're going to try to check out what it looks like. See what the guards are like.\nLIAM: Yeah, we'll pretend to take a stroll.\nLAURA: Yes.\nLIAM: Pose as a married couple.\nLAURA: Ew, no.\nLIAM: Just for the purposes of sneaking around the house.\nLAURA: (retching)\nLIAM: I want to see what the area's like.\nLAURA: How about we pose as brother and sister, creepy?\nLIAM: You come on to every human, orc, and half-elf in the entire kingdom, but pretending to be my wife for 30 minutes is too much.\nLAURA: Yes. It's disgusting, so no.\nLIAM: You're probably right.","response":"DM: She's got standards."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. So we'll take a stroll. Shop, see what the area's like.","response":"DM: You enter the residential district. It is dark and you see the red stone that permeates the area for a low gentle glow of the entire city is now clustered into these street lamps that are throughout the entire location. You begin to press into the residential district proper. There's some nice homes that are carved into the side of the rock, there's some stand-alone homes that are built out of fine stone. You eventually make your way towards the nicer part of it, where you start seeing some of the more marble buildings, some of the more exotic stonework being used in the construction of the homes. You also notice three of the guards that are part of the city establishment there are following you from behind, curiously. The Carvers."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh shit, the Carvers. Shit.","response":"DM: No weapons drawn, but definitely hands at the ready."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and LIAM: Okay.\nLIAM: Well, we could just keep walking.\nLAURA: We could, but that could be bad.\nLIAM: Yes. No, we just want to look at the house.\nSAM: Louder!\nLIAM: I mean we're not going to go sneaking in in the day.\nLAURA: Let's say which ones are very obvious about being pretty, so we look like we're just sightseeing.\nLIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: (chuckles darkly) As you continue to walk, eventually some of the dwarves approach."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I point and say: Oh! Look at that one, with the carving, it's amazing!\nLIAM: The architecture is divine.\nLAURA: Divine!\nSAM: (snorts) They're posing as the Howells?\nLIAM: Lovey, would you look at this dwarven home?","response":"DM: (snobby voice) The marble texture on this is gorgeous. You get about 20 more feet before you get, “Hail! Hail!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my! Yes? (giggles)","response":"DM: “You foreigners are wandering too far in districts you don't belong to. What's your business?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh I'm so sorry, I was just so amazed by the architecture here. I wanted to see the beautiful sculpture.\nLIAM: We definitely are visitors here, sir, no one has explained the rules to your city. We were just taking in the fantastic architecture and history of Kraghammer.\nLAURA: We were told there was a beautiful sculpture down the street of the ruler of Kraghammer?","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh jesus.\nTRAVIS: Oh god.","response":"DM: Either of you, whichever you prefer."}
{"prompt":"SAM: If only I was there.\nLAURA: 21.\nTRAVIS: Wow! Pretty decent, good for you.","response":"DM: The guards look at each other. The one that was talking to you, you can see now, as he comes a little closer into the light, a frazzled black beard that's pulled into a very tight braid that goes down to his bellybutton. All wearing the same basic chest plate; long, black velvet cloak behind; each carrying some sort of heavy warhammer around the side of their belt. Steps up and says, “Well, just to tell you the rules here, if you're going to wander at night in a very expensive district, you don't want to do it by yourself because you either have chances of being mugged or arrested. We might have arrested you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no! I'm so sorry! Well, do we need protection?","response":"DM: One of them looks over and sees the bear that is off in the shadows nearby."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I thought Trinket stayed behind. Cool, cool!","response":"DM: Trinket's quietly trying to keep up with his wonderful master."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come along Trinket, there there's nothing to be scared of.","response":"DM: “What's a bear doing in Kraghammer?!” They all grab out their warhammers."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no, please, he's quite harmless. In fact, he's very scared of most people.\nLIAM: He's completely trained. He does tricks. Doesn't he do tricks?\nLAURA: He does. Trinket show them your wonderful shake trick.","response":"DM: At which point Trinket, (subdued growling) just shakes his whole body. He looks at you, confused."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's good.","response":"DM: Then raises a paw up, and– (bear noises)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: If you put your hand out, he'll shake your hand.","response":"DM: (growling)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, see!\nLAURA: Yes?","response":"DM: “–don't bring it here.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, good to know. Trinket, head back to that tavern, would you? People are getting nervous.","response":"DM: (growling)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I love you.","response":"DM: Trinket begins to walk back. A couple of other dwarves that are wandering carrying some packages to the side make a very wide berth around this armored bear that's slowly moping its way through the streets of Kraghammer. What could possibly go wrong?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's so cute.\nLIAM: He's a sweetheart, he's fine.","response":"DM: (growls) You hear in the distance. The one goes like, “Look, I'll show you to the statue and that's it, then you got to go.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, this one's amazing.","response":"DM: “This is what you were talking about, Greyspine Manor. Lot of rich sons of bitches.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wow, so you said the Greyspines own this one?","response":"DM: “Aye.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's stunning. We only heard about the building itself; what can you tell us about the people who live here?","response":"DM: “Bunch of rich sons of bitches.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, we can tell that can't we?\nLAURA: Oh, really?\nLIAM: Not liked by the rest of the city, then?","response":"DM: “Oh, they have friends everywhere, but I personally don't like them. They run business pretty dark. They work most of their employees to the ground. To the bone.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: “I don't think that's how you run a business. Well, that's how you run a business for profit, but not for–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wow. It sounds like they would run the mithral mine which we've heard is so hard on its employees.","response":"DM: “Aye, that's the one.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, really?","response":"DM: “Yeah. I don't know, I don't go that far south, doesn't interest me."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Nor us.","response":"DM: \"Smells like brimstone.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't blame you.\nLIAM: We prefer the company of good hard working people, like yourself. We're very impressed with the work the Carvers do in this city, from what little we've seen so far, so hats off to you.\nLAURA: Thank you so much.\nLIAM: Thank you. We follow for a couple of blocks, behind them for a bit.\nLAURA: Make sure that they're paying attention to us.","response":"DM: Mm-hmm."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: Then we stealth and–\nLIAM: – split off, yes, we can split off.\nSAM: Am I currently being beaten by a whore dwarf or anything?","response":"DM: Make a constitution check!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Constitution check?\nTRAVIS: Hang strong, buddy!\nORION: That's a mouthful. 'Whore dwarf.'\nSAM: 18!","response":"DM: Plus your constitution modifier. Actually, athletics! Go athletics!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Plus two! 20.\nLIAM: Are you making a sex check?\nSAM: Yes! I'm sex checking.\nTALIESIN: Whore dwarf!","response":"DM: That happened. That's the first time."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (grunting)\nLAURA: This is so uncomfortable.","response":"DM: So that happened. What'd you guys roll for stealth?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20.\nLAURA: He rolled a 20, I rolled a 15.\nTRAVIS: That's okay!","response":"DM: As you guys begin to wander off–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No! They're professional Carvers.","response":"DM: – Vax, you vanish. Vex, you take a couple steps. You hear, “Hey, hey, hey! I told you, it's dangerous down there in the dark! Don't do that!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course!","response":"DM: “Where's your friend?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, he already went back to the tavern that we're staying at. I was wondering if maybe you could show me around the rest of the town?","response":"DM: He looks to the other guards and they're obviously fed up with his flirting, and they're not too keen on you guys. “Well, you guys hold up post, I'll give her a quick walk around.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Thank you so much.\nLIAM: I wave off from the alley that I snuck in to.\nLAURA: Yeah, go do your shit.\nLIAM: You do your shit, that you do! Then I head back through the shadows.\nLAURA: Whoosh! Damn it!","response":"DM: You ask around, and it takes a while, especially since as a dragonborn some folks are like, “Oh, I'm not talking to you!” Some others are like, “Oh, yeah, right over that way!” It's a completely wrong direction, so it takes you a good two hours to eventually find your way to House Thunderbrand. When you get there, it's a beautiful alabaster building: large, white dome, with small spires built in to one of the more elevated ceilings of Kraghammer proper. On the outside, there is no gate, just an open lawn. You see grass, you see normally outside flora and fauna currently adorning the scape around this structure."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Whoa. Well, this is a lovely sight! I'm going to saunter on up to the door!","response":"DM: Nice! Go ahead and make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Where is my perception–? Oh. Five.","response":"DM: Five? You saunter right up to the edge of the grass line, and get one step on what suddenly becomes visible to you: a rather subtly carved dwarven rune in the ground. In fact, there's a bunch of them, outlining the entirety of the grass. As your foot hits the rune, you're like, “Oh, that's a dwarven rune!” (stomping)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: That's a good voice!","response":"DM: (as Tiberius) I've been practicing my Tiberius."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's close.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Uh-oh. Saving throw?\nLAURA: You got it, Tiberius!\nORION: What is this?\nMARISHA: Dexterity.\nORION: Oh! That's a 15.","response":"DM: 15?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Mm-hmm.","response":"DM: You manage to pull back to lessen the impact, but a bolt of bluish energy bursts out from the rune in front of you, throwing you about three or four feet behind the rune. You catch yourself. You do suffer eight points of thunder damage."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay.\nMARISHA: Damn gated communities.\nSAM: This is why we go to brothels instead of sneaking around at night!\nTRAVIS: Yep! No lightning attacks!","response":"DM: It's a whole different kind of damage you can suffer!"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay. Well, I dust myself off. Apparently, there's some security. Hello?! Anything happen?","response":"DM: You wait about two or three minutes, no response."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Two to three minutes? That's a long time.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I have a feeling they're not going to respond to the crazy guy.\nORION: Very well.\nTRAVIS: What're you two doing?\nTALIESIN and MARISHA: We're making comment cards! Yes!\nTALIESIN: You're all going to have comment cards that you are expected to fill out when you return back to the bar!\nSAM: Hugely important!\nMARISHA: Yes, because– what was it? Baldus, Beldus?\nSAM: Balgus?\nMARISHA: Balan! Balan was so nice!","response":"DM: There we go. Balgus and Balan."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What do I see around the place? Do I see any large rocks, or any large pillars that I can–?","response":"DM: Best from what you can tell at this distance, because it's fairly dark down here: the building itself has four corner spires around the large central dome structure. Each one of these spires is a very thin, tall, alabaster spire that at the very top is crested with some sort of bluish crystal that comes to a point. They're probably a good 35, 40 feet tall. About as tall as the rest of the structure is. You can't really tell how far back the structure goes because it meets with the back of the cave wall."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to– okay. I'm going to shoot a Fireball. Right in front of me, roll it like a bowling ball. Just right to the door.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: There's a baby right there.","response":"DM: You are four feet from the door."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! I'm four feet from the door? I don't do that.","response":"DM: You can step back and do it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm only four feet from the door? Oh.","response":"DM: It pushed you back four feet from the rune you stepped on. You're not at the door."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I use that magical earring that we have?\nLIAM: You don't know what's going on there!\nSAM: Episode one. Tiberius kills himself.\nMARISHA: Don't die! I should have come with you! Then I could–\nTRAVIS: Bowl that Fireball, dude!","response":"DM: Tiberius Stormwind is a dragonborn sorcerer. Everyone is level nine currently in the game."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I use Mage Hand. I knock on the door.","response":"DM: From that far away? Okay, the arcane energy swirls up and forms this loosely hand-like appendage that drifts forward. As soon as it crosses over the rune where you stepped on, there is a spark of energy and the hand is dispelled."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Damn these runes. Okay, fine. I will do Glacial Blast right up to the door.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: But not to the door.\nMARISHA: What?\nSAM: You're alone.","response":"DM: Okay. You cast the Glacial Blast forward. The ice begins to congeal across the bottom of the floor. As it reaches the front of the rune, there is another spark of energy and the ice forms up against an invisible barrier that's there and then the ice that's up against the barrier melts extremely quickly, drifting into a puddle of water."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Shit. I turn back and head to the group.","response":"DM: Okay. As you turn around there are four Carvers that are hurrying towards you now, with their hammers out going, “You!”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: What?!","response":"DM: They all surround you on all sides, you have a dwarf on each corner. “You have attacked one of the great dwarven families of Kraghammer! Name yourself and your business before you are under arrest.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Don't speak to me in that manner, I am Tiberius Stormwind!\nSAM: I am snoring after having sex.","response":"DM: Make intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 18.","response":"DM: All four Carvers take a step back, look at each other. “Look, we're just doing our job. What's your business?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I understand that, and I am sorry for losing my temper. I was just looking to ask questions of particular artifacts I have been looking for and this house is the only known arcane house I know that I was pointed to. I tried to reach them and communicate, but I was stopped by the stupid rune I can't figure out! I was turning back to get my tavern to get some rest and come back and try to contact the family the next day! Then I was stopped by you!","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 24.\nLIAM: I've just arrived to New York City, I'm going to smash the doors open.","response":"DM: The dwarf guards look at each other and one of them steps forward and this guy you can see now he has more carvings in his armor, he looks to have a little more rank than the other ones. He steps forward, ruddy brown beard, his eyes itself are pitch black. There is almost no color to the irises. He goes, “Look. I'm letting you off this once, but if you so much as spit in the direction of any other dwarf in the city, we're going to bury you so far underneath the dungeon you won't see the light of day 'til the day you rot, you hear me, dragonborn?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I mean yes, my hearing is perfectly fine.","response":"DM: “Get on with you.” He puts his hammer back at his side. They all separate, stare you down as you walk past."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Good day. Back to the tavern.","response":"DM: Okay. You!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes?","response":"DM: You make your way through the alleyways, eventually back towards the building proper. What would you like to do?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just going to watch, that's all. Do I see any security details? See who's guarding the place.","response":"DM: There are Carvers doing rounds around the city. On the streets wandering through in pairs, keeping watch. You don't see any particular guard outside, but you do see individuals moving past windows. There's a little bit of light from the inside of the buildings."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No Carvers or any sort of guard detail outside the house? Anything like that?","response":"DM: Not between the gates. The yard area and to the front door."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. Heavily heavily guarded by the looks of what's inside and what's outside the gate?","response":"DM: What's outside the gate? You're hard pressed to find a moment where the street isn't visible to some Carver. This area is pretty well guarded. You figure largely because the person who is currently the Ironkeeper of the entire city of Kraghammer lives within that building as well as one of the more powerful dwarven families, so it's pretty well watched."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, I'm going to head back to the inn, then. I'm not going to poke the bear.","response":"DM: You all eventually gather back at the tavern."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (exhausted sigh) How was your night?\nTRAVIS: That was wonderful, I don't know about you!\nSAM: (singsong) I have hickies.\nLIAM: Hickies? Is that a Gnomish STD?\nSAM: Yes.\nLAURA: Crazy! I have some hickies too, actually. What?\nSAM: What?\nTALIESIN: We have comment cards, so this will all work out well.\nMARISHA: Yes! here! Here you go, here you go–\nSAM: Success all around! Did you learn anything, Vex and Vax?\nLIAM: I definitely think we should take the diplomacy route. The place is heavily guarded. There seem to be lots of Carvers.","response":"DM: There's a knock at the room that you guys are currently talking in."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes?","response":"DM: Unless, are you in the tavern proper or have you gone back to– ?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, we're in a room.\nSAM: I'll get it! (clears throat) Hello?","response":"DM: Adra's standing there looking a little nervous and she goes, “Hi, sorry to bother you. Is that bear one of yours?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh!\nLAURA: Yes! Trinket! Isn't he adorable?","response":"DM: “You might want to go,” You hear in the tavern: (aggravated growls)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'll be right back. I head downstairs.","response":"DM: You head downstairs and you can see all the dwarves are now gathered around the fighting ring in the center of the tavern."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: Trinket's now inside the ring with a couple other dwarves around, prodding and pushing it into the ring."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, no! No! No.\nLAURA: Grog!\nLIAM: I followed my sister downstairs.\nTRAVIS: I come down too. It's party time!\nMARISHA: I run down to with Grog.\nLAURA: No, Balgus! Fuck! Trinket, come here! Are we allowed to cuss? Trinket, come here!","response":"DM: You are very much allowed to cuss."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: Isn't that right, guys? Fuck yeah!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, no, and I run into the ring with him.","response":"DM: Okay, as you run into the ring a couple of the dwarves pat you on the back, you get a shove into the ring. It's now Trinket and you–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! I'll take on this bear!\nSAM: What?!","response":"DM: Make a general charisma check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do it! Fuck that bear up!\nLIAM: I'm pushing my way through the crowd.\nLAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: A one.\nMARISHA: Oh no!","response":"DM: Yes!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: First one of the series, everybody! First one!","response":"DM: As you rush and you guys are coming to the front, Balgus sees this and now you can see both eyes are open which means he's sobered up a bit, and he goes, “Oh no! This bear's mine. You want to fight two of us? Oh, it'll wake you right up!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Let's do it!","response":"DM: “Nothing as invigorating as a brawl!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are you going to fucking fight him?\nMARISHA: I cast a fog. Over the ring.\nMARISHA: Okay, I run up in the fog, and I tap Trinket and I whisper in Trinket's ear and I say: Trinket, I'm tapping you out. And I turn into a bear like Trinket!\nSAM: What?!\nTRAVIS: Good!","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait. First, I Polymorph Trinket into a squirrel.\nLAURA: (gasp) You can do that?\nMARISHA: I can. No, a mouse, like a rat.\nLAURA: Little tiny.","response":"DM: Okay. You see the shadows nearby the fog you hear, “Come at me, I'm going to–” You can see Balgus's shadow swinging wildly at the air, angrily."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are you going to fight him?\nLAURA: I don't know!","response":"DM: You grab Trinket. Trinket shrinks down into a tiny little mouse."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I say: Scanlan! Catch Trinket!\nSAM: Jesus, I don't like rats, but I'll keep it. Okay.","response":"DM: Trinket, the little mouse face, the moment you see it, looks very confused, very scared."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's okay. I'll protect it. Don't worry.\nMARISHA: Then I bear form up.","response":"DM: You (whoosh) into a bear form. Now Keyleth is now this giant bear where Trinket once was."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I got my money on Ballsack!\nSAM: Don't bet against the enemy!\nLIAM: In the fog I somersault over some random dwarf and pull out my dagger, but turn it around in my hand and whack Balgus in the back of the head as hard as I can, just to try and knock him out.\nLAURA: Can you see in fog?\nSAM: He's a really good fighter.\nLIAM: Low light.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What?!","response":"DM: You have advantage because you are in fog."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm at the balcony by the way. Watching all this.\nLAURA: You have advantage, roll twice.\nLIAM: Oh, thank you.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we're watching what they're doing.\nSAM: Remember, he's our friend. We don't want to kill him.\nORION: I'm taking a short rest, you all can do this.\nLIAM: 21.","response":"DM: Okay. Balgus's drunken, mist covered state does not seem to notice your approach. He is swinging wildly, though. He has disadvantaged attack on you as you approach. One of his fists swings past you. That is going to be a 12, I don't think that hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No.","response":"DM: You just narrowly dodge out of the way. You can feel the fist just whoosh past one of your"}
{"prompt":"ears. As you come back up, clutching the base of your dagger, go for your strike.\nLAURA: Oh my gosh!\nTRAVIS: Come on taint butter, you got it.\nLIAM: Oh, that's no good. Oh, I have advantage on the attack roll for this?","response":"DM: Because he does not see you, yes. You are currently stealthed."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's much better. 26!\nTRAVIS: That'll work.","response":"DM: That'll hit. Go ahead and roll sneak attack damage on this, of course."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Plus regular?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Don't kill him!","response":"DM: Well, we're considering it nonlethal damage because it's with the base of the dagger."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm having an ale while watching all this.","response":"DM: You're watching a lot of fog, with some shapes moving in it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, and I'm like: This is fog! Probably Keyleth's spell.\nLAURA: I'm blindly looking for Trinket.\nSAM: Trinket's in my hands.","response":"DM: You're like, “Where's Trinket?” You see a giant bear there and you're like, “There's Trinket! That's not Trinket. There's no armor.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, that's right.","response":"DM: You're very confused. Trinket now has no armor, is a slightly different shade–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, he's close enough! Man, come on, I've been around Trinket enough.\nORION and MARISHA: Come on, man!\nLIAM: 27, right in the base of his skull.\nSAM: Jesus.\nLIAM: Fuck!\nLIAM: Bonus action to disengage. Disengage as a rogue.","response":"DM: Well he's going to attempt to grapple you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and LIAM: Oh no.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check; it's probably your best score anyway."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: You manage to just slip out of his grip. Barely. He was about to clamp on. As you step away, he turns towards you and goes, “Oh, well I feel alive tonight! Bring it, all of you! I want to smash a face in.” He's got a little bit of ale froth at the corner of his mouth. It's beginning to drip into his beard. It's quite an awful sight for those that are close enough to see it. The rest of you just see this, shapes and movement. There's still this, “Okay, what's going on?” kind of a feel. You hear Adra in the back going, “Stop this! This is– I can't even see! What are you doing?! Don't destroy another table!” She's frantically trying to stop this chaos. There's now a bear– what are you doing, Keyleth?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm a bear and–","response":"DM: You're a bear."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (like Marisha) I'm a bear.\nMARISHA: What happened?","response":"DM: You're a bear, you want to do anything?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What are you doing?","response":"DM: You see the shape of Balgus like– in the middle of this fight ring."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do some tricks! Do some tricks! Start clapping and, like, dancing around.\nMARISHA: Okay, that's a good idea.","response":"DM: This is what she tells you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I see her as my trainer.\nLAURA: Dance!\nMARISHA: I'm like (growling). I'm circus bear-ing.\nLAURA: Everyone! Gather round and watch the amazing Trinket do his tricks!","response":"DM: Yeah, it does."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A rousing jaunty bear-like tune.\nLAURA: Yes!\nORION: I'm going to cast Prestidigitation and do fireworks on top of that.\nMARISHA: You should give me a fez! Can you Prestidigitation me a fez?\nORION: Can I do little hats?","response":"DM: You haven't done a fez yet. You need to work on that. A couple more levels."}
{"prompt":"ORION: No. I'll try. Paper hat!\nSAM: Sure, I would love to give her an inspiration dice.","response":"DM: Bard getting his bard on. Go ahead and make a performance check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Who, me?","response":"DM: No, she does. You're performing as a bear!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Natural 20!","response":"DM: Do you want to add performance dice?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Look at that, a fucking bear dance.","response":"DM: I'm sorry, the inspiration dice that he gave you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: No! It's a natural 20!\nMARISHA: It's a natural 20!","response":"DM: I know. Okay!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, I want to save it! I'm inspired, for later. I will think back to that moment.","response":"DM: You were so inspired, you weren't even inspired to be inspired for this."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.\nLAURA: I grab an empty cup off of the table and say: Tips for the bear, right here!\nSAM: We're going to get money for this?\nTRAVIS: Of course.\nLIAM: I beeline to the bar and say: A large mug of ale, please. As soon as it's ready, bring it right over to Balgus.\nLIAM: I can fix this!","response":"DM: “How? Do! Go!”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Quickly?","response":"DM: “Here, go!” She hands you one, doesn't even charge you for it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm still dancing!\nLIAM: Looking for Balgus in the crowd.\nMARISHA: (growls)","response":"DM: “Yeah, there's a happy growl! Oh, it's been so long since I've been outside!” A little tear on the edge of his face. As you approach up his side–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Arm around his shoulder.","response":"DM: Immediately, instinctively, he slaps it off his arm and turns around."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Take this! You are an impressive specimen, my good man. I have never had a fight that amazing in at least a week. That was something to see. Here, take this, and after this one there's three more.\nLIAM: Yeah! Persuasion, you say? 15.","response":"DM: Two rolls, yeah, you have advantage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh! 15.","response":"DM: Everyone still keeps drinking through the fog. It's like a bad sauna in here right now. Everyone's fighting their way through. At which point now, Balgus slaps you on the shoulder, takes a drink, and wanders out of the fight ring, goes and finds a table to sit down and begin chugging what you gave him."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Why don't we adjourn for the evening? Retire to our rooms?\nTRAVIS: Why don't you go change out of bear form?\nMARISHA: Yeah, and I guess I can let Trinket change out of mouse form.\nSAM: Why don't you wait until we're upstairs?\nLAURA: Can I take the mouse? Can I take Trinket?\nSAM: Here, rat-mouse-thing.\nLAURA: Okay, hi, Trinket! Oh, is his armor teeny tiny too?\nMARISHA: Oh, does he have a tiny armor mouse? Mouse armor!","response":"DM: If you choose, while polymorphing him, you could make it as a visual aesthetic. Because it was a quick impact, I would say it looks like a normal mouse right now. Sorry. Next time!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well you're still adorable little– don't poke him.","response":"DM: (squeaks)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I stick him in my little pocket.\nLIAM: I grab a half a mug of ale off the table and say, “Dwarven compatriots, we could not have expected a better welcome here in Kraghammer! We'll see you tomorrow night for round two. Thank you, one and all.”\nALL: Huzzah!\nTRAVIS: We did say three more.","response":"DM: “Aye! (whispers) Thanks.” She gives you like a really earnest like, “Thank you.” You now have a very good idea of how a good third of the tables in this tavern are repaired."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He's tough.","response":"DM: You guys head back up to the rooms."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You put some stank on him.","response":"DM: Yeah, that was like a (vibrating) when you got the impact on him."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't fight him, you guys.\nSAM: Oh, Grog's going to fight him at some point.","response":"DM: I get the feeling that's probably going to go down at some point."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He's going to be playmates with me.\nLIAM: It's just a misunderstanding. I'm sure he's a lovely gentleman.","response":"DM: You guys are heading back up to the room. Which, it's not a hallway built for a bear. Your shoulders are squeezing through."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How big is the room?","response":"DM: Well, each one of your rooms comfortably fits two people, maybe. Like, one and a half?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no. What will I do with Trinket?","response":"DM: If you help push Trinket through the door. Thankfully, dwarves are fairly wide folk, so the doors are built for stouter folk, they're just not very tall. You, actually, have to bend through, Grog, to get into your room. On the bed that you lie on, your legs dangle a good two feet off the bottom, at maximum. You can push Trinket through with a one, two, three! Or you can carry her through as a mouse, and then have her stuck in there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.\nLAURA: Well.\nMARISHA: How long can I keep her a mouse?\nLAURA: Him! Trinket's a boy, all of you, please.\nMARISHA: Up to an hour?","response":"DM: I believe it is, yeah, concentration."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I mean, are there like stables?\nLAURA: You know, yeah. Can I go downstairs and ask about stables? Maybe he can stay in the stables.","response":"DM: You have to talk to Adra. She's like, “There's no stables in this establishment, but we do have a downstairs storage area your bear can probably stay in.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, he's a bear, he's fine.\nLAURA: Trinket, is that okay?\nTRAVIS: (as Trinket) Yeah, I'm fine.","response":"DM: “That's not true.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Just kidding!","response":"DM: “I'll charge you later.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Trinket becomes a bear again. I'd say the room's probably a good 40 feet by 30 feet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, so he's fine.","response":"DM: Half of it's filled with barrels and crates, and storage of dried foods. Trinket comes in and (sniffing) and starts rummaging into one of the half open sacks of dried meat. That's going to be put on your bill."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shit.","response":"DM: You head back to your rooms for the evening to rest."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Take a nap.","response":"DM: Anything you guys want to do in preparation for the next day?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, let's get it on.\nMARISHA: Oh, we should give our comment cards to Balgus.\nTALIESIN: I think we should all turn in our comment cards.\nLAURA: Oh, our comments cards, that's right.","response":"DM: You turn in your comment cards for Balan."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Balan.\nTALIESIN: I can't stress how important this is.\nLIAM: Maybe we should– go ahead, I'm sorry.\nTALIESIN: No, no, really, no it's fine, speak over me, I don't care.\nMARISHA: Here, take him the extras.\nTALIESIN: We're going to give him a few extras so he can have more comments.\nMARISHA: Yes.\nSAM: You guys are so kind with these comment cards.\nLIAM: Perhaps we should all go to bed, and the humans back in North Hollywood should take a pee break. At some point.\nSAM: The humans?\nLIAM: You. You, and you and you and you and me.","response":"DM: Yes, indeed. Do you want to take a quick restroom break for the folks here?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You okay?","response":"DM: Zac?"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: What's that?","response":"DM: Folks here might want to use the restroom real fast."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: You want me to play the intro videos again?","response":"DM: You know what, go ahead and play some of the intro videos and we'll come back here in a minute to continue the game, while everyone rests, and empties their bladders. We'll be right back guys. Hang tight."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Commercial break.","response":"DM: Hello, everyone. Welcome back. We've had our pee breaks. We've had our refills of our drinks. We've got Fireball, so I think we're good for the next venture. Anyway, the party has taken their rest for the evening. Once again, this is one of those weird experiences where you wake up, not because of the sun rising, because you can't see it in the dwarven city of Kraghammer, but eventually you all come to consciousness naturally. What is your plan of action?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, Jesus, we should have all talked about this while we were all peeing.\nTRAVIS: We're going to beat up everybody, right?\nSAM: Are we going to the manor?\nTALIESIN: I say we have brunch, and we go to the manor–\nLAURA and TRAVIS: Brunch?\nSAM: Eggs benedict.\nTALIESIN: I want dwarven brunch.\nLIAM: I want a traditional dwarven breakfast.\nMARISHA: Dwarven eggs are very good.\nTALIESIN: They're small.","response":"DM: Okay, so Tiberius fills you all in about his experience, trying to get into the House Thunderbrand."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: How you almost got killed?\nORION: I didn't, certainly not. I just couldn't get in the door. Rather rude!\nMARISHA: Why did you think that after the magic hand failed that the big thunder ice wave would work?\nORION: What I thought is that I could cover the rune with ice and merely step over it. I didn't think it would dissolve my ice.\nTRAVIS: Did you sleep?\nORION: Yes.\nTRAVIS: Oh. I had to make sure, you know.\nORION: A good sorcerer always all his tricks before turning around, which is what I did. I think we should go back there because I feel that it's significant that I couldn't get in so easily.\nTALIESIN: We will go back there. I don't think it's the next order of business but I think that we're not leaving the city without dealing with that.\nLAURA: Definitely.\nTRAVIS: Do we need to do something with the comment cards?\nLAURA: Oh.\nTALIESIN: Did you not fill out your comment card?\nTRAVIS: No, I did! I know, like, three letters, so like A, F, and A.\nMARISHA: That's okay.\nTALIESIN: That sounds very positive.\nMARISHA: It's the thought that counts, Grog. It's the thought that counts.\nLAURA: Did you put a smiley face next to the A-F-A?\nTRAVIS: I covered my hand in ink.\nLAURA: That works.\nTALIESIN: Very good. I think that went well.\nSAM: Shall we try to make our way to the manor, then?\nLAURA: The Greyspine Manor, with our cask of fancy ale/wine.\nTRAVIS: Does the light ever change being underground?","response":"DM: No, it is a perpetual low red glow from all the stones that are embedded around the streets."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I feel really sleepy and also very awake at the same time.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I know.","response":"DM: Oh, dwarves."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So what do you think?\nTALIESIN: Now I'm curious if there's dwarven coffee.","response":"DM: You guys make your way after your brunch, your delicious dwarven brunch–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Thank you!","response":"DM: – which is very alcoholic."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes!\nTALIESIN: It's like being in New Orleans for the weekend, every meal is going to come with something alcoholic.\nLAURA: You're turning yourself into a dwarf?\nSAM: Did you catch that? He just turned himself into a dwarf.\nTRAVIS: You did?","response":"DM: Tiberius went (whoosh) into a dwarven form."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What kind of dwarf? What do you look like?\nSAM: He's very handsome for a dwarf.\nLAURA: Are you a girl dwarf?\nMARISHA: Yes! You should be a lady dwarf.\nSAM: Oh yeah, what kind of dwarf? A lady dwarf?\nORION: I would not do that again.\nTRAVIS: Oh, you did do that, you did take it as a troll.\nORION: Almost! She shot off the penis.\nLIAM: What is going on?\nTRAVIS: That's where the troll dick came from.\nORION: Don't you remember, Vax? I was almost raped by trolls.\nLAURA: Trolls.","response":"DM: –trolls don't encounter female trolls often enough to have a one track mind. He nearly got himself in a very bad situation. That was remedied by the party attacking and Vex over here shooting off the troll's dick. Which then went in the bag of holding, which is disgusting."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's also where the hashtag not all trolls came from.","response":"DM: Yup, hashtag not all trolls came from that game. That is horrible."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh god. Bring it back.\nMARISHA: Bringing it back.","response":"DM: You guys make your way to the residential district. The same guards are there who were there the previous night that encountered you guys so, as you roll up with an entourage-"}
{"prompt":"SAM: How many are there?","response":"DM: Currently, there are four."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We can take them.\nLAURA: Hi. I wave at Thompson.","response":"DM: He's actually not there. It's the two others that were with you. He is noticeably absent."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh. Where's Thompson?","response":"DM: They look at each other and they're like, “He's been given the day off.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, really?\nLIAM: As you can see, we brought one of your citizens with us to show us a tour of the city.\nSAM: That's you.","response":"DM: “Citizen? I haven't see you about. What's your name?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, my name is Tiberius Kraghammer.\nSAM: Like Johnny New York.\nORION: Shoot, we're in Kraghammer, right?\nSAM: We're in Kraghammer.\nORION: Oh, Stronghammer.\nSAM: Johnny New York.","response":"DM: “What is it, Kraghammer, or what was it?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I meant–I meant Stronghammer. Kraghammer is my father's cousin's side.","response":"DM: “How drunk are you?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I've been drinking since I've woken.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: See, he is one of you!\nTRAVIS: I had a lot of breakfast.\nORION: Oh yay, 19.","response":"DM: 19."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Tiberius Kraghammer.\nORION: I've been very depressed, you know.","response":"DM: Well, what's your business, if I might ask again? You already seen the statue."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, we saw the statue, but we wanted to get a better look at it. We brought this gift for the Greyspines and we wanted to present it to them.","response":"DM: The two new Carvers step forward and look at it. “Ooh!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's really nice.","response":"DM: One of them's like, “I'll tell you what. If you let us taste a bit of that, we'll let you go.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, I mean, I've been drinking a lot of it, sure!\nLAURA: A thimble of it because if any of it goes missing– Is it sealed? Can we tell if it's sealed?","response":"DM: You look at it. It does not have any sort of port or exit on it. It is just a solid barrel."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Maybe, we can save some for them.\nLAURA:. If we open it, it'll ruin the barrel, right?","response":"DM: “Ah, that's right.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Maybe we can save you a bottle of it when we open it inside. We'll give it to you later.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check for that. It's a very persuasion based encounter."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should I roll that one that failed me earlier or my little dice?","response":"DM: The little dice! They haven't come out yet!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (high-pitched) My little, tiny dice.","response":"DM: Itty bitty dice."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Teeny tiny dice. Okay that's better, I rolled a 23.","response":"DM: Okay. They all look at each other. “If you can save enough for all four of us, please do. Bring it back, we'll be looking forward to it.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Do you have any flasks that we could use to fill them up?\nLAURA: We've got some bottles, don't worry.","response":"DM: “We'll be waiting. If you don't show with the drink, we'll go right to our supervisor.” They all nod."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, keep nodding. Here's the thing. I don't know if I can save four bottles worth, but I'll save as much as I can.\nSAM and TALIESIN: Just say yes.\nLAURA: Hey, I've got it covered.\nLIAM: On our father's good name, we will bring you some of this. That is a promise.\nTRAVIS: It's a good name.","response":"DM: They all look about each other. “Fine. Remember, we're waiting.” They all lick their lips a little. They part and let you guys into the residential district. You make your way to the very back. You can see House Greyspine. Once again, guys, for those who haven't been there before, it's a beautiful arrangement. The iron gate around it with spikes on the top. You can see the entire front yard, it's about a good 80 yard walk to the front of the building itself. It's a quite a distance from the front gate and that entire area is filled with like a stone garden with various small sculptures and interesting knick knacks they collected and put on display like as a small museum as you approach the front of House Greyspine. You get to the front door as a large double oak door about ten feet tall, four feet wide, currently closed. There is no handle on the door."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No handle?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hold on, wait. Don't knock on anything. Things shock you here.\nSAM: Let's go knock on the door.\nTALIESIN: I want to double check, see if there's a bell to ring or there seems to be some sort of calling–","response":"DM: Easily enough, you see next to the door there is a small chain that protrudes from the stone wall. It has a small bulbous ball at the end."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ding ding. Ding-a-ding.","response":"DM: You pull it. Not a ding, but a large (clanging). It is a heavier chain than you expected. As you pull on it, you feel a large hammer-like object is slamming into a brass-type material as it echoes and resounds in the building. Definitely announcing your presence."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Percy, can I try?\nTALIESIN: If you must, yes.\nMARISHA: Okay!","response":"DM: Boosh! It echoes into the house."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I just wanted to do that once! I'm sorry.\nSAM: Should we ding-dong-ditch?\nLIAM: Scanlan perhaps a little ditty on strings will ease our introduction.\nTALIESIN: “Calling,” at the very least. I thought you would go right there.\nSAM: Yes, it's true.\nSAM: Yes, for now.\nTRAVIS: Percy?\nTALIESIN: Yes, Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.\nORION: You can call him Percy.\nTALIESIN: You can simply call me Percy, thank you. We're here to discuss some business with Lord Greyspine and we have, of course, brought gifts and our charming company.\nLIAM: As well as our dwarven compatriot to introduce us.\nORION: Yes, who? I am quite drunk right now.","response":"DM: He gives you an awkward look. It's like a look of trying to place your face. “Which lord are you looking for?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Actually Nostoc.\nORION: Is he the nice one? I would like the nice one.","response":"DM: “Nostoc, I'm afraid, is currently working at the quarry, if he's who you're looking for.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, of course he is.\nSAM: If Gradon is here, is that his name? Gradon?","response":"DM: He gives you this look. “Gradem is not taking visitors.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course not.\nTALIESIN: That's a shame, we brought this half-barrel of ale right here and some–\nSAM: And some very, very attractive mining contracts, but if there's no one here to talk about them–","response":"DM: He gives you this look. “If you're talking mining contracts you want to head to the quarry and talk to, Lord–” Looking him up again in my notes. “You want to talk to Nostoc Greyspine. He's the one who runs the quarry. As far as the Ironkeeper himself– I mean no offense, but only official political business.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well, this is definitely official political business. I will also say, could you direct us to the quarry? We are new in town.","response":"DM: “Obviously. Have you not shown them where the quarry is, friend?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I have no idea what's going even going on.\nSAM: Jesus.\nTALIESIN: He's been drinking since very early this morning.\nMARISHA: He's on vacation. You'll have to excuse him.\nORION: I must say, I am having a wonderful time.\nMARISHA: You know, friends are in town, he's showing us around.\nTALIESIN: What was your name, again?","response":"DM: The dwarf gives you a subtle look, goes, “My name is Magrim. I am the servant of the Ironkeeper himself.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Magrim, of course you're the servant. You are filled with poise and sophistication, and of course, above all, protocol. I would not wish you to break protocol which is why some simple directions, for those of us who are wishing to do some official business. You'll be right on your way and your house will return to order.","response":"DM: “Right. The Ironkeeper is not open to business outside of pre-approved political understanding.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course.","response":"DM: “If you don't have a pre-approved meeting put within our ledger, you won't be seen.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course not, but for the mining contracts, however, wouldn't we need to speak to Nostoc? Is there any way– I hear it's very hard to get down into the mines. It's very well-guarded, right? That's why we came to speak to him here.","response":"DM: He leans over and looks at the cask of ale and says, “Down to the mines, you have to go to one of the chain platform posts at the edge of town that will bring you to the base area. Find your way to the mines there. That should be enough to get Nostoc's attention. The rest is up to you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lovely. Thank you so much.\nSAM: One moment, before we adjourn– (whispers) Do we want to try to get into this place, or are we just going to go to the mines?\nLAURA: (whispers) Maybe we should talk to Nostoc first.\nSAM: And ditch this place?\nTALIESIN: Every time we break into someone's house it turns out poorly.\nLAURA: We're trying to get to the mines, essentially.\nLIAM: I think he's still listening.\nTALIESIN: Good man, good day. We'll be on our way, thank you.\nLAURA: Magrim, you've been wonderful. Thank you so much. We plan on keeping some of this ale and bringing it back to the household. Would you like some when we open the cask?","response":"DM: He looks down at the cask, looks up at you and says, “I would not turn down a sip or two.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lovely. We'll be sure to save you a small bottle.\nSAM: I'm going to turn invisible.\nLAURA: You can do that?!\nSAM: And I'm sneaking into the house.\nLIAM: To what end?!\nTRAVIS: That's awesome! Who cares? Light it up!\nSAM: I don't know why!\nTRAVIS: He's gone nuts!\nTALIESIN: We are off the reservation.","response":"DM: “Is that all your business?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I believe it is all of our business.","response":"DM: “Well, good day.” He steps back into the doorway and closes the large oak doors. You are now standing in the foyer of Palace Greyspine. A luxurious foyer, the floor itself is a fine dark velvet red carpet. There are tapestries across the walls and small wooden end tables set at the edges of the hallway, this foyer area that contains sculptures and vases and plants that exist underground specifically. There's a large stairway that leads up into the upper portion of the house and two doors at each side that lead to rooms you no longer can see."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I use the earpiece and whisper: What are you doing, Scanlan?! What are you doing?!\nSAM: I don't know! Give me 20 minutes!\nLAURA: 20 minutes, that's okay! Let's all step away from the house.\nMARISHA: Ask if he needs assistance or divergent–\nTALIESIN: Divergent?\nMARISHA: Divergent.","response":"DM: Magrim wipes his hands and walks away going, “(sigh) Fucking foreigners.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I follow him where he's going.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: My nervousness, I let out a little bit of a fart as we–","response":"DM: Make a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Why are you making it harder on yourself?\nSAM: 14 plus I'm invisible, plus two. 16.","response":"DM: Because you're invisible, I'll give you advantage on that. Go ahead and roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, well. 14. Plus two. 16.","response":"DM: As you scamper by, behind Magrim, following him towards the kitchen area of the abode, Magrim stops and turns, rubs his stomach, goes (groaning) and continues walking forward, seemingly unperturbed by the sound."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm snooping around, trying to see if there's any lords or higher ranking individuals in the area.\nSAM: Shawm.","response":"DM: A shawm. You find another shawm within, more finely crafted than the one that you have."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh fuck.","response":"DM: A gift of lords, if you will."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm so tempted, but no.\nLAURA: Does he have an earring on? Does he have one of our earrings?\nLIAM: We all do.","response":"DM: Not everyone, you only made a few."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Just me and him.\nLAURA: Who all has an earring?\nSAM: He can talk to me, apparently.\nLAURA: Tiberius, tell him to look for paperwork of something. For the mines!\nORION: Scanlan, look for paperwork of something else, and by the way, all of you should be hearing me right now, you all have the ear–\nLAURA: Not everyone. You only made like five or something.","response":"DM: You could only afford five."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's right. (clears throat) Do all those things, Scanlan.\nSAM: Great.\nTRAVIS: Who's talking right now?","response":"DM: As you look about the household, you also come across a couple of bed chambers that are locked, pretty hefty lock."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Not going to try.","response":"DM: Okay. You make your way up the stairway, and there's a long hall that leads to, essentially, a throne room that is still partially under construction, mostly finished. It actually was an intentional build onto this house. House Greyspine, when the current Ironkeeper went into office, it seems, began to have this room built. It's nearly finished, but it's an extravagant room with a large stone and dark metal throne, steps lead up to it, and its raised dais-like pedestal in the center of the room. A series of great magically glowing and flickering lanterns across them. There are two dwarves inside that are currently finishing up the stone work. They're doing various sorts of masonry and plastering in areas and carving out and chiselling out pieces of stone, and making them intricately carved in this flavor. Other than that the room is currently empty."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Shit. There's nothing to steal!\nTRAVIS: Drop a deuce in the bedroom!","response":"DM: Hashtag “gnomishdeuce.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Damn it, Scanlan! Just get out of there! What are you doing?\nLAURA: You totally should!\nTRAVIS and LAURA: An invisible poo!\nSAM: I might as well try one of the doors that's locked, and see if I can pick it, but I'm not good at that, so I'll try.","response":"DM: Okay. Do you have on your person any sort of thieves' tools?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I have a forgery kit, a poisoner's kit–\nMARISHA: Forge some thieves' tools real quick.\nSAM: Climbing gear? And a whip.\nLIAM: Matt, I have one of the earrings, and I say: Scanlan, what exactly is the purpose for this little escapade, and will it be ending shortly?\nSAM: Can I reply?","response":"DM: You can, through the message-based ear enchantment."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Just trust me that I have no idea what I'm doing.","response":"DM: Do you wish to pick one of the doors?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do it.\nSAM: Yeah, I'm going to try one!","response":"DM: Okay, you have disadvantage on this."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Of course I do.","response":"DM: So roll twice, and we'll consider this a straight dexterity check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 11, plus zero?","response":"DM: You futz with the door for a good minute, trying to bend a piece of wire you had, thinking to forge some tumblers, and eventually get to a point where you hear, (tink). And it broke."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can't do two spells at once, so I will give it up and I'll make my way to the door.","response":"DM: Okay. The door is currently closed."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I become un-invisible and I cast Dimension Door.\nSAM: It was crazy in there! People were farting everywhere! It was not me. They're building a throne room, there were some locked doors. Man, I wish you could have been there! It was exciting, but ultimately pointless. Let's go down to the mines!\nLIAM: I would like to stress again that none of these dwarves are our enemies, at all. We just want to go have some words with Greyspine.\nTRAVIS: That we do not have our healer, at present.\nLIAM: Well, we do, but she's very distracted, and is not feeling herself.\nSAM: She wanted to stay at the inn this morning.\nLIAM: She's feeling awfully BAFTA today, so.\nSAM: Let's make our way to the mines, shall we?\nORION: Metal poisoning, yes.\nTRAVIS: To the mines, then, yeah.\nLIAM: Let's go get this drunk dwarf!","response":"DM: Yes, the bard was doing a lockpick with no lockpicks. He was fashioning it from wire. Exciting but pointless! You make your way to the edge of the center ring. You find that there are long spiral staircases that move to the bottom, where there are elevators that bring you to the bottom floor. The elevators are chain based, like a ratchet-type system with two Carvers there, of course. You approach one, eventually you talk with them, they lead you down there, but once again they give you a look of, “Watch your back!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We point at the ale and give him a thumbs up!","response":"DM: They nod, and let you pass. As you continue downward into the lower area, you can see the red stone that lets a lot of the atmospheric glow of Kraghammer is used less and less and a lot more central torches are now in place; sconces. The stone itself is either rarer the further down you go or has less of an illuminating power the deeper into the earth. You eventually reach into the center part of town. You now see from where you're standing a number of large structures in the very center of the bottom part of the city of Kraghammer. You can see– There is a giant domed temple that is made of gold and bronze in the center. It looks almost like a gargantuan gazebo that has doorways on each side that is currently closed off. No guards at it, though. You do see a number of other buildings. There is a large, heavy foundry far off to the left of you that has a little bit of smoke that's coming off of it, but most of it looks to be filtered into a giant, metallic funnel that is then placed into the rock. Almost like all the smoke based exhaust is being funneled outside of the mountain. That is the closest; that's the foundry. Then to the right of you, you wander a bit and you can begin to see that part of the mountainside to the far right has that look of a strip mine, or like a large portion of the minerals has been pulled away and is currently being mined further. That looks like probably one of the better places to look in looking for the Greyspine Quarry. You eventually make your way to the outside of the quarry. You now look down into three large pits that descend deeply into the side of the mountain. This mine has been going for quite some time and a large chunk of this looks like it may be being prepped; almost like the mine is what's growing Kraghammer. The more they mine into the mountain, the more they fill the mined area with further city construction. It's this self perpetuating cycle of expanding the city downward. Currently in the quarry, there are a number of large stone dwarven buildings in the edge of it, one of which is the largest of them all, looks like it's made more of a black and red, iron aesthetic; some of it's been oxidized a little bit and has that rough and tumble, iron feel. That one has the most guards around the base of it. The Carvers are gathered entirely around it. Looking down into the center of the quarry, towards the bottom there are a number of tunnels that lead into the hillside of Cliffkeep Mountains proper, surrounding Kraghammer."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Let's go where the guards are.\nLAURA: Let's walk towards the guards.\nLIAM: Let's just do this directly, I think.\nSAM: Just swords out.\nMARISHA: Wait. Before we go up, I take the cask of ale and I grow some pretty flowers on it, and I make a nice pretty bow and I shine it up a little.\nTALIESIN: You're making a fruit basket?\nMARISHA: No, I'm just– it looks attractive now.\nTALIESIN: It looks like a fruit basket.\nMARISHA: It does not look like a fruit basket. It's not that ostentatious.\nTALIESIN: It's the “Ale of the Month” Club.\nLIAM: In her defense, they probably don't see flowers too often. It's a nice touch.\nTALIESIN: That is very fair.\nORION: I'm going to take this opportunity to cast Stoneskin on myself.","response":"DM: Okay. Stoneskin is placed on you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are you a dwarf still?\nTALIESIN: Are you a dwarf made of stone?","response":"DM: You have not turned Alter Self off. You are still a dwarf."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, that's fine.","response":"DM: Oh, Stoneskin is a concentration spell, so yes, that would eliminate the Alter Self spell. Okay, so you revert back to your dragon form, robed self, but Stoneskin is in effect. You using your, what's it called again?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Druidcraft.","response":"DM: Druidcraft! Thank you. The Prestidigitation for hippies. Portions of the wood begin to sprout from the outside of this dark wood barrel and form these entangled ivy vines that eventually embrace the entirety of this cask with little buds of dark, ruddy flowers. Something that would definitely appeal to a dwarven aesthetic."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's hot.","response":"DM: You approach the guards, of which there are eight currently at the front."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I use my perception to see which one of them looks maybe the most interested or weakest?","response":"DM: Would be more of an insight."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Insight! Which one of them looks most interested in our party.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, good. I thought that was a one, but it's not. It was a 13.","response":"DM: 13? Okay. Strangely enough, they are fairly distracted and after a rather long, uneventful morning, most of them are used to being in armor and waiting for business to go down. There are a few along the edges that look a little more alert, and one of them is looking occasionally down into the quarry. Just keeping an eye on the established area."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Which one looks like the newest?","response":"DM: The newest of the bunch would be the one that's on the far left that is looking down into the quarry as well. He has a shaved head, has a small brownish beard that looks like he's starting to grow out into a nice, long tuft. Either it got shaved in some, I don't know, terrible college dwarf accident. You know part of his entry into some fraternity."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Dwarf Sigma Sigma.","response":"DM: It's a fairly thick tuft of unkempt brown beard that goes about that far out. It's starting to be pulled in like tiny little scruffy braids. It's not quite there and he probably gets a lot of shit for it from the other dwarves. He seems to generally be looking at you guys."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, work your magic.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, do your thing– fuck these dwarves up.\nSAM: What are we trying to do?\nLAURA: We brought this gift. Hello! We address all of them, maybe, right now, yes?\nTALIESIN: She is better at this. I'm going to let her do this.\nLAURA and SAM: Hello, hi!\nORION: Greetings and salutations!","response":"DM: The other guards reach back and grab their weapons. One of them looking to you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, you don't need that.\nLAURA: I look over at the shaved-head one and I hold his gaze for a little bit.\nLIAM: I give Vex a little push forward.\nLAURA: Pardon me. Not yet!\nLAURA: Oh, yes, well– we are here to speak with Nostoc. We brought a gift for him that's quite remarkable, actually.","response":"DM: They curl up around the apparent barrel that Grog's holding. They look wary of Grog, but once they make note of the barrel they all, “Ooh!”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right? It's the shit.","response":"DM: “I've heard of that, but I've not seen anyone actually drink it. There were long standing rumors that this even existed.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It exists.\nSAM: And it's for Nostoc.","response":"DM: “This is a Balgus original?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.\nMATT “Signed by himself I see on the burned, emblazoned wood. I'll go talk to him!” He heads inside of the building, the doors close behind him. The other guards encroach, keeping a very keen eye, each one having a bead on the rest of your group. About two minutes pass before he comes back, opens the door and the dwarf goes, “Nostoc will see you briefly, but you best bring the gift. I think that's what's holding his interest.”\nORION: Wonderful!","response":"DM: “Inside, please.” Him and one other guard flank you guys as you enter, making sure that you are not left without that appearance. You are led into the center of this portion of the mine's main structure, a series of long hallways. There's this general smell of soot and ash and broken stone dust in the air. A hint of brimstone-ish smell. It's not very pleasant, it's very well worn and pungent for those of you who spend most of their time on the surface. As you enter, there is a general dust in the air, a little light seems to peek through from the torches that are placed up along the wall. You can see this general haze amongst the interior here. It's definitely a work environment at the base of an underground dwarven establishment used to mine. You are led further down the hallway. It curves to the left and you're brought into a large dwarven study. There are books on the walls, a series of ledgers and paper stacks on a large desk and at the center there sits a dwarf with fiery red hair cut very short, almost like a buzz-cut on the top, with a long beard that is not braided, but kept very smooth and very– not curly, not bunched, it's a very straight beard. He's very clean cut, he already has this intimidating dark glare. As you walk into the room he goes, “Okay, you brought me a drink. You have my attention. What brings you to the mines?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We should have talked this through before.\nTALIESIN: Well, several things actually. Several things bring us to the mine. My name, of course, is Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.\nALL: You can call him Percy!","response":"DM: He raises his finger and goes, “You have not paid for your pleasantries yet.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, of course. Grog, if you would.\nLIAM: Tap that motherfucker!\nTRAVIS: I am assuming he had a goblet on the table.","response":"DM: As you pull it up he pulls under his desk and pulls up a goblet. As you fill it, “Top it off! Thank you! Now put on the side of the desk!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it as amazing as we've heard?","response":"DM: “It's pretty fucking good.” He takes another long drag, while making sure you all watch him do this. This goes on probably a little longer, the pageantry of him drinking this in front of you is definitely a power play, and he's establishing some sort of unspoken dominance in the room. Eventually he finishes his tankard, sets it down under the desk again. “Right, so where were we?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We were here to call upon your expertise. We imagine that we are not the first strangers to Kraghammer to come through–\nLAURA: – in the last few weeks.\nTALIESIN: In the last few weeks. We believe one of our compatriots had some dealings with you, perhaps not as pleasant as the dealings we are hoping to have.\nSAM: A lady, in fact.\nLAURA: A halfling.","response":"DM: At which point, as you say that, he gets this grin to his face and goes, “Aye, I know of the one you speak.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: “She is a strong-headed one, that one.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: “She stepped on a few toes around this place.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, was she clumsy?","response":"DM: “One could say that, aye. You say you are compatriots of hers?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're here to mend any broken bridges, so to speak.\nMARISHA: Or broken toes, if you will.","response":"DM: “She certainly left a mess in her wake. There's this strange vision quest she kept talking about. It brought her into atmospheres– portions of this city, portions of my business that she has no right trespassing on. She went against Carver rules, she broke away from partial arrest and she went screaming down into the caverns of our mines without my permission, blade drawn on some crazed suicide mission.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You know what? We'll go after her. We'll bring her out. We'll get her out of your mines.","response":"DM: “Great. I'd like that actually.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good!\nTALIESIN: We'd be happy to clear out anything unpleasant that we happen to find in there in the meantime.“\nORION: How did she look?\nTRAVIS: What?","response":"DM: \"She looked small and angry. She seemed to have some weight to her. She was a strong lass.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: So not a looker is what you are saying.","response":"DM: He gives you this strange look and goes, “I will not discuss the physical aesthetics of a halfling.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: The dwarf is a feminist.\nLAURA: How much would this task be worth to you? Obviously we are doing you quite a favor and we brought you quite a gift!\nSAM: This cost us a thousand gold.","response":"DM: “Obviously this lass means a lot to you, doesn't she?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, but I know she is probably wreaking havoc on your mines.\nLIAM: We've come to correct the wrongs that she's done and come to bring her home.\nMARISHA: It also sounds like there are some other terrible things wreaking havoc on your mines.","response":"DM: “There is nothing going on, we're fine. We have everything under control, we don't need your help for that. If you want to find your friend, go find her! If she is still alive. If not, take her corpse back and leave.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's not help, sir. We are simply respecting you as a businessman. As a businessman I'm sure that you would disagree with unceremonious charity whether it would be to give it or receive it. We are making sure that our dealings with you are fair and balanced.","response":"DM: “I appreciate your offering. You have bought your time. Now, if you are here to go find your"}
{"prompt":"friend, I'll let you pass. You may pass into the mine, but if at any moment you cross over to any sort of thieving bullshite–” Looks over at you. “I recommend–”\n“I recommend– that you fall down the same path your friend likely did and get killed real quick. I don't take kindly to those who cross on my business.”\nTALIESIN: I doubt that we could find anything of more value that what we have already brought you.\nLIAM: We are here to right wrongs and I promise you, our business is finding her and returning home.“","response":"DM: \"Then go.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is that our business?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we are here to right wrongs and right lefts.\nTALIESIN: And write comment cards.\nMARISHA: Wait, before we dive into this mountain– we know that there's ghouls and god knows what else down there. Shouldn't we find out?\nORION: Yes, we should. Maybe some arcane house could tell us how to deal with these things.\nLAURA: Yes. Do we have permission to enter within the next few days? Obviously we might need to be prepared.\nORION: Yes, do we have badges that we wear over so that they know–?","response":"DM: “I'll speak with the men. They'll let you down. If you come back, good on you. I think our business here is done.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: At which point, you hear muffled in the distance a loud ringing of a very loud bell."}
{"prompt":"(dinging)\nAt which point, he perks up a bit. “Our business here is done. Please, shove off.”\nSAM: Which way do we go?","response":"DM: He looks over to the two other guards who are up front. The two Carvers say, “This way.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: While he is talking I take a flask out of my cloak and approach the barrel and surreptitiously pour a little bit of it into the flask.","response":"DM: Sleight of hand check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You're stealing beer?!\nORION: No, because we have to give it to those guards.\nSAM: Fuck those guards, I can kill them all.\nLAURA: Can I talk to good old Nostoc while he's doing that?","response":"DM: He currently does not seem like the talkative type at the moment, you can certainly try."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I am going to make a fumble. I am going to attempt to assist a sleight of hand with a bit of a fumble.","response":"DM: He has already rolled it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Damn it. I am going to fall down. In front of Nostoc.\nSAM: Oh!\nLIAM: 13.\nLAURA: I am going to fall down in front of Nostoc.\nMARISHA: Come on!\nTALIESIN: He is distracted by a bell.","response":"DM: As you fill your flask–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Shit. Balls. Ass.","response":"DM: You hear this loud– (clears throat)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ow, oh my ankle! It hurts so very much.","response":"DM: This is the first time you have witnessed the pristine, delicate yet well trained palm of a dwarven hand go straight to its forehead."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I carry the flask up to his cup and refill it and say: In my kingdom when a deal is set we drink together. I would like, not much, but to pour us all a drink and agree, surely this cask is weeks' worth of drink–","response":"DM: “Get out of my office.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Take the flask, take the flask.\nLIAM: I can see it is a cultural difference, my apologies.\nORION: Stop it. Just go! What are you doing?\nLIAM: You're one to talk!\nORION: I'm on the earring.","response":"DM: A second and a third bell starts going off and the guards that are waiting for you guys. They're like– They start leading you outside and as you make your way outside the main building, you can now hear voices shouting, down in the quarry below."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I lean down to one of the guards and say: What is that bell for?","response":"DM: “Something is flushing out of the quarry.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Flushing, what does that mean?","response":"DM: “We don't know.” Some of the guards are motioning each other to follow and some of them start going down to one of the tracks that leads down to one of the nearest quarry below."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Just try and like practically usher our guards in that direction, since they seem to want to go in that direction. Let's see if we can push them in that direction.","response":"DM: Okay, you guys follow down towards the quarry, you ask the guard that question and he goes, “I don't know, we've had quite a few interesting things come through.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Like what? Oh, like what?","response":"DM: He swallows and says, “Things I can't describe.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well, we can certainly help, lead on.\nMARISHA: Is there anybody running out?","response":"DM: Not yet. As you head halfway down the quarry walkway, you begin seeing dwarves start running out of one of the large quarry tunnels."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I grab one of them.","response":"DM: Well, they're quite a distance from you. You're still walking down the side. They're a good 100 feet from you. They start running at you, you see blood streaking down one of their faces."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes!","response":"DM: They're charging out, one of them has a weapon and is limping, and you start seeing small green scampering things rushing through. One, two, three, four, six, ten goblins come rushing out of the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ah, I don't like these guys.\nLAURA: We should attack them! I string my bow.\nMARISHA: Don't you have family history with them?","response":"DM: The three dwarves that are running out, one of them gets hacked down by one of the goblins and jumps on them and is tearing his neck."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I take a shot. Right now.\nLAURA: I take a shot. I shoot it!","response":"DM: Okay, both you guys roll–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I throw a dagger.","response":"DM: You throw a dagger? Three of you, roll for attack."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 19.\nLAURA: 15.\nORION: Is there a clear area where there's a bunch of goblins running?","response":"DM: There is an open funnel towards the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to throw a little Fireball, right there where those guys are.","response":"DM: Okay, you guys you all hit from this distance because goblins are puny little things. They're still a little small to see, but you're all pretty well trained and pretty honed with your aim. You fire simultaneously, gunshot echo through the hallway, arrows, flying dagger, you see three goblins fall off a nearby dwarf who goes, “Thank–” At which point a large fireball explodes, killing off about ten or so of the goblins and probably two of the dwarves."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sorry about that!","response":"DM: The guards stopped."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Did you do that?\nORION: Yeah.\nSAM: Fuck.","response":"DM: They start looking around and they see you pull out your weapons and they all take a step back and realize they don't want to die either. “Well go, if you're going to help, go!”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We run straight in.","response":"DM: With you guys charging in, you can now see a handful more goblins are rushing out. They are like running really fast, sprinting."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I throw Entangle up, in the distance wherever they're coming from.","response":"DM: Okay, what's the radius on that?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Like a hundred feet.","response":"DM: That's the range. What is the radius?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, 20-foot radius.","response":"DM: Okay. You find a portion of the central point where the things exit from the tunnel and these strange reddish vines begin to protrude and to begin to grab nearby goblins and pull them up in this massive, weird vine creature. You hear (stomping) and you now see two larger ogre-like creatures come storming out."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, shit!\nORION: Wonderful!","response":"DM: Everyone roll initiative."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, fuck. Goddamn it.\nTALIESIN: Oh yeah!\nTRAVIS: Take it!\nTALIESIN: 27.\nORION: 21.\nLAURA: Wait! I didn't roll yet.\nMARISHA: You rolled a 20?\nTALIESIN: I rolled a 20 plus seven.","response":"DM: 21, you said?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I have 21.","response":"DM: 21 for Tiberius. What did you get? One? Aw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I rolled a two.\nLIAM: It's six with the plus.\nSAM: Fellows. I don't like goblins.\nLAURA: 18.","response":"DM: You now see Scanlan, who's usually a jovial individual, his eyes begin to tense with fury."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't like goblins.\nMARISHA: Is there anything that you know?\nSAM: No, they will all die. Don't spare any of them.\nTRAVIS: Copy that.\nLAURA: 18.\nTRAVIS: 18, too.\nTALIESIN: 27!\nLAURA: What?!\nTRAVIS: Yeah, buddy.\nTALIESIN: I have 27 initiative.","response":"DM: 15 to ten? Ten to five? Six."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Wow, oh my god.\nSAM: I got a three.\nMARISHA: Four.\nLIAM: It was a sudden attack, man.\nSAM: We weren't ready.","response":"DM: You got a three."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: To be fair I just cast Entangle. It works. I'm distracted holding Entangle.","response":"DM: Yeah, it's fine. Then we have Scanlan. I'll get you guys in placement here, as your bear is currently back at the inn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He is still?","response":"DM: Unless you wanted to bring him along."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, I thought I brought him. I should have mentioned that.\nLAURA: I'm sorry, I should have emphasized that more.\nLAURA: Oh god.","response":"DM: A number of goblins that are currently held over here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They're easy. Goblins are easy. Orcs are not.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, those are mine.\nLAURA: Ogres?!","response":"DM: Top of the round, Percy you're up."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm sitting down and I'm busting out Bad News.\nMARISHA: Bust out Bad News!","response":"DM: Percy stops just as he gets to the quarry, a little bit elevated, and he pulls out from a small sack on his back this large elongated contraption, this weird construction that looks similar to the pepperbox he usually carries, but much larger and cumbersome. He sets it up on the ground with a small stand at the front and preps itself with a visual point."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ogre.","response":"DM: Ogre back here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yep.\nMARISHA: Have you used it before?\nTALIESIN: Nope, first time.","response":"DM: His own tinkered construction, Bad News."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's a 30 attack.","response":"DM: Yep, that'll do it. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Does that critical for you?\nTALIESIN: 19 actually might.","response":"DM: Natural 19?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Natural 19.","response":"DM: Yeah, that should critical for you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That does critical for me. I've never criticaled with this either. What does that mean?","response":"DM: That means the damage dice you double. Roll for damage, double that, and add your modifier after that."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Come on! Big money, no whammies. Yeah! Hell yeah!\nTALIESIN: (counting) 27 points of damage.\nTRAVIS: Get after it, big man!\nMARISHA: Is that doubled?\nTALIESIN: That's doubled.","response":"DM: You guys hear this cacophonous, large blasting sound, a flash of blue energy and sparks shoot out the back of the weapon. It actually lifts Percy off the ground for a second and he shifts himself from the sheer blast. This streaking, heated bullet, reddish, white hot, goes cascading through the air, plunges into the side of the ogre's shoulder with a smattering of blood splattering against the cave behind it. It's actually moved back a step and has to catch itself. Slams its club into the ground. That ends your turn?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I can't do anything after that. That's just reload.","response":"DM: Tiberius, you're up."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I move within 60 feet of those big fellows.\nTALIESIN: Bad news travels far and fast.\nMARISHA: Nothing travels faster.","response":"DM: This is the entanglement, by the way."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, okay.\nORION: Right before there.","response":"DM: Everything there is fighting from the entanglement. Most of these goblins are currently inside of it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to shoot a Scorching Ray at the big guy.","response":"DM: Both of them?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: He said he moved within 60 feet of them.\nMARISHA: They're all entangled, yeah?\nORION: That's good right there.\nMARISHA: Still have Entagle up.","response":"DM: These guys here are entangled. These front goblins are not. Scorching Ray you said at which ones?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Actually, oh there's a bunch of those dudes, aren't there? I'm going to do a Fireball instead, right in the center of the juiciness where I can get a couple little guys and both the big guys.\nORION: I'm going to do that, and I'm going to spend two sorcerer points immediately to do quickening spell and do another spell right after that.","response":"DM: Okay. As you rush up, you pull back your hand and you see the arcane red energy begin to flow in your palm. You then throw the beam out, and it arcs, slams into the center, and explodes hitting each of these five goblins and the two ogres. What's your DC on your spell?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: My DC on my spell is–","response":"DM: Top of your spell page on the right."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! Wait. Oh! 17, sorry.","response":"DM: 17, okay. Wow! The two ogres actually make their saving throws."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh!\nMARISHA: Boo!","response":"DM: They got 18 and a 19."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Roll crappier, ogres!","response":"DM: The goblins, however, all disintegrate."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: All of them?","response":"DM: There's no way they're going to survive the damage you– they (poofing). You see this hint of a red ash mist go, (squeaking) where they once were, and they are all turned to black nothingness. However, roll damage for the ogres. They get half damage because they made their reflex save. So 8d6 damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 8d6.\nSAM: (counting) 27!\nTRAVIS: What?!","response":"DM: 27, so half that. As the blast of fire dissipates, you can see one of the ogres is now burnt on half of its chest. Looking a little rough. There's blood streaking down from the side of his face where the shrapnel got thrown at him. The other ogre's looking okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: He's a large creature isn't he?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to use my second spell and do Telekinesis and pick one up and try to hurl him into the other one.","response":"DM: Okay. Which one? The one left here?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: The one that's beaten up already.\nSAM: I'm hard right now!","response":"DM: He does fail his saving throw. You lift him up in the air and throw him into that. That ogre is knocked prone by the impact."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Yeah!","response":"DM: The other one is also knocked prone. Before (splatting) into the wall, both of them slam to the ground."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: With my vines, I make sure my vines really grapple him.\nORION: I turn to Grog: They're all yours, buddy!","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll 2d6 impact damage for the force of the throw."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sweet! Impact damage? Ten.","response":"DM: Ten damage to each of them?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Ladies first.","response":"DM: Okay, that'd be this one here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, I do.","response":"DM: Okay. You pull out your arrow and as you pull it back, a little bit of energy courses through your fingers, strikes through your arrow. You can now see this crackling energy as you're pulling it taut in your bow. You let it loose, roll for attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay! 21!","response":"DM: 21 hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Holy moly! So that's this. 13 for the arrow and then 4d8 for the spell. (counting) 17!","response":"DM: 17. Okay. The ogre that's been beaten, blasted by the fireball, it's getting up– (grunt). It grabs its club, and it begins to get up on one leg as the Lightning Arrow slams into its chest. You can see it hits. Looks down for a second, and then the charge pulses through its entire torso. As it does, it screams out, “Ugh!” into the cavern, its whole muscle system locks tight and it falls forward again, onto its chest, smoke rising off of its whole upper area, unmoving, on the ground. He is gone."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Dang! Come on now!\nLAURA: Yes! Then the other one takes 2d8 if he fails his saving throw.","response":"DM: Which, with a one, he does."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes! Oh, he fails it so good.","response":"DM: Go ahead a roll damage for other ogre."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Two. ten.","response":"DM: Ten damage. Nice. As he falls to the ground, the arc arcs over to the other one who drops his club for a second. Picks it up angrily."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I can reassign my Hunter's Mark to him now?","response":"DM: You can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.\nLAURA: Oh, my Hunter's Mark! I didn't do my Hunter's Mark damage. But it doesn't matter. He's dead.","response":"DM: It doesn't matter. You killed him."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (valley girl voice) They are so dead.\nTALIESIN: (valley girl voice) They're just, like, dead. This one moves around, and this one runs around to there. No attacks. Everyone make an insight check.\nSAM: Insight check? Oh shit.\nMARISHA: What happened? Why are we doing this?\nTALIESIN: I literally get a one.\nTRAVIS: (sings) Natural 20! On an insight check.\nMARISHA: 20 total. 20.\nLAURA: 22.\nORION: Four.\nTALIESIN: Natural one. I'm really not paying attention.","response":"DM: You're dealing with the fact that you just fired your gun for the first time and it burned your hands a little. You're like “Ugh!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM and MATT: Grog.\nTRAVIS: Recites poetry.","response":"DM: Grog is familiar with one thing, fear in the eyes of his enemies. Looking at these goblins, they're not charging to attack. The attacks seem to be instinctual. They are running."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, no!","response":"DM: They are scared."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes!","response":"DM: They are fleeing from something."}
{"prompt":"SAM: From the ogres?\nTRAVIS: Something behind the ogres.\nLAURA: Oh, no.\nSAM: May I make a request that you kill them anyway?\nTRAVIS: It's like playing croquet at this point, so yes.","response":"DM: Grog, it's your turn."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would like to rage! And I would like to move to the right of all those stinking goblins!","response":"DM: Right over here?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, a little more to the right. Yeah, a little more. Yeah, keep going. All the way flanking it there. Yeah. Yeah, and then I would like to give them the cleanest shave possible with my greataxe.\nTRAVIS: 18 plus eight. That's 26?","response":"DM: That definitively hits. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, damage, crap.\nLIAM: (sings) Decapitation!\nTRAVIS: Two plus the four. 13!","response":"DM: 13? Okay. As you rush up, you bring your axe into the first goblin to your right (whoosh) clean. You don't even feel resistance. You hear this little (wheeze) sound as this being is bisected."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, that was cute.","response":"DM: Its head and upper torso rolling off to the side before rolling to a stop. However, the inertia of your axe still keeps through to the one on the other side of you. Go ahead and roll for your second attack on that."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 21!","response":"DM: Also hits, go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, that was eight plus seven is 15!","response":"DM: As you cleave through the first goblin, you swing around, another goblin looks up at you, scared, and pulls a dagger out with its gnarled tongue, (hisses), at which point the axe embeds itself straight into its face. Its angry face goes, “Ugh!” and falls slack against your blade. You lift backward, and it's stuck to the edge of your axe. Just limply dangling against– you shake it off a little bit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Double prizes! Yeah!","response":"DM: Great. That ends your turn. The thing about rage is that you can use your bonus action for a third attack. If you wanted to do a frenzy action, but you don't need to. That brings us to the ogre's turn. The ogre gets up, let's see if it makes its saving throw for an attempt to get out. It does with an 18. However, the ogre gets about that far. It's going to make a double move."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Double move?!\nTALIESIN: He's running.\nMARISHA: I still have Entangle up.","response":"DM: I know. He managed to resist it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He saved against it.","response":"DM: It's a big ogre."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Poop.","response":"DM: The ogre takes his full turn to get up in melee with you guys. It does not have its attack since it used its full movement there. Once again, you see as it's lumbering forward, it also has this look in its eye of desperation."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh crap.\nORION: We should just let it pass.","response":"DM: Now it is Vax's go."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: My sister's right in the face of the ogre, correct?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Excellent. I'm going to take a run towards my sister, since she's right close to him, he's distracted so I'm going to turn just as I get to her, so my back presses against hers and swing around and sneak attack two daggers up in his belly.\nLAURA: We've practiced this, I turn.\nTRAVIS: Oh, put it on him brother!\nLIAM: That is dagger of venom, 1d4. Three, plus two is five, and then is the sneak attack damage go with–?","response":"DM: Yeah it does because you have another ally adjacent to it. You don't get advantage on the attack roll, but you can still do the sneak attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Critical hit, too, as well, wouldn't it?","response":"DM: Yeah! You can multiply the sneak attack damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Five, plus- and the double goes to the sneak attack damage?","response":"DM: It does. Modifiers don't double, but any dice you roll double."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Nine, 15–","response":"DM: In my game. (clicks tongue)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So 30 plus five, 35.","response":"DM: 35 damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Plus poison.","response":"DM: The poison's not going to factor in. You swing past her, both blades jam right into the side of its rib cage. You hear it howl out in pain. As it does, you twist the daggers in a way where both blades are now going in two different directions, and you carve out a section of its entire abdomen. As you do, the flesh, like whale blubber, sloughs off the sides of it. Organs spill out, intestines, and it looks down and tries to pull them back in. You see the color draining from its face, and you lean up and kick it down. The ogre and falls to the ground lifeless, destroyed."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You gave him just enough time to regret everything that had ever happened.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well done. Bad life choices.","response":"DM: That brings us to Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I didn't call my mom enough.\nLAURA: There are two goblins left?","response":"DM: There are two goblins left."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. I do a quick sprint jog up towards Grog and go (boof) and bring up a big stone wall. Right where that entrance is.","response":"DM: Right here?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No. Like, right where things are pouring out.","response":"DM: Right, here?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Wall of Stone– boom.\nMARISHA: We don't know what's in there, we should talk about this for a second, and I bought us some time. I'm sure it's going to try to beat through that door in a second.\n(boom)\nMARISHA: Are there any guards around still? Any dwarven guards?","response":"DM: They are all watching you do this now. They don't want to put their lives at risk, and you guys seem intent on getting into the middle of this battle, so they are going to sit back and let you do it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I throw up my wall and turn around and I say: What's coming?! Tell us! You know what's coming. What's coming?!","response":"DM: Make an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Keyleth, you are so hardcore.\nMARISHA: I'm not good at this.\nSAM: You speak goblin?\nMARISHA: Oh, four.\nMARISHA: (tearfully) What's coming?\nTALIESIN: Make a pity roll.","response":"DM: A very gentle attempt at intimidation, however, the message gets across. The guards look at you, taken off guard."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We are about to die. It is in your best interest to tell us.","response":"DM: “We don't know! It's been different things. Strange abominations. It's hard to describe. They're put together. Something's making things down there.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What kind of things? From where?","response":"DM: As they're talking, you hear a (boom) against the stone."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (clicking) Sitting down.\nTRAVIS: I bring out my blade.","response":"DM: The stone cracks, and you can see a noticeable crack and an audible (cracking)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm running right now diagonally towards the wall and I press against the wall.\nLAURA: Oh, good call. I do the same thing on the other side.","response":"DM: Okay, so you come over here. Do you want to bring Trinket with you?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah!\nTALIESIN: You're all so fancy.\nMARISHA: I cast Stoneskin on myself.\nLAURA: We're stealthing, I'm stealthing.","response":"DM: Roll stealth both of you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: How tall are the walls? I mean the ceiling.","response":"DM: Oh, the ceiling right now is the rest of Kraghammer for the most part."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hundreds.","response":"DM: Yeah, it is a huge ceiling."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What's in the middle? Are those fires?","response":"DM: These are braziers here. By the way, Stoneskin goes, this disappears."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The entanglement?","response":"DM: Yeah, the entanglement is gone. There are minecarts, some rocks, there is a smashed cart over here from when the ogre barreled through. This is a piece of stone that rises about 15 feet, and these are both braziers for light in the center of the area. Yeah, it's hundreds and hundreds of feet up. You can look up to the very top of Kraghammer from here."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, that's fine.","response":"DM: Whatcha got? Well, let's see. Keyleth, that's your turn, Stoneskin and moving up. Anywhere else you want to go? Right now, we're technically not in combat."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Right. We're out of combat.","response":"DM: Briefly."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm breathing deep, taking aim at the wall, resetting everything.\nMARISHA: Can I move up behind that pillar?","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm staying far back at the moment.","response":"DM: Back here. Both of these goblins– I'll just say that you guys end up taking them down. It's not even a question. You step on them and crush them."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are there any dwarves that we can say to go get Ballsack and bring him down?","response":"DM: You can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh yeah, Balgoos! Balgus.","response":"DM: Balgus? You tell them, “Get Balgus!” and they're like, “Who?” Some of them have set crossbows up by the way. They're barreling down to get ready to fire at whatever comes through. (impact) Another crack in the wall. You can see the dust settle as the stone cracks again and a large piece at the top tumbles off. The stone wall's probably not going to hold another impact. Anybody else want to move anywhere?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Just taking aim.\nSAM: I'll move up to the right near where Grog is. No one's has taken any damage yet, right?","response":"DM: Not currently, no. You guys have had a pretty clean sweep into this battle, so far."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can't inspire anybody here? Now?","response":"DM: You can inspire anybody. Just give them a dice."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I inspire everyone?","response":"DM: You can spend all your uses to inspire as many people as you have the uses of it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I still have mine that I haven't used yet.\nSAM: I'll inspire Vex and Vax and Grog.\nTRAVIS: Thought you were going to have a little–\nLAURA: I know, some beautiful song for us! Wait, what for all of us? We all get a d8?","response":"DM: Each of you has to have a single d8 dice, inspiration dice. The bardic inspiration is flowing through you, that you can use to add to an attack roll, not damage. You can add it to an attack roll, a saving throw."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (plays tune on electric piano app)","response":"DM: There you go. That's what a shawm sounds like, apparently. You can use it on attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check. Any skill. Tiberius, are you going to stay where you are, are you moving anywhere? Last chance."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is that cover right there next to me?","response":"DM: Right over here? Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'll get behind the cover. I'm going to peek out and I'm going to cast Blur.","response":"DM: Okay, Stoneskin goes away."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I can't do both?","response":"DM: Nope. They're both concentration spells."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, I leave Stoneskin.","response":"DM: Okay, Stoneskin stays on. At which point (boom) the stone breaks through scattering across the ground. Immediately bursting through–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What the fuck is that?\nLAURA: What is it?","response":"DM: A bulbous, oversized, naga-like creature. You've encountered a naga before, which is a large serpentine creature with a humanoid head. However, this one is swollen, it is bulbous. The way it moves looks unnatural and it has affixed to it not one, not three, but five other different colored naga heads stitched to its body. It is a seriously terrible abomination. As it breaks through the stone, (hisses and growls) all the heads rear back."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do naga heads do something if you look at them?","response":"DM: We're beginning back at the top of the initiative order."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh shit!\nLAURA: Wait! I got a question! My Hunter's Mark, can I transfer it to that thing or do I have to–","response":"DM: Correct, you can, yes. Because this still part of the encounter."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sweet!","response":"DM: That is now marked with the Hunter's Mark. Percy, you're up first."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do I have to take new aim or can I have myself already trained on–","response":"DM: You've had a moment to train. You haven't seen the creature until it just burst out, so it would take you a round to aim."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm taking my round to aim.","response":"DM: Okay, so you're aiming. That brings us to Tiberius."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What did you just do?\nTALIESIN: I just took aim. Took aim. Just a gun.\nLAURA: Did we roll initiative again?","response":"DM: I'm keeping the same initiative order."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This gun doesn't do anything fancy. Just shoots really far, really hard.\nORION: Okay! I'll do a Scorching Ray.\nORION: Two– four. Let's shoot two of them right now, right, three of them?","response":"DM: It's an aimed ray attack?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.","response":"DM: Then you have to roll for the attack. Roll a d20 and add your–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Roll high, roll high.","response":"DM: Top of your spell page."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! That's 23.","response":"DM: 23? 23 hits."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, okay. Then that's 2d6. That's 12.","response":"DM: 12 points of damage to the naga. That brings us to–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wait. I roll for the second shot, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, and that's a natural 20.","response":"DM: Okay, so you fire one beam off and it slams into the side of one of the naga heads. The second you bring back and as you do there's a flicker of arcane instability. His arm shakes as he releases the surge of scorching energy as it blasts into the side of the naga. Also, does not make a saving throw again! Roll full damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Holy shit, Tiberius.\nTALIESIN: Oh my god.\nORION: 12.","response":"DM: 12?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.","response":"DM: Multiplied? Or did you roll a 12?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I rolled a 12.","response":"DM: 12. Times two. 24 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! I'm terrible at math! Stay in school, kids!\nMARISHA: This is a good time to note our charity, 826LA.\nSAM: Not yet. Don't donate yet. Donate next week.\nORION: I'll stay right here.","response":"DM: Grog and Vex, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Ladies first.\nLAURA: Oh! Me! Okay, I'm going to shoot– oh god, I didn't realize I was going so fast.","response":"DM: What did you roll for stealth, by the way?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What?","response":"DM: What did you roll for stealth, by the way?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I rolled a 20 for stealth!","response":"DM: Then yeah, he has no idea you're there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sweet!","response":"DM: He sees the bear going (growling)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Trinket's going to hang out because I don't want to– you know. I'm going to shoot Conjure Barrage. No, I'm just going to shoot him twice.","response":"DM: Arrow once, arrow twice, Legolas style."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I am going to do the fire arrow thingy at it.","response":"DM: Okay, so using your bowstring."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The blazing bowstring. Thank you, Tiberius!\nLAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: What was your to hit roll on that?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 21?","response":"DM: 21 hits!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh wait, that's four plus seven is 11.\nSAM: Don't forget your inspiration!","response":"DM: Well inspiration dice is to hit."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, okay.\nLAURA: 11.","response":"DM: 11 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: For the first one, plus for the blazing bowstring I can turn any arrow into a flaming arrow, doing additional ten fire damage. I'll roll that right now, which is this. Which is a seven!","response":"DM: An additional seven, so 18 total damage and that arrow (impact) in the side of its body. One of the serpent heads reels back from the pain. It begins snatching at where the arrow's now protruding from it, trying to break it off."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Then I'm going to roll again! That's a 24!","response":"DM: That hits, go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Awesome. That's an eight.","response":"DM: Grog, you're on deck."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Seven plus seven is 14!\nTRAVIS: Right, I would like to run around the other side of the rock, raging, spit flying out my of my mouth! I would like to use the chain of returning, also crafted by Tiberius, attach it to the end of the greataxe, and throw it from where I am at the snake.\nORION: Yeah!","response":"DM: He comes running around, rears back, and takes his double-handed great axe and lobs it overhand. The chain, that's wrapped around your wrist, keeping it attached to you, in some degree. Go ahead and roll for the attack."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Eight, nine, 17!","response":"DM: 17? It just hits!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! I didn't do my Hunter's Mark.","response":"DM: Roll Hunter's Mark damage right now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Thank you, chatroom!\nSix!\nTRAVIS: This says, “An athletics-strength check is required to pull the weapon free, the DC 12?”","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 12.","response":"DM: Roll a d20."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, a d20.","response":"DM: It's a DC 12."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Shit. Balls. Taint. Five.","response":"DM: Plus–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Plus what?","response":"DM: Plus your athletics!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh! That's bound to be good. Seven! It's 12!","response":"DM: 12 is the DC! So yeah!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I love your joy sounds!\nTRAVIS: Meant to do that! Meant to do that of course.","response":"DM: Now it's its turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: (bursts of wind)"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, come on!\nSAM: What? Why me? No, that's not me.","response":"DM: For its size, when it moves, it moves in a burst of lightning energy. It's too fast for its corpulent form. As it goes behind to Keyleth and Tiberius, it makes an attack with each of its five heads. Two on Tiberius, three on Keyleth. Remember, you guys have Stoneskin, so I believe you have resistance against damage, right?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh yes, I do.\nALL: Oh no!","response":"DM: That's a 12 plus seven, that's going to be a 19 to hit?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Natural 20 again."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What the fuck!","response":"DM: Two critical hits, and a hit on you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What is this bullshit?","response":"DM: On Tiberius, that's a 22 to hit and a 13 to hit."}
{"prompt":"ORION: One does, one does not.","response":"DM: Okay, cool. Against Keyleth, you take–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm glad I cast Stoneskin.","response":"DM: I know. So you take half damage for these. Which is fine."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: That's two plus four, that's six, damage halved, you take three damage. Oh, sorry. Three multiplied by two because it's a critical. So you take six damage from the first strike."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's nothing! Six damage.","response":"DM: Not too bad. You take seven damage from the second strike, and another six damage from the 3rd strike. Actually, it would have been six, four and six. Because you have resistance on the damage because of Stoneskin."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Six, four and six?\nMARISHA: I should have taken the poison resistance. He talked me out of it. What am I–constitution.","response":"DM: Yeah, constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fuck!","response":"DM: Natural one? Natural one on the constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!\nMARISHA: It's a bad day.\nSAM: Keyleth dies in episode one.","response":"DM: You suffer 31 points of poison damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 31, on top of the six, four and six?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are you okay?","response":"DM: The poison damage is not halved because it is not a physical attack on your body."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is Keyleth unconscious?\nSAM: No, she's okay.","response":"DM: Tiberius you take 13 points of damage halved by Stoneskin so you take a total of seven. Also make a constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"Whatcha got?\nORION: It's a 16.","response":"DM: 16, you manage to physically resist the poison in your system. You feel that slight tinge, the muscles tense, but then your dragonborn form begins to shrug off the effect of the venom."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Can I turn to him and blow fire out of my nostrils?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's what I do.","response":"DM: True dragonborn challenge. That brings us to Vax."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, I start jogging backwards.\nMARISHA: Took me down to 16 hit points.\nLIAM: Can I sneak attack while prone?","response":"DM: You're stealthed currently, so you would technically get a sneak attack, but you have to be in melee for you to get the other bonus. It would be sneak attack for this damage if you were to roll or if you were to throw a dagger at it, you would get the sneak attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so that means one throw instead of two?","response":"DM: You can throw both daggers at it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: If you do a really good roll then you don't need it.\nLIAM: Okay, 19 plus 11 is 30.","response":"DM: Because you're a rogue, isn't that critical for you?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah. Oh, yeah.","response":"DM: Two criticals!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The other one, the other one is a 16 plus, plus– is a 26.","response":"DM: That also hits. You chuck both daggers out, they both arc around. You're used to throwing around–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I meant to say I was aiming at its eye, the main head's eye.\nLAURA: No, you should've said that first.","response":"DM: For flavor it's fine. Just go ahead, it's fine."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Four!\nLIAM: (counting)m 20. 20 times–is 40 plus four. 44, that's the first dagger?","response":"DM: Yeah, 44 damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 44.\nTRAVIS: Damn!","response":"DM: Rogues, man."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Help me. Help!\nLAURA: That's just one dagger?\nLIAM: That's just one. Four plus two is six. Is that sneak attack? No.","response":"DM: No, only one sneak attack per turn."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.\nLAURA: 40 and then six on the other one.","response":"DM: One actually hit one of the heads, one of the various naga heads directly into its face. As it does it goes through both eyes and you can see it begin reeling from the attack. It's looking pretty rough, actually. The stitches beginning to come apart at some of the seams and you can see a black ichorous liquid spill out from some of the suture marks."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just a reminder the daggers, folks, blink back to the belt on my waist.","response":"DM: Because magic. Magic rogue shit. Keyleth, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Kill him!\nMARISHA: Okay, so I'm really upset, really hurting. Out of anger I take my staff and I go (bam) and I crack and do Thunderwave pushing him back 15 feet.\nMARISHA: Okay, 2d8.","response":"DM: As you're setting up your gun it gets slammed right point blank to you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh sorry. It takes four damage.\nMARISHA: Then I'm going to turn into an eagle.","response":"DM: We'll say for that, because I forgot to bring an eagle, you're now a– (eagle sounds)"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I fly away.\nTRAVIS: Away.\nMARISHA: Far, far, away.\nORION: Where are you going?!\nSAM: Tell our story, Keyleth.","response":"DM: That's pretty great."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Then I cry in the corner and rock back and forth a little bit. That's my turn.","response":"DM: I forgot to mention you actually take half damage for the saving throw for the venom so you still would've taken 14 points of poison damage, so mark that."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay.","response":"DM: It is half damage on a save. That brings us to Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I bonus inspire myself?","response":"DM: Because you're Scanlan I'll say, yes. You have such a high opinion of yourself that even you could inspire yourself. So yes, why not."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Not that far.","response":"DM: There."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes. Them I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt at him.","response":"DM: Okay! Straight line that way?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Straight line, that way.","response":"DM: You don't have to roll to hit. You just roll damage on that. I make a saving throw."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh! I didn't even need to inspire.","response":"DM: What's your DC on the spell? Top of your spell list."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17.\nSAM: Thank you.","response":"DM: 17? That's a failure on its saving throw. Go ahead and roll 8d6."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 8d6?! Kill him!","response":"DM: Bards. Gets spells from other classes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: If you kill, I will take a shit on this table.\nSAM: (counting)\nLIAM: It's gone.\nSAM: 24!","response":"DM: 24 points of lightning damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes. (sings a high-pitched note)","response":"DM: How do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"(yelling)\nMARISHA: Wait! Is this the first time you've–\nSAM: I've never killed anything before!\nTRAVIS: Never killed anything in two years!\nLIAM: For the people at home, we live to hear Matt say:\nALL: “How do you want to do this?”","response":"DM: I let the player describe their victory. As you sing to yourself to bolster your arcane energy, you release a shear bolt of energy. How do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: The bolt of lightning begins in its tail and works its way up through its spine, slowly but painfully torturing it as it slowly, slowly feels the effect coursing through its evil body.","response":"DM: Because of your bardic ability to actually shape sound from an arcane standpoint, a lightning bolt should be an instant flash of arcane energy, you actually cause it to crawl. You control it as it begins to cascade up the torso of this horrible abomination. As it does you can see the bolts splinter and destroy each suture wound as each of its heads begins to slough off the rest of the torso until nothing is left but the single head screaming into the air. As the bolt makes its way up the neck, its eyes burst out in a blast of energy. The body falls limp to the ground."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can it have a lightning bolt shaped in an “S?”","response":"DM: A Scanlan-shaped lightning bolt is burned into the torso of the strange naga beast."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well done, Scanlan, well done!","response":"DM: The dust settles, the adrenaline still pumping in your system, Scanlan. All the rest of the dwarves begin stepping down, putting their crossbows down, looking down at the little gnome that created a storm from its hands. One of them pats him on the shoulder and goes, “Well done.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thank you. Just promise me you'll that tell Pike about this.","response":"DM: “Okay?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Because it was really cool, right?","response":"DM: “That was pretty cool.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, good.","response":"DM: All the dwarves look into the tunnel that it came from and the one that you spoke to earlier goes, “So that's the kind of thing that's been coming out of there.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lovely.\nMARISHA: Thanks for the heads up.\nTALIESIN: That was really helpful.","response":"DM: We'll go ahead and leave the game there for the night."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Good job, dude!","response":"DM: Dude, thank you, Zac!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No!","response":"DM: Bears almost got into fights in rings. And eventually the party made their way towards the bottom ring of Kraghammer proper, talking to Lord Nostoc Greyspine, who is--"}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's right, Greyspine.\nSAM: Hi, Scanlan here, hi.","response":"DM: Our resident gnome bard."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, you did!\nORION: Well, of course we have. I'm sorry.","response":"DM: \"I would like to continue this conversation that we had back in my office if you don't mind.\" He turns around and begins to walk back."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh wait, Nostoc. He's not even listening, he's just walking off.\nLAURA: Are you still an eagle? Can you even talk to him?\nTALIESIN: Shouldn't you just go caw?\nMARISHA: Well I'm not an eagle. But I am still poisoned.\nLAURA: Oh, I can help you.\nMARISHA: Oh, that'd be great.\nLAURA: Yeah!\nLAURA: Hold on, I'm gonna go up, and I'm gonna cast--\nSAM: Cast? Yeah, I can cast spells.\nSAM: You can cast?\nLAURA: I can. I've got plenty o' spells.\nLIAM: You can kill?\nLAURA: I'm gonna cast Protection from Poison on Keyleth.","response":"DM: Okay. Essentially go ahead and make a saving throw with advantage. This'll be Constitution."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I made the second one.","response":"DM: What'd you roll?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: A 10. Plus my constitution which is two, three, thirteen.","response":"DM: So thirteen?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes.","response":"DM: That'd be enough. So, after you finish casting the spell, you feel the poison leave the rest of your body. You can kind of take a breath to yourself. The rest of the miners kind of look about and Awkwardly staring back at Nostoc as he walks off, kind of looking back like, what \"Are you gonna go? \"Talk to him?\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah, I guess we should go follow him.\nTALIESIN: We have two very important questions. TRAVIS: Can't we look in the hole a little bit more.\nORION: No Grog, we need to go do this.\nLAURA: We're gonna go in the hole in just a minute, Grog.\nORION: Then you can smash, you'll be fine.\nTRAVIS: You promise?\nLIAM: You did that last night. We need to take care of business. Let's go talk to the man. I'm sure it's going to lead back to the mines.\nMARISHA: To the hole.\nLIAM: Yes, to the hole. Everything's back to the hole.\nSAM: Percy, do you have something to say before we go?\nTALIESIN: Well, this is good. We have to find out what that was, and we have to see if he'll finally give us some of that ale, I think are the two most important things.\nLAURA: It was wine, I believe.\nSAM: No, it was bloody, bloody beer.\nLAURA: Bloodline. Bloody wine, blood wine.\nTRAVIS: Bloodier, ale. Beerwine.","response":"DM: It was delicious is what it was."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It was really good.\nLAURA: Let's go talk to Nostoc.\nSAM: Let's follow him, let's follow him.\nTALIESIN: Okay, this is what's important.\nORION: Sorry, I didn't mean to slam the door like that.","response":"DM: \"A flatulent dragonborn, eh?\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Sir Greyspine. Lord Greyspine? Mr. Greyspine?","response":"DM: \"Lord Greyspine is fine.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Lord Greyspine, yes. Why have you summoned us here? Is it to tell us information about what just came out of your mine, I hope.","response":"DM: \"Well let's be clear.\" \"We dwarves don't need help from outsiders. \"We can handle our own business just fine.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course.\nMARISHA: Speaking of outsiders, you wouldn't happen to have seen a Lady Kima, would you?","response":"DM: \"As what the discussion was based on previously, \"you're searching for her, and last we saw her, She went down into the mine.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We already talked about that, Keyleth.\nTRAVIS: Yep, we did.\nLIAM: They don't like her, she was a troublemaker and she went in.\nTRAVIS: You're an eagle.\nLAURA: She's in the mine. We'll go in and find her. Right? Lord Greyspine?","response":"DM: \"You're welcome to. \"As far as I know, she's down there somewhere. \"Hopefully still in one piece.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: While we're there, would you like us to take care of any other problems?","response":"DM: \"Getting to that. \"You see these small intrusions have been bad \"for meeting our quotas with the Bronzegrip metal warehouse \"and export shipments. \"Employees have been forced to \"collapse a non-negotiable portion of our tunnels \"to prevent incursions like this. \"Without my approval. \"And this is a pattern I wish to stop at once. \"Thus, I have a proposition for you. \"Now, I will give you free reign to our mines. \"I shall get the proper approvals to make sure no Carvers \"bother you as you wander the city's lower ring. \"And I will contract you to delve past our tunnels \"and investigate the source of these creatures, \"where they come from, where they live, \"and if there is some sort of a leader \"who gives them their commands. \"Eliminate them. \"For this, I will reward you with not a trifle sum. \"25,000 gold pieces. \"Plus 250 gold per beast scalp you provide upon returning.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh, I like this.\nORION: Grog, this seems like a wonderful job, doesn't it?\nSAM: Money is wonderful. We like money. But we've been charged to find Lady Kima. We need assurances that we will find her or at least some evidence of her in the mines.","response":"DM: \"The brazen halfling bitch went in there \"without my approval and wandered into the mines, \"not to be seen. \"So if she is down there, I hope she's in one piece. \"I can't guarantee it. \"But if there's any place to find her, that's probably it.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're the group of adventurers for you. I don't know if you've heard of the heroes Emon, who just recently- I'm sure you've heard something. Word travels fast.","response":"DM: \"Not beneath this mountain, it doesn't, of human closers.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We've just done a lot of good to the ruler of Emon.","response":"DM: \"Great. How does that help us dwarves?\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: We're saying we are going to help you, too. And everything will be fine, and we'll all be happy.\nLAURA: Well, we've discovered, in our past adventures, however, is that every realm seems to be having trouble with the same sort of creatures, coming up from the Underdark perhaps?\nLIAM: All we're saying is, help us help you. What exactly have you seen before this day? More of the same? Or other creatures?","response":"DM: He sits back for a second. \"The types of creatures, I do not know. \"I mostly deal with the business \"and just know that there's some bullshite going on \"down in the mines. \"You could ask our foreman, Hieris. \"He's dealt with the cleanup each time \"we've had an incursion like this, \"so if anyone has information on what these creatures are, \"he'd be the one to talk to.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sorry, what was his name again?\nMATT, SAM, LAURA: Hieris.","response":"DM: \"He's a foreman at the mine proper.\""}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I think this seems like the sort of job we'd want to take.\nLAURA, ORION: Yes.\nTRAVIS: Will we get paid for the monsters and creatures we've already slayed?","response":"DM: \"This deal was not sewn in yet, so no.\""}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh.","response":"DM: \"But we thank you for your aid.\" TALIESIN: It is customary in our culture to seal a deal with a drink."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: As I think you are all aware.\nLAURA: Truly, truly.\nLIAM: See, I wasn't just fucking with you last week.\nTALIESIN: And since we are about to risk our lives...\nTRAVIS: I forgot you did that.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes! Happily.\nTRAVIS: Roll good, it's the first one.\nLIAM: Come on, Percy!\nTALIESIN: 14.\nLAURA: Oh.\nSAM: It's pretty good. Not great.","response":"DM: You can see this long, distant, angry, dwarven, mistrusting stare. Rubs his chin, his well-kept, blackened beard and goes, \"Huh, but a sip, as it was a gift.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes!\nLAURA: (whispering) Put some in a bottle.\nORION: We have to save some for those guards.\nLIAM: Let me take care of it. I'll pour everyone a glass.","response":"DM: His nose squints at the sound. (SAM imitates a jaunty flute)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yay.\nLIAM: Okay. That's what we do, right?\nLAURA: Roll well. Here we go. LAURA AND\nLIAM: Oh, no.\nSAM: You have inspiration dice.\nTALIESIN: Inspiration dice are d8?","response":"DM: Yep, you add a d8 to it as well."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, and I can add a d8 to this?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The ale is that good.\nLIAM: Oh good. Now I'm at 19. (Travis groans in relief) Hey.","response":"DM: As you do that, your wineskin goes to full. (imitates liquid sloshing) Swollen to its brim. You switch over to one of the cups, you pass around the drinks. All of you manage to get your drinks passed around."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Huzzah!","response":"DM: \"To a contract!\""}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Aye! Huzzah!\nTALIESIN: To a contract.\nMARISHA: Contracts.\nSAM: L'chaim!\nMARISHA: Love contracts.\nLIAM: Is that Draconian?\nSAM: It's Gnomish.\nTALIESIN: To risking our lives. For money.\nLAURA: How old is Nostoc? Just out of curiosity.","response":"DM: It's hard to tell. Dwarves live quite a long time. He would be equivalent to like a human forties. Dwarven time, somewhere in his mid-hundreds."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Smells like its been in the barrel for a hundred years.\nORION: It has been.\nLAURA: This is excellent.\nLIAM: Tastes like two buck Chuck.\nORION: Oh, I know him from Quimdendale.\nTRAVIS: What do you know of a Ballsac up in the tavern?","response":"DM: \"I'm sorry, what?\""}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do I have that right?\nLAURA: Ball, ball -\nMARISHA: Balgus. GROUP: Balgus.","response":"DM: \"Ah, Balgus, that's the brand of what you brought me.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: You know what, I think we asked about him last time.\nLAURA: I think we did.\nORION: Also, may we take a short rest before we leave this facility?\nMARISHA: Yes, could we do that? Is this considered a short rest?\nLAURA: Oh yeah, that actually would be good.","response":"DM: If you'd like to do that, that would just be taking a short rest outside, probably not in the office proper."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Understandable.","response":"DM: You can leave and just sit down and get some rest."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: When we take a rest, can I look for Hieris?","response":"DM: You can as well. So, while you guys are taking a short rest, you're able to use any of your hit dice to heal up naturally."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We don't naturally heal up?","response":"DM: That is your natural healing. Not to full. It's a continuation, Grog."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I will sing a song of rest. And it goes a little something like, ♫ Scanlan make you feel good ♫ ♫ Scanlan make you feel real good ♫\nORION: Oh, I feel so good.\nSAM: No wait, you get an extra d6 on all your heals.\nTRAVIS: I appreciate the slow jam.","response":"DM: Yeah, on every hit dice, you get an extra d6."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I didn't take any hit points. I'm at full health.","response":"DM: So you got a slow jam just for the sake of the slow jam."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's right. And it was great.\nORION: It feels good. Real good.\nLAURA: Okay. Oh, 25.","response":"DM: A brief discussion with a few of the other wandering dwarf miners that are in the outskirts of the buildings' facilities. Eventually it leads you over to what is a small, secondary building maybe 200 yards off from the main property. That apparently is where Hieris resides and keeps watch over the entire establishment."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I've tagged along.\nLAURA: Knock knock knock.\nSAM: Yeah, we'll go with her.","response":"DM: Why not! Why split the party? So the group makes their way over to the outskirts of the building. Opens up and a very nice, portly looking dwarf with a big tuft of a chinstrap beard. Big reddish, ruddy nose. Leather apron on. And he opens the door. \"Aye, hello! Nice to meet you. What can I do for ye?\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hi. You must be Hieris?","response":"DM: \"I am, I am. Foreman of this here fine mine.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wonderful to meet you. I've heard wonderful things about you.","response":"DM: \"Oh, have you! From who?\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Uh, from Lord Greyspine himself.\nLAURA: We were curious. I'm sure you witnessed all of those wonderful goblins and trolls and other nonsense coming out of the mine.","response":"DM: \"Aye. Nasty lot. It always makes my weeks \"that much more interesting.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Weeks? So this has been happening for quite a while?","response":"DM: \"Unfortunately, at least five or six.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And what kind of monsters have you been dealing with?","response":"DM: \"Terrible kinds.\" He starts rubbing his chin for a little and goes, \"We generally deal with the occasional goblin den \"we stumble across when opening new tunnels. \"That's part of the norm. \"Other nasty underground beasties. \"However, over this past few weeks, \"we've seen some real nightmarish things slither \"out of the shadows. \"Many goblins stitched together, \"like some kind of ball of screaming green lint."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ooh, god.","response":"DM: \"Slimes and oozes that would mutate \"and change color rapidly before seeming to dissolve \"on their own. \"Unstable-looking really, in their form.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sounds more like some type of necromancy magic.","response":"DM: \"Perhaps, but they're not undead, per se. \"They're still alive. \"At least from what we can tell. \"Whatever agony face them in their physical form."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, that's even worse.","response":"DM: \"We even had one brief run-in with what looked \"like a duergar that had swollen and sprouted eyes \"and mouths all across his body. That was a sight.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: What's a duergar?\nLIAM: That's a dark dwarf. They're little fuckers, those are.","response":"DM: \"Aye, duergar.\" And he spits to the side. \"Filthy lost souls. \"Dwarves of old that turned to a darker god. \"Thankfully, they live far beneath the mountains, \"and usually far north enough to not worry about it. \"But one of them found its way up here, \"in this strange, awful, maw-covered form. \"It was terrifying. \"And the smell! \"Oh ho ho! \"Anyway, we've even seen a few creatures from the surface \"that normally aren't found down here as well, \"which is strange. \"They don't wander down. \"Something's bringing them. \"Weirdest thing.\" \"Oh! And I just heard we had some weird, many-headed serpent thing that just got killed down there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, we just killed one of those.","response":"DM: \"That was you!\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes!\nTRAVIS: Our hero is right over here.\nSAM: (clears throat) Hi.","response":"DM: And he steps onto his back leg, shifting his weight, and cocks an awkward eyebrow. \"Really?\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm really strong for my age.\nORION: We were all surprised.\nTALIESIN: We're as surprised as anybody.\nTRAVIS: Fearsome Scanlan.\nSAM: Actually, Hieris, I have a question for you. You know the mines very well, yes?","response":"DM: \"Aye, I do.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Far from asking you to draw us a map, are there any tunnels or directions that we should avoid or particularly head towards? Anything that we should look for in terms of traps or tricks?","response":"DM: \"Not within our mines. \"They're usually well-guarded. Or, they were.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Also, do you have a map?","response":"DM: \"Of the mines? \"Yeah, I do.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wonderful.","response":"DM: He starts going through his notes here."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'll take that.\nSAM: That's where we're going, right?\nTRAVIS: We're goin' in the hole.","response":"DM: It's kinda haphazardly scrawled across a piece of parchment, but he hands it over to you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is there a particular area on that map that most of the baddies seem to be coming from?","response":"DM: \"No, we've closed it off each time.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Just kind of everywhere?","response":"DM: \"Oh no, we've had a few tunnels they've come through, \"but we've managed to collapse those \"and make sure they're not coming through again."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And we noticed the, I believed it was the naga we fought, it seemed to have several extra heads stitched on. Have you no knowledge of these creatures? It seems very odd. Is there any connection in dwarven history or past? Or this is totally out of the blue?","response":"DM: \"No no, not to my knowledge, at least. \"I mean, most beasts we find are in one piece, \"not several together. \"It's a bit disturbing to be honest. \"I told my nephew about it and he was crying for hours.\" LAURA and"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh.\nTRAVIS: Do any of the beasts go back into them?","response":"DM: \"Oh no, we've killed them as they come out each time.\" Right, they don't take anything back."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hieris, do you know if there's any other entrances into the mine? Any old secret tunnels, something that someone could be using to get in?","response":"DM: \"Not to the mine, this is all proprietary. \"This is the business we run, so we don't have any internal \"or secret entrances. \"That would leave us open to a sort of a thief to come in and steal our mithril.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And what's security like on the mine? Is there any chance someone could've slipped in through Kraghammer without you knowing, or is that all locked up?","response":"DM: \"Oh, I highly doubt that, not with \"the way our carvers are trained.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Understood, understood.\nLAURA: They are quite--","response":"DM: \"That's what I'm talking about."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: \"Fine dwarven study.\""}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Before we go--\nLAURA: Strong ale.","response":"DM: \"Finest of military classes, aye. \"Proud of 'em.\""}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Cool! Hey, it's a house.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Good.","response":"DM: As you look about, it's hard to tell the nature. This looks just like a lawn with a well-framed stone exterior."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Cool.","response":"DM: But there's no fence. There's nothing keeping you from walking into the lawn and towards the building."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see what light source is making all this grass grow, or if it's like magical growing?","response":"DM: No nature check required. There is no light source, other than the green rocks that generally permeate the interior of Kraghammer to give its kind of strange luminescent atmosphere. This kind of dull red glow that's around the entire city. Other than a couple of sparks of lantern light. There's no light source."}

So I go out.\nLAURA: Oh, and you're with me. Let's both fly to the door.\nLIAM: I have nine healing potions--\nSAM: Hey, hold on, hold on.\nTRAVIS: What what, you turned invisible and walked inside a house last time.\nSAM: Yeah, I can do whatever we want. Do you want me to knock on the door, is that what we're trying to do?\nLAURA: Oh yeah, use your--\nSAM: Okay, so yes. I send an unseen servant to knock on the door.\nTRAVIS: What kind, like a buddy?\nLAURA: Oh, he tried it before.","response":"DM: Where do you create the unseen servant?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Where do I create it?","response":"DM: Yeah."}

{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, the ghost.\nSAM: Hello!\nORION: I'm waving. Hello.","response":"DM: Opens the door, comes out. You now see this dwarven figure hunched, very, very old, with a long, very, very well-crafted brass staff, looks like a black or purple gem at the top. Spectacles at the tip of its nose.

You can see the actual track of the minetrack leading around. You come upon a couple of dwarves that look over their shoulders begrudgingly at you guys as you pass going, \"Hey? Eh, shh,\" and go right back into mining whatever remains in the inside of this. It looks like this portion of the mine has been nearly picked clean. The dwarves that are in there are probably just wasting time to get their pay for the day. You go further back and eventually it opens up. I think I have the map available."}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's a boot.\nMARISHA: It's the boot, yeah.","response":"DM: Following it, you get to a portion of the mine that is very busy. You can see, since this is probably one of the portions that wasn't collapsed in previous incursions buy whatever creatures these were, you get the feeling that this one has basically taken most of their workforce to try and find and carve a new vein. Or find a new path to pull things from. You get towards the portion where all these dwarves are working, and you notice that some of the doors have been shattered, knocked off the hinges. You imagine whatever creatures were barreling through before, this is probably where they came through."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: A natural one. Vax and I get dressed up in Sherlock Holmes cosplay, and we say, \"Golly gee, I think I see some animal tracks \"over here.\"\nTALIESIN: They are staring at their own footprints on the ground.\nMARISHA: \"The trail's going cold!\"\nTALIESIN: Following around in a circle.","response":"DM: Oh man, this has turned completely back from the first game. You guys are failing consistently."}

{"prompt":"LIAM: Anyhow, I've got a map, so let's use this. Stay on point here.\nLIAM: I've seen enough. We should keep going.\nLAURA: That goes down.\nLIAM: That goes down.

And part of the ceiling has collapsed. You can see that there were portions where the mine expanded much deeper into the mountain that were detonated or collapsed in the idea of preventing any further incursion by whatever these creatures are pouring through. You also can see that there are some dwarven corpses being loaded out from the mine below, as well as goblin corpses, individuals that were caught in the attack that happened yesterday before it managed to emerge from the mine."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should follow those.\nSAM: Any goblin corpse is a good goblin, I say. I'm fine with it. I'll just quickly spit on their bodies as they go by.","response":"DM: And you do so quite quickly (spits). It's rapid, it's amazing."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So we follow the corpses and see where they're coming from.\nSAM: No no no, no no no. That's being taken to be buried, let's just keep--\nLAURA: No no no, where they're coming from.\nSAM: Oh.\nLIAM: So we could either go to the rear of the mine on this level and see where they're coming from.\nLAURA: I thought we already went downstairs?\nLIAM: No, not yet.","response":"DM: There's a spiral staircase on the map. On the lower right hand side."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes, I see it.","response":"DM: That's where they're coming from."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does that lead down probably?","response":"DM: It seems to."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well then let's take the elevator, whatever. Let's go down.\nTRAVIS: You should put it under the thing.\nTALIESIN: We're good with down.","response":"DM: You guys go ahead and approach the elevator. It's a large wooden platform with a series of chains. My terrible, hastily drawn map there for you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's kinda crap, but it's kinda great.","response":"DM: Yeah, I know. It was actually more designed as a DM utensil, but you guys needed a map--"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I love it.","response":"DM: --so I gave you my map."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: There you go.\nLAURA: Take it back.","response":"DM: So I'm taking it back."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Give it to me.","response":"DM: \"Okay, step on the platform.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Let's do it. The two dwarves grab and begin to rotate the giant wheel, as it does you here the winch and the chain begin to tighten as it does. The platform shudders for a second, begins to lower. As it begins to lower, you can feel the actual platform shake a little bit as the whole weight is placed on the chains.\nTALIESIN: Guys. We're on an elevator.\nMARISHA: This is scary.\nORION: I love elevators.","response":"DM: As the winch begins to release, it--"}

She's never been in this tight of a space.\nTRAVIS: Are you claustrophobic?","response":"DM: As the light spell bursts out from his staff. You all kind of have to cover your eyes for a second. But the lower area is opened up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Word of warning, Tiberius.\nLAURA: Can we see out?\nORION: She said it was dark, and then I cast my spell.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, it's what you do.","response":"DM: (imitates loud thudding) You guys hit the bottom floor. You step off the platform, and you can see there is a secondary minecart that leads from this elevator that curves to the left and leads deeper into the mine proper. To the right of you is the spiral staircase. And you can see now two of the other miner dwarves are dragging a dead body across."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I look for goblin tracks down here and follow those?\nSAM: Why don't we just ask the dwarves where they were getting the bodies?\nTRAVIS: You're gonna roll crap. You're gonna roll crap.\nLAURA: Don't curse me.\nMARISHA: Please don't do that.\nLAURA: What am I, what is it? That I add it to?","response":"DM: Investigate."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Perception?","response":"DM: Investigate. But you advantage on the roll, because you're a ranger, tracking."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh sweet. Okay.\nSAM: Why don't we just ask?\nLAURA: Well that's good, okay. Let's go with a 17.","response":"DM: 17, alright. So as you guys are going to ask somebody about this, your ranger gets down and begins inspecting the floor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, I see things!","response":"DM: Where you can see there were struggles that apparently occurred. You can see slash marks on the ground. You can see bodies, or the impacts of bodies where some of these dwarves have been pulled away. A few minutes later, you can see tracks, dwarven tracks, of bodies being pulled and dragged, not in the direction they're going, but further down the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go there.\nLAURA: Oh, no.","response":"DM: As you look and follow that track, you notice that maybe a good 200 feet to the left of the cavern, there is a new tunnel breach that is currently open. About a 20 by 15 size tunnel that is fresh and blasted out from the other side. You can see rubble and rocks strewn across the floor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I hear, I hear birds coming from the--\nTRAVIS: It's a fucking trip, right?\nLAURA: I know.\nSAM: Let's go down there. Let's go down where it's dangerous.\nLAURA: Can we see?\nTRAVIS: Can we ask one of the guards?\nTALIESIN: It's a mine canary.\nLIAM: Is it black or is it dim?","response":"DM: With his light spell, it's fairly bright."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Nice!","response":"DM: Otherwise, it's fairly dim."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Why would you do that?\nTRAVIS: Why not?","response":"DM: (faintly) Grog-Grog. Grog. Following the tracks, you can see the dragging of the bodies does indeed go in the direction, and into the newly carved tunnel. In this mine network."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Big, small?","response":"DM: Most of them are also dwarven in shape."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, okay.\nMARISHA: Most of them.","response":"DM: So, there are, you can gather, dwarven feet dragging dwarven bodies deeper inside."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Duergar.\nLAURA: Dwarven centipede.\nLIAM: It's the duergar.","response":"DM: However, there are two bodies that are being dragged with no footprints whatsoever."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What?\nLAURA: Wings.\nSAM: They're being used like skateboards.\nMARISHA: Legolas style.\nORION: Who and what are those?\nLIAM: This is 2015.\nTRAVIS: Is there any residue?\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nSAM: Wow, if only we had asked some dwarves what's been going on down here.\nLAURA: Is there any residue, blood?\nORION: We already know.\nLAURA: Green, red, black.","response":"DM: From the dragging marks, there is no blood. There's no signs of them dragging dead bodies off, at least."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does it look like they struggled?","response":"DM: No, there's no struggle either."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh crap, fire.\nMARISHA: What about the walls? How close are the walls?","response":"DM: The walls here for this tunnel are about 15, 20 feet in width. And about 10, 15 feet high."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Are there any scratch marks or anything like that on the walls?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Let's stop dicking around and go into that mine. TRAVIS,\nTALIESIN: Yeah.\nLAURA: Might as well.\nTRAVIS: We go further.","response":"DM: You push further in. (Liam imitates sword being drawn)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should've grabbed some dried fruit.\nTRAVIS: We got a ton.","response":"DM: Steadily declining and winding as it progresses. Three hours go by. This tunnel goes extremely deep. Whatever managed to dig its way up here came from pretty far under this mine."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: At no point does it look like the bodies ever moved?","response":"DM: Nope, no change in physicality. No sign of struggle."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But there are the drag marks all the way?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And two hours ago, I started stealthing and taking the lead. When we're in the dark.\nLAURA: I thought I was tracking.\nLIAM: Uh, 29.\nLAURA: Whoo, that's a good roll. Yay, first good roll of the night.\nLAURA: Changing it around.\nTRAVIS: Let me touch you.","response":"DM: You feel pretty stealthy. You guys look like, wait, where the hell did Vax go?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh shit, I hope he didn't hear me just say that about him. Dammit.\nLAURA: Oh thank you, brother.\nTALIESIN: I'm having a serious Tom Sawyer island vibe.\nLAURA: I found him.\nLIAM: Looks fine.","response":"DM: About four hours--"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Are there any drafts? Do I feel any wind flows or anything like that?","response":"DM: No. It is still. It is stagnant air. (Laura coughs) Even more stagnant now. Four hours of traveling deeper into this tunnel's path until--"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Anybody else have to go to the bathroom?\nTRAVIS: He rolled, he rolled something.\nLAURA: Oh no, he rolled.\nMARISHA: And so, that is how I spent my 12th birthday.\nSAM: Great story, Keyleth. And, yeah.\nMARISHA: Let's see, what else.\nTRAVIS: Hey Scanlan, you kill me, I kill you.\nLIAM: There a great little cave alcove here, perfect for peeing in.\nLAURA: Oh brother, good to see you.\nLIAM: For everyone to pee.\nLAURA: Am I over here, or am I over here? Perhaps we could take a pee break here and proceed further into the mines.\nMARISHA: I agree with that.\nLAURA: That's a good idea.\nLIAM: Do you catch my drift?","response":"DM: As the four hour mark of travel into this tunnel presents itself, the tunnel finally widens and opens. As the sound of distant water rushing reaches your ears."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no, I have to go to the bathroom.","response":"DM: As Tiberius steps into this opening, the light cascades into this new cavern. A large, beautiful open space presents itself, a good 100-foot-up ceiling. From what you can see, a roaring river is now pouring out of the nearby rock, cascading over a cliffside into a waterfall down into this deeper, giant cavernous space."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What about the tracks?","response":"DM: The tracks continue in the direction of that river."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Into the river? Like it goes into the water?\nLAURA: Do we want to step into the room fully?\nMARISHA: Why don't we send--\nLAURA: I'm gonna stealth. I'm gonna stealth, too.\nMARISHA: Stealth twins.\nORION: Do I detect any magic? Stealth twins, 2015.","response":"DM: You detect no magic. You roll stealth."}

{"prompt":"LIAM: 18.","response":"DM: 18?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: You hear a very, very faint sound in the distance. (sharp noise)"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Did you hear that?","response":"DM: That's not the sound. Tiberius."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm sorry.\nLAURA: I have a passive perception of 21.","response":"DM: Yes you do. You hear a: (clicks tongue quickly)"}

{"prompt":"LIAM: I might hear spiders.\nMARISHA: Oh.\nLAURA: Ugh.\nTRAVIS: Or crab.\nLIAM: Or something.\nMARISHA: Making it old school.\nSAM: Maybe it's a very faint maraca dance of some sort.\nLAURA: What direction is it coming from?\nTRAVIS: That would be better.","response":"DM: It's hard to tell at this point, it seems to be just kind of loosely atmospheric."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is the light coming from over the water?","response":"DM: The very, very faint light you see, no. It's adjacent to the water to the right of you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay.\nLIAM: I think we're dealing with spiders.","response":"DM: (continues clicking)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think you guys should hang back, and we should stealth over and see how many it looks like we're dealing with.\nLIAM: The twins will creep forward.","response":"DM: Okay. You both creep forward."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket stays with the group. Trinket, stay with Grog.\nORION: I'm gonna dispel my light spell.","response":"DM: Pitch darkness falls upon all of you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What did you do that for?\nSAM: Because now they don't know where we are.\nLAURA: But we can't see anything.\nTRAVIS: They're spiders.\nMARISHA: While he does that, I'm gonna go ahead and turn into a cave bear.\nORION: Can you not see now?\nLAURA: We can see in dim light.\nMARISHA: Cave bears have darkvision.\nMARISHA: I'm pretty sure.\nLIAM: No, dim light only.","response":"DM: Do they?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What'd you turn into?\nORION: It doesn't matter, do you want me to turn it back on?\nTALIESIN: A cave bear.\nMARISHA: Yeah, subterranean bears, they have darkvision.\nSAM: He can just make light again.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Turn it back on.\nMARISHA: No, leave it off!\nORION: I dispel it again, I'm sorry.\nMARISHA: Fuck! Fuck!","response":"DM: Light, light light, light light."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How did you do that?\nMARISHA: It's been a bad night.\nLAURA: Oh no.\nMARISHA: 12 total.\nLIAM: Clap on (claps), clap off. (claps)","response":"DM: As you glance about in cave bear form, you look up and all you can make out is shifting movement across the ceiling."}
{"prompt":"(group groans at once)","response":"DM: But it's large. It's not a small creature. You glance off to your left and you look up and you see a second one."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.\nTRAVIS: Oh fuck.","response":"DM: And both dislodge."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: All of you hear two loud, cacophonous, thunderous slam sounds-- (imitates loud thudding)"}

{"prompt":"LIAM: Thank you, Matt, for doing all the work on these maps and shit.","response":"DM: That's what I do. So there's the water there, rushing off into the waterfall that goes further down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I stealth against the other wall?\nTRAVIS: Waterfall is where on that map?","response":"DM: The waterfall is right here."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Got it.","response":"DM: So the river kind of pours over, falls into the water below. There are some of these large rock elements here."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What are they?","response":"DM: You cannot tell what's beyond this area, which is where the light source is coming from. (imitates thudding)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!\n(group groans) (imitates thudding)\nTRAVIS: Those look like umber hulks.","response":"DM: They are."}
{"prompt":"(group screams) You've had one brief run-in with a single umber hulk in the past.\nLAURA: Now we have two.

You don't have that much time, unfortunately. Because they are upon you, it a surprise round.\nTRAVIS: Shit!\nLAURA: Do they respond to vibration? I forget.\nTRAVIS: They responded to something.","response":"DM: They respond to the something."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we remember with investigation or insight?\nLIAM: Limericks, limericks, they respond to limericks.","response":"DM: So this one shifts up over there, and this one moves up to there. Gleans past you, as it does not notice you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, but it's still big.","response":"DM: This one comes towards you, Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Damn it.","response":"DM: Attacking you with each of its claws and its mandibles. The first strike comes at you with a 13 to hit with its first claw. What's your AC?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ah, 17.","response":"DM: You, woomf, just manage to dodge out of the way as these giant-bladed claws sweep next to your face. The second strike comes to you at a 21."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh shit. That hits.\nTALIESIN: That hits. I'm going to use a gunslinger's dodge.\nLAURA: Gunslinger's dodge.\nTALIESIN: Wait, let's see if I can do this. It's not enough, nevermind, so no. I just gotta take it.\nTALIESIN: Oh, okay.","response":"DM: And just as you pull back the mandibles, time to crunch down upon you. And that is going to be a 27 to hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, no.\nTRAVIS: Do their eyes do something?","response":"DM: You take 14 points of slashing damage, as the mandibles slice down, clamping onto your shoulder. You manage to pull free, but in doing so, you wrench the pointed portions of the mandible across your shoulder, pulling open the flesh in this horrible jagged pattern."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ow.","response":"DM: That brings us to the other one, who is attacking Grog."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Grog! You're right there in front of it. The biggest and most viable visual it can find.\nSAM: d8?","response":"DM: d8."}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That hits.","response":"DM: And a 14."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Misses.","response":"DM: Okay, then from the one claw that gets you, you take six points of slashing damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay.\n(group groans)\nLAURA: I'm so scared to roll.\nMARISHA: I know, it's been so bad.\nSAM: Best one of I've had.\nTALIESIN: Ah, not horrible.\nLAURA: Oh, good.\nTRAVIS: Ball sack.\nMARISHA: Uh, it's okay.\nLAURA: 24.","response":"DM: 24."}

{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, shit!","response":"DM: As you're going to reach back, you look over into its strange, glistening, black, dead, insect-like eyes of the umber hulk, and you feel this strange wave of mental confusion hit your head. Go ahead and make a--"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I knew it.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a saving throw. This is going to be charisma saving throw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is this what confused you and had you running out the door?\nTRAVIS: I fell out a fucking 120 foot hole.","response":"DM: So you roll d20, add your charisma saving throw at the top of your character."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: 13.\n(group groans) We're gonna go ahead and find out what happens. (Laura groans)\nTRAVIS: Maybe he'll ask you to make some cookies.\nLAURA: You're gonna have me do nothing wrong?","response":"DM: You reach for it, and you space out for a second. Your hands fall to your side. And you stand there."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Aw, fuck.","response":"DM: Trinket is looking for some sort of cue from you of what to do."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does he look confused too?","response":"DM: No, but Trinket's looking to you for some sort of direction and is getting none. This is a very clustered space, too. Can barely see you over this."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But I was stealthed, though.\nSAM: Don't worry, I'll help you my dear.","response":"DM: I know. Doesn't matter if you're stealthed. He couldn't see you, but you could see him."}

{"prompt":"SAM: It did not work.","response":"DM: Doesn't seem to be having an effect unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. And then as my bonus action, who got hit first? You did? I'll just throw a healing word to him.","response":"DM: Okay. Just go ahead and roll, feeling him. That's a d4 plus five. Yeah, you got it. Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Mm.","response":"DM: You heal--"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What is this?","response":"DM: It's a four."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, that's a four. Okay.","response":"DM: So you heal nine hit points, and it's your turn. What do you got, Percy?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Up to 58, let me just fix that, there we go. Okay, where am I on the board?","response":"DM: You are right here in front--"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, so there's no getting away. I'm gonna-- I can basically without-- I remember I'm not supposed to look at these things. I know where this thing is. I can pull my gun and just take a shot, right?","response":"DM: So averting your gaze, you take a shot. You are at disadvantage on the attack roll."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How much?","response":"DM: Just disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm just disadvantage?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well okay, that's fine. I'm gonna spend a grit point for a deadshot, so I'm gonna get a plus one to hit.\nTRAVIS: Come on, Perce.\nTALIESIN: Aha! That will be a-- with the plus one, that's a 28, 29, 30 to hit.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Get after it, nasty!","response":"DM: Roll again, as you have disadvantage. Because you're not looking at it directly."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh, please be good.\nTALIESIN: That's still 25 to hit.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 26, actually.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And then I get extra damage because I did deadshot. So that's plus one, so that will be a-- it's a 2d8 plus five plus ice, because I'm hitting with my ice shot. And that's seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. 14 points of ice damage.","response":"DM: 14 points of ice damage. Nice."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: We're all gonna die. You spin the barrel, go back to go ahead and fire again, as you do (imitates gun clicking) You pull the trigger for a second, and you feel a slight (imitates fizzled explosion) inside the barrel.\nTRAVIS: Damn it!\nMARISHA: Oh, no.","response":"DM: And you feel the actual metal get extremely cold, and you have you have to shake it out like, aw, damn it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Since I can't move, I'm gonna-- my movement, my minor is gonna be just fixing my-- yeah, so.","response":"DM: Okay, so your action is just trying to fix the gun?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: Damn.","response":"DM: Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Keyleth, don't look at them.\nMARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: Just as a note, your inspiration dice that you give can be used on saving throws as well."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. But I haven't given any.","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Um, I'm a bear right now.","response":"DM: You are a bear, which I will, for the sake of this, give you the kitty."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Maybe.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No?","response":"DM: So fog cloud. The entire space, it's a 20 foot radius? I believe, if I recall from the one he did yesterday."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But it screws our vision, though, doesn't it?\nLAURA: Well, yeah.","response":"DM: Everybody gets obscured vision."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But I mean, we wouldn't be able to see them. Would it help with the confusion is what I'm hoping.\nLAURA: That could help, that could help.\nSAM: Do your thing. Do what you do.\nMARISHA: Or would it be bad?\nLAURA: Try it. Do it, Keyleth, go with your instincts.\nTALIESIN: Don't think about what's the worst that could possibly happen.\nMARISHA: I'm bursting out a fog cloud, and then--","response":"DM: Well to cast, you have to get out of creature form, remember?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, that's right. I didn't throw a bow.","response":"DM: So you're a bear."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm a cave bear, I'm blind. I'm like a blind fish. I have darkvision and, like, cataracts.","response":"DM: Darkvision means you can see in the dark."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well I'm a bear.","response":"DM: You are a bear. I'm eating at his leg. I'm not looking at his eyes. I'm not, like, waxing poetically at how sexy he is."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Not whispering sweet nothings in his ear.","response":"DM: I know."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm gnawing at his leg.","response":"DM: That's true."}

You can feel the oppression of the umber hulk's gaze, but you shrug it off, your bear mind not affected by the measly tricks and traits--"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Urgh, I'm a bear!","response":"DM: -of these strange underground entities."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Now I'm attacking.","response":"DM: Roll for your four attacks."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: First one probably misses. With my claw, 14.","response":"DM: 14 misses."}
{"prompt":"ORION: She got a pizza.\nMARISHA: With the claw attacks, do I have two claw attacks, do I roll for both?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, so the first one is 19,","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Second one, second claw attack is 18.","response":"DM: Also hits."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. So I am doing 2d6 plus five twice. So six plus--\nTALIESIN: It's 11.\nMARISHA: Five, so 11.\nTALIESIN: Ooh.\nMARISHA: Plus 17-- 20 damage.","response":"DM: 20 damage. Nice."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 25.\nMARISHA: Oh, 25. Sorry, 25.\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nMARISHA: 25 damage.","response":"DM: So, as you shake off the effect, you reach for it, lashing out, two large strikes. The second one gets a distinct carve into the back of the umber hulk's hide. You can see a portion of its chitinous back armor gets kind of pulled off in a chunk. And it (snarls), reels back from the impact and readies itself for a second round of attacks."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Me and Trinket.","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Bear style.","response":"DM: They go. This one turns towards and moves this way to focus on the cave bear that just thrashed against its hide.

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hits.","response":"DM: That's mandibles. 17 to hit with its claw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hits.","response":"DM: And 18 to hit with its claw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hits.\nMARISHA: What was the last one?","response":"DM: The last one was 15. Just unleashes an array of strikes against you. (Matt growls)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hit it in the face.","response":"DM: That brings us to the other one who's attacking you, Grog."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Back at him, yeah.","response":"DM: That is a 12 to hit. Pretty sure misses."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Misses.","response":"DM: Another 12 to hit, 'cause it likes to roll fours, apparently."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Give me another four.","response":"DM: For the mandibles, it's a 20."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 20 hits.","response":"DM: You're taking damage, fool. That is 18 points of slashing damage against you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I have a half damage to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage?","response":"DM: You haven't raged yet."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So I'm not raging?!","response":"DM: You haven't raged yet! It isn't your turn yet."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: But I'm so angry.","response":"DM: I know. You're about to be so angry."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 18 points.","response":"DM: You're gonna be so angry. 18 points of slashing damage. The mandibles crush down on your body, and you can feel them pierce into your chest.

{"prompt":"LAURA: That's brutal.\nTRAVIS: My turn's coming.","response":"DM: That ends their turn. Vax."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I can see what's up. I saw what it did to my sister, so I'm gonna jump on its back. I'm gonna swivel my daggers around and just stab it in the face.\nLAURA: But keep your gaze averted.\nLIAM: Yeah, I'm seeing the back of his fucking spine or head. I'm gonna stab him in the face twice.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.\nLIAM: Nine-- 20.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. So then I'll do damage. The other one's an 18. I rolled in advance.\nLAURA: That counts, that counts!","response":"DM: That one, that's the one!"}

As you do, you put the blade back into your belt, grab with your other hand, pull your other dagger, and slam it into the other side of its head."}

You should be a rhinoceros.\nTALIESIN: We're just waiting for you to scream, \"It's morphin time!\" It's morphing time! Bear!\nMARISHA: Oh my god, can you make me smoke bombs that smoke, and I say, \"It's morphin time\"?","response":"DM: So you can make a grapple attempt in place of one of your attacks."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh. I don't have stats, I'm a bear.","response":"DM: No, you use the bear's stats."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But all I have are the basic six.","response":"DM: Right, what's the strength?"}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god, you're doing it, Keyleth.\nMARISHA: Pulling him underwater.\nLIAM: It's a waterfall, oh.","response":"DM: (imitates thudding) You both plunge underneath the water's surface. Take a big old breath right beforehand, and I'm going underwater."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wait, can you let him go and let him drown?\nLAURA: Yeah, let him go, 'cause it's a waterfall.\nMARISHA: No, I'm holding on to him.\nLAURA: But Keyleth, there's a waterfall. It's fine.","response":"DM: It's now its turn. It's going to try and break your grapple."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Against his strength, I guess. Ah, 20.","response":"DM: 20, okay. You maintain your grip on the umber hulk. It's thrashing in the water trying to get its way to the surface. (snarls) Still slashing about. So it's gonna make its attacks against you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hits.","response":"DM: 14 hits you?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm a bear, my armor class is 12 right now.","response":"DM: Well no, you keep your armor class."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: So it hits.\nMARISHA: It's okay guys.","response":"DM: Total of 26 points of slashing damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I am no longer a bear.","response":"DM: So you lose your grip as your form reverts. You are now back to Keyleth's form in the water."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And you're in the water!\nMARISHA: Can I cast a concentration spell on myself?","response":"DM: No, because you used your actions to grapple it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And that's it.","response":"DM: So you're now just back in the Keyleth form, underwater. You catch your breath and realize you're now underwater in near darkness with an umber hulk right on you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hey brah. Sup? Fancy meeting you here.","response":"DM: Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so first thing I do is lean down and pick up the snail off the ground and say, \"Hey, um, go fuck yourself.\" And then I throw him into the waterfall.\nSAM: Oh Jesus!","response":"DM: Over here?"}

{"prompt":"SAM: Hey! Bye-bye!\nLIAM: Now, that seems like a bonus action to me, right?","response":"DM: That's an attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So then that's an attack, okay.","response":"DM: It's the world's easiest grapple throw."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You threw him forever.\nLIAM: Then I'm good.\nLAURA: That's it?\nLIAM: Well, that's my action, right?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I only have one.\nSAM: You can move, you can move.","response":"DM: Make an acrobatics check, try to tumble through them."}

{"prompt":"LIAM: Right up behind shitface there. And do I have anything left? Or do I just get there and stop.","response":"DM: Well, it was the attack to throw it. You would have your second off-hand."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Second attack. Well let's stab him in the ass then, right.","response":"DM: Well, you have disadvantage 'cause it's currently in the water thrashing about, and it's hard to see. Well, that's not very good. 15."}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Good.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll damage, Grog. As you come charging forward, just (grunts), leaving bits of foam cascading off the side of your mouth. Your eyes just glazed over with white. You bring the axe down into the water, form towards where the splashing is. Keeping mindful that Keyleth might be in there somewhere. But you're very much see the larger form in the field, so."}

What do we need to do?\nMARISHA: We'll figure that out when we kill this guy, I guess.\nLAURA: Restoration?\nLIAM: Can you dispel that shit?\nSAM: I tried, I tried.\nMARISHA: He can't dispel it, It's not magic. But I might be able to cure him afterwards.\nLIAM: Tiberius, can you dispel that shit?\nORION: It's the same spell.\nLAURA: It's a restoration spell, it's not a dispel.\nMARISHA: I might be able to.\nORION: So, the guy knocked down over there is-- let me see that pointer. This guy, that's the one that we knocked out with the arrow?\nTALIESIN: Yeah, that's the dead one.\nORION: The dead one or the one we knocked out?\nTALIESIN: He's dead.\nORION: Who do we have incapacitated?\nTALIESIN: That's the one we shot.\nMARISHA: That's the one Liam has.\nLAURA: Let one live.\nORION: And the one right here is...?\nLIAM: The one by me is weak.","response":"DM: Both of them are pretty weak right now, actually."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: And I ask Scanlan to dispel the stank cloud.\nTALIESIN: Dispel the stank.\nLAURA: And I yell-- Can I yell out \"surrender\" in Undercommon?","response":"DM: You yell out, (speaks angry gibberish)!"}

We'll be back next week, Thursday at 7:00. I know the schedule said seven to nine. We usually run a little later. Because D&D and why not?"}

{"prompt":"ALL: Bye!","response":"DM: Hey, everyone. Sorry about that little issue there. But thank you for your patience. I appreciate that. Going back over what had transpired previously. So the party was hired to go into Kraghammer seeking Lady Kima of Vord, who is a renowned folk hero, a halfling paladin of much renown, following Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon of justice and good, who went on a vision quest, apparently seeing some sort of evil brewing beneath Kraghammer, and went on her own to seek it and destroy it. Hasn't been seen for many weeks– months, even – since. And so the party has then gone into Kraghammer to attempt to locate her. After some conversing, some brawling, some interesting circumstances, they found information that she disappeared into the Mithril mines just underneath the lower circle of Kraghammer. They've since battled a few creatures, apparently these strange monstrosities are coming out of the mines recently. And they've had dwarven miners being taken and disappearing. They charged into the mines, found one of the series of tunnels that had broken into the mines from some other source, encountered a few umber hulks, were ambushed by some duergar, which are subterranean, dark, ashen grey–"}

{"prompt":"LIAM: Found the troll dick!\nLAURA: Ohh.","response":"DM: Looking over him, and there's very little physical damage to him. He shrugs it off pretty easily. There's no notable sign or anything other than the fact that his eyes aren't reacting to anything. It looks like he is catatonic."}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to go take a look at the remnants of the brain creature.\nLAURA: Ew.","response":"DM: And it's much larger than any natural brain should be. It's probably– When it was all in one piece, it would have been roughly about the size of a small dog."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do any of us know anything about magic that could heal him? Like any spells.","response":"DM: Do you?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I mean–\nMARISHA: I think I might–\nORION: It's clear that when that brain thing hit Grog with his zapper thing, that it rendered him unconscious.

I know Pike isn't here, but–\nMARISHA: I–\nORION: You have something, don't you?\nMARISHA: I think I have a spell. That might be able to help. I don't know it right now though. We'd have to take a break. I'd have to pull out my books and relearn it. It takes some time.\nLIAM: How much time do you need?\nMARISHA: Need to sleep on it.\nLAURA: How– Can we–\nTRAVIS: As they talk, Grog slowly flatulates.\nTRAVIS: (fart sound)\nSAM: It happens, it's natural.","response":"DM: It's terrible."}

{"prompt":"SAM: Poo. Poo cloud.\nLAURA: Lovely.\nLIAM: Everybody make a constitution saving throw.\nLAURA: Yeah, a constitution saving–\nORION: How many entrances– How many ways or edges where we are? Because it's like at the center, anyway–","response":"DM: Yeah, you're currently basically on the precipice of a large cavern that has multiple layers as the river kind of cascades off into multiple waterfalls. As far as you can see– which isn't far good because there's no other light source beyond you guys– the cavern just continues indefinitely for a good 60 feet and then just vanishes into darkness."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, maybe we should sleep. Try to camp\nfor the time–\nSAM: Well, we'll need to form a perimeter and someone will have to stand guard–","response":"DM: Well, currently you're holding a barely alive duergar hostage."}

{"prompt":"LIAM: Hers.","response":"DM: You speak Undercommon."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hers.","response":"DM: First thing you note, too: it is female, and it takes a moment to register that because she is also bald on top."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It. Terrible.\nLAURA: Sorry.","response":"DM: Nasty, pale, kind of sunken face. Eyes are completely clouded over and white, no pupils. Teeth are kind of yellow and gnarled and sharp."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't kill her. I need her.\nLIAM: She's not unconscious, right?","response":"DM: No."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: What did the brain work do to our friend?\nMARISHA: Brain twerk?","response":"DM: “Took care of your friend. He's gone now. He's all dead inside. Kaputski.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What are you here for?","response":"DM: “Just creating a mess.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What should I fucking ask her? I say that in our language, not–\nLAURA: What should I ask?\nTALIESIN: How do we fix it?\nLAURA: How do we– (lowers voice) How do we fix it?\nTALIESIN: There you go.","response":"DM: “Bury your dead weight.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I press the blade a little tighter.","response":"DM: “Ugh! Gah!”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Dig in. Maybe one hit point worth of–\nLAURA: No, no! She's only got one hit point left.\nLIAM: She's only got one?","response":"DM: She's got one hit point."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't do that!\nTALIESIN: Is she bleeding?","response":"DM: Profusely. From the shoulder."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh! In that case, I'm going to cauterize the wounds. There's more than one way to make someone talk!\nLAURA: Ugh.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to shoot my gun off– get it nice and hot right at the tip and start cauterizing the wounds.","response":"DM: Okay so (gunshot). And the flash goes off. The sound of blast echoes throughout the entirety of the cavern. You can hear (echoing gunshot) cascade off."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: A little warning next time!","response":"DM: He takes the barrel, slams it into the shoulder and the sizzling sound as she reaches back in pain. Make an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm intimidated.\nLAURA: What should we ask her?\nTALIESIN: Aha ha! 21!\nORION: I'm using my Mage Hand to poke her in the face.","response":"DM: She's trying to move her face out of the way but she can't seem to avoid the mystical arcane finger pokes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Look, we haven't got all day. How do we fix it–\nLAURA: Who do you work for?\nTALIESIN: And who do you work for?","response":"DM: “You fell, surface-slime. You've already fallen, and the Master's gathered the sheep. You shall all be harvested for K'varn!”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ah, is he a farmer?\nSAM: You can't understand her. Only she can.\nLAURA: You can't understand!\nORION: Oh.\nLAURA: Who is K'varn? Does anybody know?\nSAM: No, is that a thing? Is that a person?\nLAURA: I don't know. I don't know. I've got–\nTALIESIN: Can I roll history on that or is\nthat–?\nLAURA: Who is K'varn?\nORION: The Carvers!","response":"DM: You can roll history, if you like."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: To take the surface back?\nTALIESIN: A 14 in history wouldn't do anything?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is K'varn the one making creepy zombie monsters?","response":"DM: “K'varn likes to tinker with the fleshlings, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where is K'varn located? Point the direction.","response":"DM: Looks over her shoulder back towards the darker part of the cavern where you guys haven't traversed. “Deep. Deep.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What is K'varn?\nLAURA: What. Is. K'varn?","response":"DM: “You'll see.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, you'll tell me now.\nTRAVIS: Good question.\nLAURA: I slap her across the face.","response":"DM: Argh!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lightly! Not enough to make her lose a hit point.\nORION: I poke her more!\nMARISHA: It's like a Three Stooges act.","response":"DM: “My life is already forfeit.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh!","response":"DM: “I'm just relishing your faces, for they will be gnarled and twisted soon enough!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Break her legs. Leave her here.","response":"DM: You break her–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Heal her. Maybe we should heal her–\nLAURA: And let her lay there. Is that evil? That's pretty evil.\nTRAVIS: What's your alignment? I mean–\nLAURA: My alignment. I'm good.\nTALIESIN: She did just help–\nMARISHA: Wait! Ask her if she's seen Nostoc. Or if they've seen–\nLAURA: Oh yes!\nMARISHA: Or, yeah, if they've seen our paladin friend. Our little–\nTALIESIN: Lady Kima.\nMARISHA: Lady Kima!\nLAURA: Before we end your life, tell us, have you seen a small halfling?","response":"DM: You see a moment of recognition in the female duergar's face, and it's– “There was a halfling, aye. She was foolish enough to come down here alone. She's dead now.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (gasps)","response":"DM: “We've taken her life and it was delicious.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I drag her to her feet. Walk her over to the edge of the cliff where the water is, and hold her. Knife still at her neck. Tell this one: Now's her last chance to give us anything useful to lead to her boss, I guess.","response":"DM: Make an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to assist her by taking my other dagger and letting it drip poison down the blade.\nLIAM: Advantage? Advantage?\nLAURA: Intimidation of 14?\nLIAM: Assist?","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll dice."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.\nLIAM: Drip drip drip drip drip.","response":"DM: I'm giving you the advantage on the roll because he has a blade to her now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, okay. Okay, still 14.","response":"DM: Still 14."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I should've rolled my other one. To see. Just to see.\nSAM: Can I tell if she's lying? Is it–","response":"DM: Make an insight check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, can I see if she's lying?","response":"DM: You can also make an insight check as well."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I can't understand what the– What the hell's she saying?\nLAURA: Okay, that's way better! 24!","response":"DM: 24. She is definitively lying through her teeth."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes! We know you're lying!","response":"DM: “What?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes! I don't know what else to ask her, guys. I don't know what else to ask her.\nTRAVIS: What are goblins afraid of?","response":"DM: She looks at you for a second, goes, “Regardless, we have her. She's down below. And, soon enough, “you'll see. You'll see what shall become of this halfling.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We'll rescue her! And we're going to kill your god!\nLIAM: I did it, I did it.","response":"DM: An ichor spray comes across."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ugh!\nLAURA: That was the worst thing.\nTALIESIN: The most awkward throat-slitting I've ever heard of.\nSAM: That was very fast.\nMARISHA: We're going to kill your god. Wait.\nTALIESIN: Wait.\nMARISHA: Fuck it, just go with it!\nMARISHA: Commit!","response":"DM: As the body goes limp in your hands, you kinda let it tumble over the waterfall."}

It's at some point in the evening."}

You do, however, find on one of them a gnarled implement of some kind, whether it be scavenged or not. It's of a strange, like almost bleached bone ivory that comes to a point at one end."}

{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, I–\nSAM: Ooh!\nLAURA: What is it?\nSAM: Nothing.\nORION: Wonderful, this is. Wonderful. Magic Missiles, of course.\nSAM: It sends out magic missiles!\nLAURA: What!\nORION: This one has seven charges. While holding it, you, you can use an action to expend one or more of its charges to cast the Magic Missile spell from it. For one charge, you cast the first-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot by one for each level by each additional charge you expend. The wand regains 1d6 plus one expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a one, the wand crumples into ashes and then–\nLIAM: This all seems very technical.\nLAURA: Yes, that's awesome–\nSAM: Basically it shoots out six missiles and then it–\nLAURA: Awesome!\nTRAVIS: Isn't that a famous, like–\nMARISHA: It goes pew pew!\nLAURA: I'm glad we killed them before they used that on us.\nLIAM: Yes, it's pretty standard.\nTALIESIN: It's a pew pew stick.\nLIAM: Pretty standard.\nMARISHA: It's a pew pew stick!\nLIAM: Yes.\nMARISHA: Cool!\nORION: Would anybody like to tinker? I mean, I learned this when I was 12.\nLAURA: No, you're unconscious.\nORION: Oh, I'll hold onto it–\nLAURA: Well, yeah. Yeah.\nLIAM: I think Grog may have soiled himself a little. We should probably get Keyleth on the books.\nLAURA: Take a nap so that, maybe–\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nMARISHA: Make sure everyone's in and close by, and get done with everything.\nLAURA: Okay, she's gonna–\nLIAM: Keyleth, you need to study, so we'll take first watch.\nMARISHA: I'm gonna take you guys–\nLAURA: Oh, that's true, you should study while we watch.\nLIAM: You can't study and watch.\nMARISHA: I'm gonna cast Anti-Life Shell. That way everyone at least gets one good hour of sleep.\nLAURA: Oh, good! I like it!","response":"DM: You go ahead and you eventually find one of the corpses of the umber hulk. It takes you a good 25 minutes to eventually carve through its relatively thick hide, chitinous exterior. You put the head on a makeshift spike, and it is now there on display."}

The fire– the stones that were set up around the actual fire pit have probably been there for quite some time, and were set up very uniformly and very well placed. Right above you, on one of the stone walls, you see what appears to be a strange, very well carved symbol. Hard to recognize it. Go ahead and make a religion check."}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ampersand.\nMARISHA: So pretty!","response":"DM: Not quite catching your attention, but it seems to have some significance. And it's fresh, it's not like an ancient symbol that's been there, it maybe could have been there for more than a week or two."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: To get an imprint of it.","response":"DM: Okay, it's very big. It's like four feet by three feet."}

{"prompt":"ORION: Well, 18 plus two.","response":"DM: Oh, okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What's that?","response":"DM: You are familiar with this symbol specifically because of your background. That is the symbol of Bahamut. It is the symbol of the Platinum Dragon."}

{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, it looks like this!","response":"DM: Yes."}

I thought it was K'varn.\nSAM: It's a good thing?\nORION: Bahamut is the essentially nicer deity of the two between him and Tiamat, which is a total asshole, but–\nSAM: Well that must be why Lady Kima came down here.\nORION: Right. So she must have camped here, put this symbol up for protection.","response":"DM: As you are having this discussion, you feel a slight rumble in the ground."}

It's off. I–\nSAM: Something terrible is brewing.\nLAURA: Keyleth– no, what?\nSAM: How is everyone feeling? Do we need to heal? Everyone?\nLAURA: We need to heal this guy.\nSAM: No, what about us?

Yes.\nLAURA: Trinket gives her a massage beforehand to loosen her up.\nMARISHA: I go ahead–\nSAM: (sings) You know you got to cure Grog.\nMARISHA: I go ahead and light some incense.\nORION: Wonderful tune.\nMARISHA: Scanlan. Scanlan, do you still have that deity, that little idol of Pike?\nSAM: I do have my idol of Pike, yes!\nMARISHA: Can we just have that out just so I have her energy.\nSAM: Oh, of course!\nMARISHA: Just feel like I need her.\nSAM: I take out the idol of Pike that I keep always close to my loins, and I hold it tightly, and warmly–\nMARISHA: Okay.\nSAM: – and caress it a little.\nORION: Give it to her.\nORION: Did you want my hand or the statue?","response":"DM: You take a bit of earth from a pouch that you keep of your–"}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I just kind of lay my hands on his forehead.\nLAURA: Oh my gosh!\nSAM: You know, I know Grog very well, and he might enjoy, or be inspired by, a kiss of a female. I'm just saying, just the gentle kiss of a female lips on his might rouse him.\nORION: Ooh, Vex!\nSAM: I've seen it many times.\nORION: You should plant one on him.\nSAM: Vex? Get in there!

{"prompt":"LAURA: No!\nMARISHA: Where's the inspiration die? Where's the inspiration die?\nORION: Didn't you get advantage on that?\nMARISHA: It's a d8, right?","response":"DM: It's a d8."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do I get advantage on this, since I'm taking time?\nLAURA: Yes!","response":"DM: As is, yes, yeah, you have advantage on the roll, yeah!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I do have advantage on this?\nLAURA: Come on, Keyleth! Keyleth, Keyleth, Keyleth!\nORION: Yeah!\nMARISHA: Oh, that's much better!\nLAURA: What? What was it?\nMARISHA: I'm still gonna do the inspiration dice, just in casies. Okay, that's good.\nTALIESIN: That's good.\nMARISHA: Okay, so.","response":"DM: What's the total?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 17 plus 12.","response":"DM: Plus 12?"}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh my god.\nMARISHA: Ah, I'm still shaking.","response":"DM: The dirt that you'd scattered around Grog, and you can see his form kind of take in a deeper breath. His chest expands, and as it does, his eyes, which currently stare off in space, begin to clarify and crystallize and his brow quivers for a second, and you see a little bit of life return to his face."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Ugh. Kittens. Ugh. Nachos. Ugh.\nMARISHA: Grog?","response":"DM: Grog, your sight focuses as the party is gathered around you, looking down upon your currently stretched out physical form in a cavern. You're very confused."}

Look what you did. You were giving me crap about the lightning. Don't ever do that again.\nTRAVIS: Sorry, who woke me up from my sleep?\n(electronic beep)\nLAURA: Oh, Siri did, apparently.\nORION: It was a group effort really, but Keyleth did an amazing job.\nTRAVIS: Keyleth? I run over and I give Keyleth a big ol' bear hug, squeezing maybe a bit too tight.\nMARISHA: Ow.\nLAURA: I think he shit himself while he was unconscious, so that's gotta smell really wonderful.\nTRAVIS: I smell better than I ever have before.\nTRAVIS: I reach into the bag of holding and I get the cask of ale and my goblet, and I pour a little goblet of ale and I give it to Keyleth.\nMARISHA: To Grog!\nALL: To Grog!\nTRAVIS: To me!\nLAURA: Right.\nSAM: I don't even know what that means.

He's back.\nTRAVIS: Blue, oh no, hold on.\nMARISHA: Good.\nTRAVIS: Square!\nORION: I saunter over to Keyleth. That was mighty impressive.\nMARISHA: Oh, thank you.\nORION: That was amazing.\nMARISHA: I had Pike in mind. I channeled her energy.\nSAM: It's true, it was quite astounding. I have a little chub on.\nLAURA: (groans)\nLAURA: You're welcome.\nMARISHA: Yeah well, that's a bit of a side effect.\nTRAVIS: It must be the morning.\nMARISHA: That's part of the Greater Restoration, a few things get restored.\nTRAVIS: God bless you.\nLIAM: Do you remember anything about a kiss in your dreams while you were asleep?\nTRAVIS: Well, my cheeks are sort of sore for some reason, as if they've been slapped repeatedly by a bunch of twats, and then I've got this one little wet mark right here where I got a kiss and it smells like half-elvish spit.\nLIAM: Oh, that was Trinket. Trinket helped with the spell. Gave you a kiss and helped wake you up.\nLAURA: Oh, why didn't I have Trinket–\nTALIESIN: And several slaps.","response":"DM: At which point you look over and Trinket is there off to the side, notably excited that you're moving again."}

{"prompt":"SAM: Let's do some Grog healing.

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Nipple tassels! That's way better.","response":"DM: But that's for the day. Once you've used those nine hit dice to heal yourself naturally, you are maxed out outside of magical healing or potions."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I've used two.\nSAM: Shall we tarry on, everyone?\nLIAM: Yes, I have a feeling these tunnels are going to suck majorly, but we have nowhere to go but down, so–\nLAURA: So we know which tunnel she pointed towards?","response":"DM: She pointed towards the rest of the cavern, which you have just stepped into."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I use tracking and see if I can not only see where the majority of tracks lead to, but see if I can spot the halfling Kima's tracks.","response":"DM: Lady Kima. Go ahead and make a survival check."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: I do!","response":"DM: What are your favored enemies?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: My favored enemies are dragons and demons.","response":"DM: So you would not have advantage on this."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ah, screw that","response":"DM: That's okay. What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, but I do. Wait. My favored terrain is the Underdark.\nLAURA: That doesn't count if it rolls onto a phone?\nLIAM: I think that's in this book.","response":"DM: Yeah, yeah, I think it's chapter four."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 19 is what I rolled.","response":"DM: 19. Okay. As you guys begin to move, you can find, like, there is this waterfall. Which you can hear in the distance, there are a number of cascading, crashing water sounds. So you imagine there are multiple layers as this cavern descends down into the darkness. What are you using for a light source, by the way?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Tiberius, yeah?\nSAM: Tiberius, hit us.\nORION: What's happening?\nSAM: Light\nTRAVIS: Oh, ah.","response":"DM: The cavern comes alive with bright white light."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, right. Sunglasses.","response":"DM: Using that, you take a while and you begin to just keep tabs on the surface area of this cavern as you begin to move further down. You find some portions where you can climb down to the lower levels. The first thing you notice is there are definitive signs of struggle or intense running towards the direction that you came from. Meaning things were seemingly either fleeing or heading that direction very quickly. Some of them appear to be more recent than others. You also begin to see a few partially decomposed corpses of various goblinoid creatures. You find two goblins just slain, just cut open, and off to the side you see some of the skin is pulled tight against the bone as a lot of it is just rotting from the cave itself. Not a very great smell. There have been small pockets of struggle the more you progress down this way. You also find some drag marks that are similar to what you saw back in the mines, and as you move forward and the light begins to open up, you can see small pockets of that red stone that's used to light a bunch of Kraghammer. You can start seeing elements of it embedded in the walls of the cavern ahead and just faintly giving this reddish glow and the outline of some shapes. You begin to step into the outskirts about 60 feet ahead of what looks like a series of huts, small stone structures cobbled together with small stone and stacked on each other. Simple driftwood and broken pieces of scavenged material put into small buildings. It's a very kinda ramshackle village underground."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's burn it down.\nLIAM: I am stealthing. I roll stealth.\nLAURA: Oh, okay, I'm gonna stealth too.\nLIAM: Natural 20.\nMARISHA: Woohoo!\nLAURA: Natural 20. Oh, that really didn't count.\nLIAM: Just roll on your phone a couple times and then off to the side.\nLAURA: They all sucked, so.\nLIAM: And you said that the red crystals on the wall are glowing somewhat?","response":"DM: Yeah, it's a certain amount of crystal that this mountain range seems to naturally produce that just inherently."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Enough to give the half-elves vision in low light?","response":"DM: It seems such. At the point where you're close to it. Currently you have to use his light source to see much of anything. This village doesn't have any, but near the walls and the edges of the cavern you can see the gentle outline of this whole size of it. It's immense."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Does it seem that there are signs of life?","response":"DM: From this view, you don't see any movement."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I am starting to creep along the ground towards the nearest building and press up against the wall and see if I can– I'm just going to listen.\nLAURA: I rolled a 16, is that enough to actually stealth?","response":"DM: That's up to you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No.\nMARISHA: I'm going to let the twins stealth ahead.","response":"DM: You guys stealth ahead. The two of you follow each other, and you get to the outskirts, and you can now see in the center of this, a number of the buildings and huts have been smashed or destroyed. You can see more and more of these goblin corpses strewn across the ground. You can see some of these tents seem to have rags or something stuffed into one that's not too far ahead of you. There's two goblins near you, apparently slashed open. Similar wounds. It's just from the first glance stepping forward."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: None of them alive, that we can tell?","response":"DM: Nope."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We can't see any movement anywhere?","response":"DM: Not from this perspective. You guys moved ahead and you barely have any light source of your own. You're having to deal with just the outskirts of his light spell."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And none of that red light is lighting any of this?","response":"DM: Not in the center of the village. Those are only towards the outside walls of the cavern."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So we're in the dark.\nLAURA: Can I go up and see if I can get one of those little red rocks?","response":"DM: You can walk off to the side. So you take a few minutes to walk off to the very edge of the cavern. The rock is less of an actual stone that you can pull, more than it's a cluster of– almost like a vein of the stone in the actual wall. It would take a while for you to actually hack it out of the side. It can be done, but it will take you a while."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nah. I don't want to waste the time.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What do you think, should I do it?\nLIAM: No.\nLAURA: Okay, cool.\nLIAM: But we're in pitch black here, and we can't really see what's going on. I think we need–\nLAURA: A lantern.\nLIAM: And Tiberius.\nLAURA: (whispers) Tiberius.\nLIAM: Wait, hold on. Tiberius, will you bring the party up?\nORION: Oh yes, of course, we'll be right there.\nLAURA: Does anybody know– have we told anybody at home what that actually is?","response":"DM: Okay, so as you guys are aware, one of the magical items that was designed by Tiberius early in the campaign are essentially these gem enchanted earrings that activate as a Message spell between a few party members. He made a few of them."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It was five total. Why don't we nail down who that is. It's the twins.\nLAURA: We both have one.\nLIAM: You.\nORION: You have one. He has one. She has one.\nSAM: And we can send and receive messages or just receive?","response":"DM: You're essentially whispering into each other's ears."}
{"prompt":"ORION: They're like walkie-talkies.\nLAURA: It's like a walkie-talkie.","response":"DM: But it only works within a certain range."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is it like a Madonna microphone?","response":"DM: A straight up with a big ol'–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I think it's like 500 feet.","response":"DM: 500 feet is the maximum length. So. You guys approach slowly, the light source opens up, and you see now a multitude of goblin bodies strewn about the open area of this village. You can see there are actually piles of corpses stuffed into some of these huts in the sides that aren't goblin. You can see what looks like a few small dwarven bodies piled up on the side. As you kinda glance over you look, some of them are partially eaten like they have been stripped for meat."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ew.\nTRAVIS: What?","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 24.\nLIAM: 22.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Check that building?","response":"DM: As you look through the building, there are piles of bone, sinew, and metal at this point. The dwarven bodies are mostly decomposed entirely, what remnants have not been stripped off it for food."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Anything useful in the pile?","response":"DM: As far as what you guys can tell, you discover two things. One of the dwarves has a set of very very finely crafted leather armor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh.","response":"DM: To pull it off the corpse is going to destroy it and going to be a not very interesting affair."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: But it does look to have survived the horrible conditions under here. You also note specifically, Vex, that not the dwarven corpses, but a number of the goblin corpses you come across, some of them have a uniform wound. A number of these goblin corpses have this terrible puncture wound in the skull."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.","response":"DM: In the forehead there. Just an opening wound about that big around."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You didn't notice that, that's how unperceptive you are.\nLIAM: My sister, everybody.","response":"DM: And for each one of these wounds– for as much flesh is on these goblins, there doesn't appear to be anything inside."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It sucked their brains out. Whatever it was.","response":"DM: It's very possible."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I know what that feels like.\nORION: Ooh, brain suckers.\nTRAVIS: Are we with you?\nLAURA: No, you're not, you're still hanging out–\nSAM: We've come back.\nTRAVIS: Did you put your finger in the hole?\nLAURA: I'm going to put my finger in the hole.\nORION: I sauntered up 'cause–\nSAM: You sauntered up.\nORION: You guys are sticking to the darkness?","response":"DM: Your finger goes inside, you reach around. There are elements of brain matter within there but even that has become very gelatinous."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oatmeal.","response":"DM: Partially decomposed in its own right, almost like a slime. But sure enough, the inside of the cranium itself is mostly vacant."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lovely. Trinket, no, he's not with us.","response":"DM: Trinket is back with the party."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So we can only assume that, what was his name?\nSAM: Should we rejoin our fellows?\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nLAURA: I guess it seems like it's safe enough, right? Around here right now?\nTRAVIS: We come running up.\nORION: We do.\nSAM: Traipsing, we traipse up.\nTRAVIS: Skipping.\nLAURA: As silently as possible, you come running up.\nTRAVIS: (sings)\nSAM: What's going on, guys?\nLAURA: Brain suckers, something that sucks brains.\nSAM: As long as they are sucking it out of goblins, I'm good with that.\nLIAM: My sister doesn't remember, but one of our instructors in Syngorn used to tell us of a creature, I'm not sure what they're called, but–\nLAURA: I don't think I was in that class, actually.\nLIAM: Mm. A creature that steals its victims' minds and digests them, reaches right in and takes them out.\nORION: I'm assuming it's got to be a much smaller, mutated version of our brain-on-legs friend.\nLIAM: I think it's much worse.\nMARISHA: Yeah. Much worse.\nLAURA: Much worse?\nLIAM: Much worse.\nORION: Yeah.\nLIAM: I think the brain was a scout or some sort of pet.\nMARISHA: Well, we also have this K'varn, who is experimenting on all those creatures, so we can't even attest for any of this.\nLAURA: Exactly.\nORION: That's true.\nTRAVIS: I take a few steps back.\nTALIESIN: It could just be parts of one.\nMARISHA: Yeah, parts of one. It could be a hodge-podge of everything\nTALIESIN: A dragon, goblin drained, brained–\nLAURA: (gasps) What if K'varn is a dragon? What if– oh wait, I don't know anything about that. What was that symbol anyway, Tiberius?\nORION: That was a symbol of Bahamut, and it was a protection thing that I'm sure she put up to protect herself.\nLAURA: Oh. So it was a good symbol?\nORION: It was, yes.\nLAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: You recall that Lady Kima was, specifically, a paladin of Bahamut."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! So she probably did that.\nMARISHA: So she's been here.","response":"DM: That camp seems to have been hers while she was traipsing through the tunnels."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I understand.\nTALIESIN: Ah!\nLIAM: I just think we should proceed with caution. Our teachers spoke about this thing, said that it was a being of the mind. I think our trouble with Grog could just be the beginning. We need to proceed very carefully.\nLAURA: Oh no!\nTRAVIS: I have two potions of fox's cunning. Could I drink one of those, since there's a giant brain-bitch wondering around the camp?\nMARISHA: That's for your wisdom.\nSAM: How long do they last?\nLAURA: You could make yourself smarter?\nTRAVIS: But it don't last very long.","response":"DM: Fox's cunning would give you benefit, I believe, to–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Intelligence.","response":"DM: I mean, essentially–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It would be Enhance Ability, essentially.","response":"DM: It would be Enhance Ability for wisdom, I'm"}
{"prompt":"pretty sure.\nMARISHA: I'll tell you. I think it's wisdom.\nTRAVIS: Not intelligence?\nMARISHA: No, no, no, it's intelligence.","response":"DM: It's intelligence? Okay, there you go."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Because I think it's like owl's wisdom for wisdom.","response":"DM: Right, no, you're correct. So essentially it would be an Enhance Ability for intelligence, yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How long does it last?","response":"DM: Oh, for the potion's effect? That would be anywhere from four to eight hours, you're not quite sure."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Maybe you should wait until we come across something.\nMARISHA: Yeah, you have advantage on intelligence checks.\nLIAM: Just don't go running off into the dark again.\nLAURA: Yeah, let us lead the way, or whoever's smart. I'm really smart, how smart are you?\nLIAM: Not smart enough, apparently.\nMARISHA: So it wouldn't necessarily–\nTRAVIS: It wouldn't make my intelligence higher?\nMARISHA: It wouldn't make your intelligence higher, and it wouldn't necessarily help with your vulnerability.\nLIAM: He's smart.\nLAURA: Who's our smartest person? Who has the highest intelligence here?\nLIAM: What are these scores you keep talking about? I don't know what anybody's talking about.\nORION: It's okay, Vax. I don't know what a lot of people are talking about all of the time.\nTALIESIN: IRL?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, whoever's the smartest should be in the front.\nLAURA: That's true.\nTALIESIN: I'm sitting at 16.\nTRAVIS: 14.\nLIAM: 16.\nLAURA: 16.\nMARISHA: Well it's about, like, having high– it's not necessarily being smart, it's about having resistance to willpower.\nLAURA: But if they take you down– if they take down your intelligence, then whoever has higher intelligence–\nMARISHA: Right.\nSAM: No one's going to take down our intelligence, we're too strong and we're too awesome.\nORION: And we know what we're going into.\nMARISHA: Well, we sort of know what we're going into.\nTRAVIS: Does that mean we get to run into a fight?\nMARISHA: Hang on.\nSAM: Or festive.\nLAURA: Oh no!\nMARISHA: Okay, so here's my question.\nLIAM: Yeah.\nMARISHA: So we've already fought two things where we can't look at them and they mess with our heads.\nTRAVIS: Right.\nLAURA: Yes.\nMARISHA: So is there something we can do going forward–\nLAURA: To like boost our willpower or something?\nMARISHA: Or like–\nTALIESIN: You want Magneto's helmet? What you want is Magneto's helmet.\nMARISHA: I like Magneto's helmet! Or even if we–\nTALIESIN: I haven't built Magneto's helmet.\nMARISHA: Do we have a bunch of mirrors? Or where we can look through things with reflections.\nLAURA: (gasps) I gave you some mirrors! Do you remember?\nLIAM: I have mirrors.\nTRAVIS: We do have a big dressing mirror.\nLIAM: But that's more for–\nLAURA: For looking around corners?\nLIAM: I don't know if that's going to help.\nLAURA: It could help!\nORION: I could make a mirror.\nLIAM: Yes, I have them, of course. I always, I always have them, they were a gift.\nTRAVIS: We have one mirror in the bag of holding.\nLAURA: That's good!\nORION: With like an ice-type of thing–\nLAURA: We could put a mirror–\nMARISHA: Kind of like a Medusa's gaze thing. You know, where you like look in the reflection.\nLIAM: But that's a Gorgon. That's talking about the gaze–\nMARISHA: Right.\nLIAM: We're talking about the mind, I think.\nLAURA: Right.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nSAM: I have a whip! And a forgery kit.\nMARISHA: It would just be about making us less vulnerable to the mind–\nLIAM: Could you forge some professor hats for us all?\nLAURA: So what, our option is to keep moving forward, then?\nSAM: Yes, just be cautious, that's all we can do.\nLIAM and TALIESIN: That's all we can do.\nTRAVIS: We move forward.\nSAM: What do you want to do, you want go back?\nLAURA: As quietly as possible, to keep moving forward.\nTALIESIN: It's difficult to prepare for what we're not prepared for.\nLAURA: And on the lookout for anything in this ramshackle town.\nMARISHA: That's true.\nTALIESIN: Sorry.\nMARISHA: I mean, I can cast Enhance Ability to help our willpower? Or our will.","response":"DM: So you leave behind the pile of dwarven corpses, you leave behind the goblin corpses with the wounds and start seeing more of a pattern."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And if I may, I suggest Tiberius, you work your Light spell, and Vex'ahlia and I scout ahead about 60 or 70 feet, so that we can see in the dim light, catch anything coming, using your magic.\nLAURA: Yes.\nTRAVIS: And I light up the hooded lantern we have in the bag of holding.","response":"DM: Okay. So you put the hood on and light that up, very good. Leaving the leather armor behind?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh well, I thought you said it would get ruined if we took it?\nLIAM: And it was dwarf-sized.","response":"DM: No, it would be nasty pulling it off a corpse."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, well then, fuck it, let's pull it off.\nLIAM: Isn't it dwarf-sized? Or is armor also shrink and expand?\nLAURA: It's magical. Possibly.","response":"DM: It's dwarf-sized."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Magical.\nORION: It's fine. I cast Prestidigitation and clean it all up.\nLAURA: I take it.","response":"DM: Okay, so you shake off the element–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: All the goo.","response":"DM: – the remaining elements of the dwarven corpse. Just falls off out of the armor. You have to kind of shake it and eventually all of it escapes–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes. Thank you!\nTALIESIN: Dwarven corpse.\nLIAM: It's like pulled pork.\nLAURA: Mm.","response":"DM: Make an arcana check. It does have a magical aura."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) What is it?\nORION: Nice. 20.\nLAURA: Plus two enchantment to what?\nSAM: Plus two enchantment?","response":"DM: To your AC."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: If I try to pull on the sleeve, does it come up to my elbow or does it stretch out and fit?","response":"DM: It comes up to your elbow and then, given a moment, it fits to your form."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh, yeah!\nLIAM: That's nice.\nLAURA: Go take that studded leather armor, brother!\nLIAM: I'll take this, hold on. Thank you. I go into the smelly corpse hut and start to change my armor.\nLAURA: What did you get? Let me see that.\nSAM: So wait, does he get a bigger or higher AC? What is that?","response":"DM: Yes, it is considered– it works as studded leather armor, but that gives him a plus two bonus to his armor class on top of that."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wow, that's huge!\nLAURA: Yeah, so he just took it.\nSAM: I'll take it.\nLAURA: He already took it.\nMARISHA: Hey, dungeon master? Asking as the dungeon master.","response":"DM: Yes?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: If I cast Owl's Wisdom on people, it gives people advantage on wisdom checks. Would that count on saving throws against willpower?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Damn it!","response":"DM: Not checks, specifically."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Would it help anything?","response":"DM: I mean–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Would, would any advantage to wisdom under Enhance Ability help some?","response":"DM: Let me double-check it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'll give you all dice before we go in.\nLAURA: Some of these– I remember we rolled charisma saving throws, though, for the umbers. They were charisma.\nMARISHA: Right. And for the brains it was versus willpower.\nSAM: While the DM looks this up, everyone, subscribe to the Geek and Sundry twitch channel! Support the show, support the channel.\nMARISHA: Yeah! And don't forget about our charity, 826LA, which helps children be literate and write stories well.\nORION: It makes them smarter in the head.\nSAM: And keep sending us food.\nTRAVIS: We like food.\nSAM: And more presents.\nLIAM: If you want a thousand years–\nZAC: There's more food on the way, so don't ask them for more.\nMARISHA: What?\nORION: Oh, no!\nTRAVIS: No food!\nTALIESIN and SAM: No more food.","response":"DM: Yeah, we have enough food, guys, thank you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: If you want a thousand years of D&D, we've got to pay the overheads, so please, subscribe!\nORION: It's true!","response":"DM: So yeah, unfortunately it helps ability checks, those are not considered saving throws."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't know if I have anything.\nORION: As we start to walk, I cast Stoneskin on myself.\nLIAM: Once you've got the dwarf gunk off, it's rather nice.\nLAURA: Oh yeah?\nLIAM: Yes, it's supple.\nTALIESIN: Let's go.\nLAURA: Let's go, let's keep on moving!\nMARISHA: Let's get it done.\nORION: (sings) Keep on keeping on.","response":"DM: You guys keep pushing forward."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is that what we're going to do?\nTRAVIS: We've got to get it closer than that.\nLAURA: I'm still tracking, looking for anything interesting.","response":"DM: Which you do, you catch, off in the distance, another faint moving light source."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh shit! Hey, everybody, calm down.\nSAM: Huh?\nLAURA: Sh! There's something moving in the distance.","response":"DM: Everyone roll a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Stealth check?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god, roll a stealth check. (gasps) Natural 20!\nMATT and LIAM: Nice!\nLIAM: 30.\nMARISHA: 15.\nORION: 11.\nSAM: 20.\nTALIESIN: 12.\nTRAVIS: (softly) Six.","response":"DM: Okay, as you all buckle down and be as quiet as you can–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You rolled a six? He rolled a six.","response":"DM: You begin to see–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (whispers) Grog rolled a six.\nLIAM: (whispers) Stay put, you asshole.","response":"DM: No, noted, that's okay, that's okay. It's a group check, in which case people offset each other's difficulty."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yay, bell curve.","response":"DM: So you seem to be comfortable in the stillness of the moment. Best you can see in the distance, you see figures shifting, moving away from you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispers) Sh, figures!","response":"DM: Many figures. A fairly large group of seeming to be humanoid figures, moving steadily away from you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we scout ahead? We're both really super stealth, can we like–\nLIAM: Yeah, we're gonna start kinda quickly dash after them.","response":"DM: Yeah, using your same stealth rolls, you push forward."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Humanoid figures, you say?\nLIAM: Could mean anything.","response":"DM: Yes, best you could tell. As you guys start reaching the outskirts of the opposite side of this small, goblin village that has been completely sundered, you see a cliff, but a large cliff. The actual surface here comes to a very direct end and seems to just disappear into a dark abyss. There is a singular, ten-foot-wide rope bridge, that is bolted into the side of this cliff and stretches out across this giant crevasse, for what– you can't see the other side."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Awesome!\nLAURA: This feels like The Descent, I don't like this, you guys.","response":"DM: It very much has that kind of a feel. It just goes on a for a good 60, 70 feet, and then darkness. And you can see what looks to be a cluster of about 12 to 13 duergar–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispers) Oh no.","response":"DM: – making their way in lines of two across this bridge. Amongst them, they have, chained up, three dwarf miners that they are also dragging across the bridge."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We have to save those ones.\nTRAVIS: Just cut the bridge\nSAM: No, no!\nLAURA: What do the miners look like? Are they– are they docile, or are they– do they seem to be fighting back?","response":"DM: They don't appear to put up much of a fight in their current circumstance."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How wide is the bridge?","response":"DM: Ten feet."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ten feet? That means two people wide.\nLAURA: Grog goes by himself. Yes.\nLIAM: But if we go out there, it's going to be close combat.\nTRAVIS: (whispers) We have a flying carpet.\nLIAM: You can't get to the ones at the back.\nLAURA: I mean how many are there? Like ten or so?\nLIAM: 12. 12 I count.","response":"DM: From what you can see it looks about 12-ish"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And they have a light source with them so we can definitely see them?","response":"DM: They do, it's a very faint light. It's like a small cluster of the red stone that's been mined and put into a spherical element and is hanging from a chain like a lantern."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We have two options. We can fight them.\nLIAM: We could fight now.\nLAURA: Or follow them.\nTRAVIS: Follow.\nLAURA: I think we follow them.\nMARISHA: Do I see any– are there any bats?","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: If we follow them on the bridge, won't they feel it bouncing?\nMARISHA: I failed.\nLAURA: We gotta wait 'til they cross it, Scanlan.\nSAM: We can't see the end of it.\nLIAM: I grab my ear and, Keyleth, I heard you through Tiberius' earring, why don't you just become a bat and follow along?\nLAURA: She's trying to do that.\nMARISHA: I was gonna see if they're in the–\nLIAM: You've never seen a bat in the woods?","response":"DM: Best you can tell, and from your knowledge of bats and their existence, they generally live in caverns that have readily available openings to the outside world, where they do their nocturnal hunting. This is a very, very deep cavern that does not have easy access to the surface. Bats are probably not a good chance in this cavern."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I've got an idea. I run back to Grog, stealthed. I get our flying carpet.","response":"DM: A hand suddenly mysteriously reaches into the bag."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (sputters)\nLAURA: Gimme the carpet.\nTRAVIS: What?\nLAURA: The carpet. Gimme the carpet.\nSAM: Just you? You're gonna go on the carpet alone?\nLAURA: And him. we can both go on the carpet.\nSAM: What if something happens?\nLAURA: We just gotta see where they're going! We'll come back and get you.\nSAM: I'm coming with you.\nTRAVIS: I give them her carpet, but I also tie the endless rope thread around.\nLAURA: Oh yeah. Okay, so we have an endless rope with us.\nLIAM: Now we're a kite.","response":"DM: You pull out the carpet and lay it out. At this point in time, they're a little over halfway across the bridge."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, so we–","response":"DM: Which, you can see it swaying in a very uncomfortable way."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Scanlan, you better be stealthed.","response":"DM: You hear the stretching of ropes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, you can hear the rope?","response":"DM: As you hear the rope just tense as the bridge is slowly swaying. So you guys lay out the carpet. The two of you get on?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA and LIAM: And Scanlan.\nLIAM: I grab Scanlan by the scruff of his neck.","response":"DM: The three of you guys hop on, and it's probably big enough for the three of you. It's about the right size."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Shotgun.","response":"DM: The carpet begins to lift off, and you kind of will it towards– Are you going straight over the bridge or are you taking a side route?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're going next to the bridge.\nLIAM: Side and up. 'Cause they can look sideways.\nLAURA: I think we should go down below the bridge.\nLIAM: If you're on a bridge, you're looking down at your feet.\nSAM: Let's go above them.","response":"DM: Okay so you guys, you take up over. First off, the three of you guys make a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I thought we were still stealthed?","response":"DM: Maneuvering on a flying carpet is a different type of locomotion."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We have a flying carpet, by the way. That's a thing.\nSAM: Not great. 13.\nLIAM: 29.\nLAURA: 17.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Were you guys trying to stealth? Is that what happened?\nTRAVIS: Shit.\nSAM: Way down below.","response":"DM: Way down below."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's a ways.","response":"DM: It's at least a thousand feet down."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We don't want to fall.","response":"DM: Don't fall, it's very bad. The air itself has a very sulfurous smell. There's a lot of various strange chemical scents that's a bit pungent to the nose. There's a lot of chemical reactions that are causing this atmosphere. It's a little difficult to take any air at first. You have to get adjusted. It is a very, very deep cavern below. When you look behind, you can see the river that's been cascading through this cavern goes rocketing off the edge and disappears into the darkness below. Are you keeping your distance or–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Keeping a good distance.\nLIAM: Distance, because they have a light source, so we want to follow that.\nLAURA: Yeah, so we need to stay kind of out of it but see it.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys push forward, keeping at a safe distance. You eventually follow them across the crevasse, and you can see now them entering what looks like a shanty town of tents and small stone structures. Better built than the goblin village that was previously there, but it looks almost like a temporary or pseudo-temporary series of homes for the duergar in this section. There's a bunch of military tents and cloth pup tents put up in sections. You can see some easy-to-construct one- or two-day constructions of stone buildings. Very square, very rigid and dwarven in their design, more for utility that any sort of visual presentation or beauty."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is a temporary war camp.\nLAURA: It is.","response":"DM: There are also a series of these-"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes!","response":"DM: – of these redstone–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good dialogue!","response":"DM: Yeah, it's legit guys. A series of these redstone torches that they were holding, or these lanterns, are hung up all throughout the village on these giant poles that have been placed in areas to give a little bit of an occasional light source throughout this entire camp."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: About how many people does it look like– I mean, how big is this camp?","response":"DM: How big, the camp?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How many buildings?","response":"DM: At a first glance, you can only check out elements of it from your distance, you're only making out shapes from how far back you guys are without actually getting inside. You gather you've probably seen throughout, just this portion that you've come into, anywhere from 30 to 40 duergar moving through, as well as a few larger shapes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispers) Oh, shit.","response":"DM: You swear you catch one or two other very large humanoid hulking figures just"}
{"prompt":"(thudding noises)\nLAURA: Oh no.","response":"DM: Stepping through the camp."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How are we gonna get through this?\nLAURA: How are we– what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?\nSAM: The view up here is beautiful!\nLAURA: (sings) A whole new world.\nMARISHA: (whispers) Hey, hey, what do you guys see?\nORION: Scanlan, what's going on?\nLAURA: (whispers) Okay, so–\nSAM: Is the range? How are–","response":"DM: The range is getting a little broken, you can hear–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: The words are coming through but–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You're cutting out. I can't hear you\nLAURA: Okay.\nLIAM: I think–\nLAURA: Well, one of us.\nSAM: We'll update you soon.\nLAURA: Well, one of us. Let's put down.\nLIAM: Put down?\nTRAVIS: In the volcano?\nLAURA: No no no, how are we, like–\nTRAVIS: Just go straight down.\nLAURA: At a place where we can land the carpet and stand around.\nSAM: They'll probably see us.\nLAURA: Or should we go back?\nLIAM: We're past the chasm at this point or still afloat?","response":"DM: You've just now crested–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The other side.","response":"DM: The crevasse the other side. And you're feeling uncomfortable pushing further forward because you're now starting to get a lot more eyes in your vicinity."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, are there any– does it look like– do we see any cavern openings in the vicinity? Does it look like there's any?","response":"DM: Looking around, there are no side caverns, this is actually a pretty smooth cavern that kind of circles around where this camp is built, there is one large tunnel entrance on the opposite side that continues past."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But they're blocking it? Or–","response":"DM: You can't see anything beyond the fact that the tunnel– the walls kind of convene. You can see a little bit of a tunnel opening and just darkness beyond that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So, bridge to land, and then a tunnel.","response":"DM: A tunnel on the other side, and where the land starts there's a giant portion of the cavern that continues and then closes off, kind of pinches, to the entrance to where the camp is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How far away is the camp from that?","response":"DM: The camp is completely filling this side of the cross. It's blocking pretty much the whole."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, so we can't get to that.","response":"DM: Not without going through or over the city."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What about–\nLIAM: So it's bridge, town, tunnel.\nSAM: Tunnel.","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do we see any closer– Under the bridge, are there any openings underneath the bridge that look like–","response":"DM: Do you want to swoop down and check?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, you swoop down and–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (whoosh)","response":"DM: –the rock there–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whoosh)","response":"DM: (whoosh) – the warm air is still kinda bothering you in general."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (makes farting noise)\nLAURA: Excuse me.","response":"DM: You find yourself kinda taking your cloak and putting it over your mouth just to get the scent out. The side of the rock surface is worn through what looks like maybe a possible river that also came from the other side that has since dried out, so you can see there is, while no water on this side of the crevasse, a lot of the stone has been smoothed just through rapid water running for thousands of years possibly. But there are no visible openings or other additional caverns on this rock surface"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What are we gonna do?\nTRAVIS: (whispers) Are they still on–\nSAM: Okay, listen. Leave me behind, I'll follow the party with the hostages, I'll see where they go. Don't worry, I'll be invisible. Go back, tell our fellows, get them across the bridge, and we'll meet here in about an hour.\nMARISHA: Okay.\nLAURA: Scanlan!\nTRAVIS: I like it.\nSAM: What? I'm super brave and hung, come on, let's do this.\nLAURA: We drop him off.\nSAM: I turn invisible.\nTRAVIS: (sings) Scanlan, the best bard.\nSAM: And I'm gonna just hang behind the party that's got the hostage dwarves, and just kinda see where they go.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should one of us protect him?\nTRAVIS: Do you activate hung at the same time?\nSAM: Don't have to activate.\nLIAM: He's invisible, though.\nTRAVIS: Okay.\nLAURA: I mean, we can't go invisible, we can't be as like–\nLIAM: No.\nSAM: It's passive.\nMARISHA: It's a racial bonus.\nSAM: Yeah but I might make– I might snap twigs.\nLIAM: Last question. Where are the people, the figures we were following?\nDid they finish the bridge at this point?","response":"DM: They're long past the bridge, they're inside the city proper at this point."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nLIAM: Okay, so then I'll stay by the edge of the bridge, you go back. Scanlan, go ahead, I'll wait for you here, if there's trouble.\nSAM: Ding-a-ling-a-ling!\nLIAM: Yes.\nSAM: Got it.\nLAURA: I go back, thanks.\nLIAM: Shit.\nLAURA: Thanks for sending me back. I go back.\nLIAM: Go get the others.\nMARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: Scanlan. As you go ahead, make your way in towards the city, go ahead and make a stealth check with advantage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: C'mon, buddy.\nSAM: 16. 18!","response":"DM: 18, okay. You push, kind of falling behind the main group, and they're heading towards this kind of, more or less a loose thoroughfare in the center of this town. You can see a few duergar coming out and kind of inspecting as they enter, speaking in a language you don't understand, asking questions, some of them are coming out and slapping the dwarf captives as they go across, or spitting on them. The dwarves look very broken and unhappy with the circumstance, but brimming with anger. You see a couple of them are, like true dwarves, they haven't given in to it, they're just looking for an option or a moment to get some vengeance. They're stripped of all armor and weaponry. They're brought through some of the alleys and paths between these pup tents and these stone structures. You can see, there are some of the hulking figures, there are two trolls wandering amongst these duergar."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes! (whispers) Trolls!","response":"DM: Now, you've encountered trolls before, but these trolls–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) Yeah we have.","response":"DM: – also have a similar, pupil-less, clouded over, white-eye appearance–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ooh! They're slave trolls!","response":"DM: As you begin to follow them further in, you manage to see two ogres that are currently stationed across this main open center location in this campsite. And both of these ogres also have the same, pupil-less, white, glazed-over look to their eyes. And they're both just kind of glancing about. The rest of the duergar are in the process of constructing other tents. Some of them look like they're actually in the process of forging weaponry. It feels like it's a war camp. It's definitely preparing for something. However, in the center of this main area, you do see, there is a wooden platform, about 20 foot by 20 foot, that is raised up, and you see a group of about six duergar that are all wearing very intricate, black iron plate armor. And they're all just sitting on the outskirts of this platform."}
{"prompt":"SAM: White eyes?","response":"DM: All the duergar seem to have that natural look to their eyes as well."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Shit.\nSAM: Okay.","response":"DM: As the party you've been following enters the center of this vicinity, make another stealth check, with advantage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Gah. 19.\nTRAVIS: Oh god!\nLAURA: Oh god!\nLIAM: Careful, Bilbo!","response":"DM: And begins stepping out, looking intently for something, but right past you, by inches, as he walks past. You look over again, to the camp, and you can now see, toward the very back end of this open midsection, by this platform, there is one large, stone construct. It looks like a makeshift barracks has been placed there, with double stone doors that are currently opened, and you can see two figures stepping out of the stairs that lead into these barracks, heading towards the main platform. They step up onto the platform. One of which is a very, very well-decorated duergar, who's wearing similar blackened plate armor as the other kind of elite guard that you saw surrounding this platform, but with gold and silver scrolling on it, a long, tattered, dark, dark purple cape, and has a nasty scar across the cheek that leads into this kind of gnarled, grey beard. As it steps forward, you can see, sheathed off to its back in a large scabbard, a gargantuan– for a dwarf especially– two-handed sword that should be unwieldy for a creature of its size. But nevertheless looks dangerous and a creature next to it is–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispers) We can't fight these guys.","response":"DM: – not so small, not dwarven. Actually, very tall, lanky, long, black and purple robes, a hood, obscuring its features, stepping roughly two feet behind it as they both step on to the platform to address the rest of the guard and the approaching party of duergar dwarves you've been following. You can see some conversation happening, but you're too far away to really make out anything that's being said, do you want to move closer?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I speak their language?","response":"DM: Do you speak Undercommon?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Nope!","response":"DM: Then you– it all sounds gibberish to you!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: The captives? Okay.","response":"DM: The captives. Begins pulling them away toward another section on the side. As it does, the tall, lanky figure, which you now get the sense that it's not really walking. It's just kind of drifting–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (apprehensive sound)","response":"DM: – holds its hand out. This long, long finger and lanky hand, and as it does, every single duergar in the vicinity, whatever it was doing, stops in place, and all turn and look at it, as one."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Whoa.","response":"DM: At which point, this creature brings its fingers in a beckoning gesture, loosely in your direction."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm wearing my ring of mind-shielding, by the way.","response":"DM: For a split second, you feel your heart at your throat, and the entire back of your body stands on pins and needles as one of the duergar carrying one of the captives begins to pull one of the dwarven captives back towards the platform. As it does, the dwarf, who is giving kind of a fight and looks nervous, looks over at the figure and its arms go limp to its side, and it begins to walk out of its own volition, taking two, three steps. Steps onto the platform and approaches this tall, lanky figure with the hood and long robes behind it. As it does, its hand reaches out and caresses the side of this dwarf's face. This dwarf seems to have given up all sense of fight or any sort of conflict and just stares up into this darkened hood. As the tall, lanky creature reaches out with both hands and pulls the dwarf forward, you see these terrible purple tentacles come writhing out of the front of the hood, wrapping around the head of the dwarf, pulling it into it. As the hood falls back, you see this horrible smooth, purplish-blue hairless head, these sunken yellowish-green eyes as the tentacles wrap around the dwarf's head and pulls it into its mouth. There's a brief struggle, and then the dwarf's arms fall limp to its side. At which point, the tentacles unravel from its head, the creature pulls back, a bit of ichor and dwarf blood dripping from what looks like a lamprey's toothy maw, and then thrusts the body to the ground, with a thud as it falls lifeless to the ground."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Poor son of a bitch.","response":"DM: A horrible, bored hole in its forehead. The creature then draws its hood back up, releases its hand in a cursory fashion, and all the duergar whip back around and continue the motions they were previously going towards. As the two dwarven captives that now remain look completely stunned, their faces white with fear as they are being dragged off in this state. The tall, lanky figure gives a nod to the duergar general, who gives a nod as well, then to turn around and walk back."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god.\nSAM: Worst show ever. Okay. That was one of the captives. Do I see where the other captives were taken?","response":"DM: The two other captives, you follow them? They both are pulled to– essentially to a western side. If you look overhead, this is where the barrack building is, this is where you entered and this is the main area. They are pulled off to the western side here. They are taken to a large tent. As they are pulled in, they close it behind them. You can hear some muffles and some growling from the inside of the tent."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. I assume bad things are happening in there, I don't need to see it, right? I think I'll just kind of– is there anything–","response":"DM: Do you speak Dwarven?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, oh, no, do I? What do I speak? Where does it say? Shit.","response":"DM: Should be on the lower left-hand of your player sheet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Did you choose languages?\nSAM: I play a shawm. No, I just speak Common and Gnome.","response":"DM: You hear what sounds like guttural Dwarvish being shouted angrily, cursing from the interior, and a few other dwarven voices also joining in– more than two. You hear some horrible, sick thuds and some impacts and some cries of pain. And eventually, the five duergar dragging the captives walk out, carrying cudgels at their side, still dripping with fresh blood. They kind of go amongst their own business from there."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. I think I'll go back to my fellows. There's nothing I can see– that door doesn't lock– does it lock by any chance?","response":"DM: It's just an opening tent."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Open tent. There's nothing lying around, none of that black armor lying around or anything? Any extra things –","response":"DM: Not on the street."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, I think I will just make back for my friends, then.","response":"DM: Okay, make a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, god.\nSAM: With advantage?","response":"DM: With advantage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 21.","response":"DM: You maneuver your way out back the way you came, best you can, remembering– you get disoriented in general trying to find your way out. Go ahead and make a survival check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!\nSAM: Survival check, so plus zero. 17.","response":"DM: 17."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's a good roll, yo.","response":"DM: Okay, you take a moment, orient yourself, looking about the cavern. This is a very confusing network, and the passages you've gone– you paid more attention to what's happening–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's like Venice.","response":"DM: Kind of, yeah. You nearly get lost twice, but eventually find your way back to the southern-portion entrance of this war camp. You can just see the crevasse and you start getting the familiar scent of that sulfurous wind that was billowing out from underneath. You step out a few more feet, and you can see the edge of the bridge where the rest of you have finally come to converge on the other side of the crevasse."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh!\nSAM: Whoa. I am going to tell you everything that just happened, in detail, in real time.\nLAURA: Maybe he can tell us while we are taking a bathroom break?","response":"DM: You know what, let's go ahead and take this moment to have a bathroom break, guys, as sort of the halfway mark."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Holy shit.","response":"DM: We will continue this in just a moment. In the meantime, take a rest, take ten or 11 minutes. We are going to play our character backgrounds for those who haven't seen it. We will be back here in about ten minutes, guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What are we going to do?\nTRAVIS: We are gonna fight the shit out of them.\nLIAM: We're going to risk it all.","response":"DM: – for her as well, so look forward to that some point in the near future. As we left off, the party had just reconvened on the other side of this gargantuan crevasse in the Underdark, after Scanlan had stealthed into the duergar war camp, witnessed a number of dwarven captives being taken somewhere, however, one of which was devoured by some strange creature. Left brainless and dead on the platform in the center, outside of a giant barracks-type building. You reconvened and expressed all of this information to the party."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And that's when I came back to see you guys.\nTRAVIS: Great.\nTALIESIN: Wonderfully detailed.\nLAURA: What are we going to do?\nMARISHA: I give Scanlan some water from my waterskin.\nLIAM: You are a brave little fellow.\nSAM: Thank you.\nLAURA: Has anyone come across these creatures before? These weird tentacle brain guys?\nMARISHA: I've heard rumors of those. Can we make a check for those?\nORION: It sounds like it would be a mind flayer, of sorts.\nLAURA: A mind flayer?\nORION: A mind flayer or mind slayer, I'm not too sure.\nSAM: What is that?\nORION: I'm pretty sure it flays your mind. I'm never encountered one myself, so I have no idea, really. Oh, right, let me check my books.","response":"DM: Intelligence."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 14.","response":"DM: You probably call it a mind flayer."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It says right here, mind flayer. The rest is all inked up. I got water on it.\nTRAVIS: How big was this mind flayer, was he like 20 feet tall, Scanlan?\nSAM: He was tall, I mean everyone looks 20 feet tall to me, I'm a gnome.\nTRAVIS: Was he bigger than me?\nSAM: He was bigger than you by a little?","response":"DM: No, roughly a little shorter than him. But taller than most."}
{"prompt":"SAM: He carried himself big. He was lanky.\nTRAVIS: Let's go fuck him up.\nLAURA: No, Grog!\nTRAVIS: What?\nLAURA: Do you want to be unconscious again? We have to be careful here.\nTRAVIS: It was rather restful.\nLAURA: How many dwarves did it sound like there were locked in that prison cell?\nSAM: Several?\nMARISHA: Did you see Lady Kima?\nSAM: No sign of Lady Kima at all, just a bunch of dwarves being held against their will, and then one by one being brain sucked by Mr. Lanky Man.\nTRAVIS: And those two big trolls.\nORION: Percy, could you take a look at this?\nSAM: Two big trolls, and ogres, don't forget ogres, there's ogres too.\nTRAVIS: There are ogres?\nSAM: Yes, there were two big ogres as well. And duergar aplenty–maybe four dozen or so, three dozen?\nLIAM: Spread throughout the city, throughout this little camp, Scanlan.\nSAM: Wandering. Yes.\nTRAVIS: You know my tactic.\nTALIESIN: Would it be a nature check to actually think if I never learned about this in school?","response":"DM: This would be an intelligence check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This would be an intelligence check?\nTRAVIS: We should use the volcano as part of our strategy. Like Moses–\nSAM: There's a volcano?\nTRAVIS: Well no, the pit–\nSAM: Oh the lava, down below?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, there's a shitload of that.\nMARISHA: Can I meditate to see if I know anything about this–\nLIAM: This seems to match up with the tales that my instructor, master Tharendril, told me about back in Syngorn. I wonder if I remember something. If only I had a small polyhedral to roll– Wow!\nLAURA: Holy moly, you guys.\nTRAVIS: Oh, shitcakes.\nTALIESIN: It's a stack of pizzas.","response":"DM: Why are you guys so awesome?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You guys are amazing!\nMARISHA: Yeah, what the hell?\nSAM: Do they know the address here? That's kinda creepy.\nLAURA: Ah, thank you! I was wanting some ice tea!\nLIAM: Thanks! Thank you, long list.\nTRAVIS: May your list be ever long, with your– list.","response":"DM: So, best you can ascertain, you've never heard the term mind flayer. But in your people you've heard stories and tales growing up about something referred to as an illithid."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A what?\nSAM: An illithid?\nMARISHA: An illithid.","response":"DM: A nasty entity, from beyond."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Illithid, with a D or a T?","response":"DM: With a D. As far as you know, all that you've heard, is that they were considered ghost stories, as a kid, to keep you from wandering dark caves and spaces. They would take your minds, and you thought this whole time that that was just a fable. That it was just a tale. But you do know that they normally aren't solitary; they usually keep company of a colony."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)\nTRAVIS: Fudge.\nLIAM: Shit.\nMARISHA: But I've never heard them called a mind flayer, but I guess they could be called a mind flayer. But we call them Illithids. I didn't know they were real, though.\nLAURA: What do we do?\nTRAVIS: Why don't we– Listen, when my Herd used to wander through the trees and we came upon a force that was greater than our own, we used the landscape to our ad-van-tage, so why don't we provoke an attack? And then retreat over the bridge.\nSAM: And have them all jump over the edge of the cliff?\nTRAVIS: You said they were all gray-eyed, right?\nLAURA: At least they'll have to go one at a time, or two at a time across the bridge.\nMARISHA: But Scanlan, didn't you also say that they were, like, levitating?\nTRAVIS: What?","response":"DM: The one lengthy creature."}
{"prompt":"SAM: The one lengthy creature was levitating.\nLAURA: Well, I mean, can he fly, or can he levitate?\nSAM: Well yes, but I think what Grog is talking about is the bulk of the fighting force, getting them to follow us over the bridge and then cutting the bridge.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, like in 300. Which was a great puppet show I saw.\nORION: Oh Grog, I heard that, where they used 300 puppets!\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nORION: It's amazing!\nLAURA: Okay, I like this plan.\nLIAM: What if all but a couple of us snuck into one of these buildings and waited and a couple of us made a stink and got a significant number of them to chase across the bridge.\nSAM: That's a good idea.\nLIAM: But then how could we cut the bridge behind? We have a flying carpet so we can go back and forth, but we could drop a significant number of them down into the lava.\nMARISHA: Can we have Tiberius standing there to just Firebolt it?\nTRAVIS: What's the bridge made of?\nSAM: Do you want the rope?\nORION: Wait a minute. We want to bait them, is that what we're trying to do?\nSAM: No, we want to drop the bridge and have them fall to their deaths.\nLAURA: Or, Scanlan–\nSAM: Yes?\nLAURA: Or, what if you let off a stink bomb in the middle of the camp?\nSAM: Well, they would run willy-nilly!\nLAURA: Some of them would try to leave across the bridge.\nSAM: Well remember, there's a tunnel on the other side of camp. They could run that way as well.\nLIAM: It's also a huge, and your stink-cloud is only, you know, 20 or 30 feet across.\nSAM: 20 feet.\nTRAVIS: “Only”.\nORION: How long is the bridge?","response":"DM: The bridge, now that you've traversed it, it's ten feet wide, and runs about a little over 200 feet or 250 feet in length."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You can get a lot of them on that bridge and then cut it.\nORION: True.\nTRAVIS: Makes their numbers count for nothing.\nMARISHA: I think I've heard that one. That puppet show.\nSAM: I like that idea.\nORION: I think I might have a solution.\nLAURA: Yes, Tiberius? Speak your mind.\nORION: I think it's about time I used these.\nTRAVIS: Oh shit.\nORION: For non-combat things. I think we should create a diversion, but let me do it. I can use my deck of illusions to generate any kind of number of sorts of creatures or whatever that I can control. I can simply toss one out, I believe 50 feet ahead of me, and control it and get their attention. I can draw them back through the bridge, using the illusions, taunting them along the way. They, of course, will give chase, because they are (chuckles) idiots. And, as soon as we get enough, we can all– you can hack away at the bridge all you like, Grog. We could both burn it, we could hack and burn.\nTRAVIS: What kind of creatures can you make?\nORION: Well, that's all up to the deck.\nSAM: It's up to the deck, or it's up to you?\nORION: It's up to the deck.\nLAURA: Let's try it!\nSAM: So, what if it's a scary thing that scares them away?\nORION: If I generate something such as– as exquisite as a red dragon, say, I'm sure somebody like the mindfellows– If they do flee, the camp will be empty and we can search it and free the slaves. If not, they will give chase and they will come and bait it. Either way, it works in our favor.\nTRAVIS: Can I test something real quick? If I pull out the magic carpet or I take it back from whoever the fuck had it, and I stand on it, does it hold me up or do I sink?","response":"DM: You get on top of the carpet and you will it to begin to shift, and the carpet around you lifts, but you are anchoring it to the ground."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So this is a big problem.\nLAURA: But you've got Feather Fall. You've got Feather Fall! Is that still a thing?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, which just slows my fall. It doesn't take me across.\nSAM: That might not be a thing anymore.\nORION: I do have Feather Fall.\nLAURA: But Levitate or something– but we could tie a rope to you and it can–\nLIAM: It makes him lighter, yeah.\nLAURA: – it makes you really light, and we can just drag you behind us. Yeah, it'll work.\nSAM: Why do we need to float Grog?\nTRAVIS: If we cut the bridge.\nLAURA: In case we destroy the bridge.\nSAM: Oh.\nORION: Oh, don't worry about that, Grog. I'll just cast Fly on you, because I can fly.\nTRAVIS: You can just Fly me?\nORION: Yes. We can both fly.\nTRAVIS: Okay.\nLAURA: And you can Fly Trinket, too?\nORION: Of course, the bear.\nLAURA: Of course.\nTRAVIS: I'm down for doing this.\nLAURA: Let's do it! Do it!\nMARISHA: Flying from the–\nORION: We have ways across.\nMARISHA: Okay, okay, hang on, hang on.\nTALIESIN: This is a good plan.\nSAM: Wait, wait, wait. Are we–\nMARISHA: So, let's have a failsafe in case a few get across the bridge.\nSAM: Let's also recap which plan we're going with. One of us creating a diversion and running away, or these mystical, magical–\nTRAVIS: I like the mystical, magical–\nSAM: – weird dragon creatures. What if they scare them the other way?\nTALIESIN: It would have to be pretty scary. And then, hey, that works.\nORION: I just said, the path would be clear.\nSAM: What if–\nLIAM: Well, are we scaring them or are we luring them?\nSAM: Also, might I remind–\nORION: It's all up to the deck.\nSAM: We're luring them. And also, might I remind you all, that they're being mind controlled by this, what, illithid–\nTRAVIS: Davy Jones.\nLAURA: I feel like we should try to–\nMARISHA: Illithid.\nSAM: And if the illithid recognizes that your–\nLAURA: Wait, wait!\nSAM: – your things are false, then he's not going to send his men–\nLAURA: That's true.\nSAM: – off to chase them.\nTALIESIN: Or he may send them to kill whoever is creating the illusion.\nORION: Exactly.\nSAM: However, if we were– hm.\nORION: Either way, they're coming for us.\nLAURA: Maybe we could create a distraction and bring them away from the tunnel's entrance and we can just sneak around them. No?\nORION: I mean, did you see a way to do that?\nSAM: What? To sneak through the village to the tunnel? No! Not all seven of us. And a bear. Are you crazy?\nTRAVIS: I'll stay on this side of the bridge, who wants to go be a distraction? Who wants to be the bait? Who's real fast?\nSAM: Wait, are we doing his bait or are we doing a real bait?\nTRAVIS: I don't–\nORION: We can try both.\nTRAVIS: What if you cast something big and they turn it against us? That could suck.\nORION: Oh!\nSAM: It's fake. It's just a hologram.\nLAURA: It's not–\nORION: It's an illusion that I control.\nTRAVIS: How about we throw one of those and send–\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: How about 50/50 it? One fake, one real. One of us, one of the cards.\nLIAM: I'll go.\nTRAVIS: Somebody be Gambit and throw that bitch.\nMARISHA: We really just need someone to keep them from running through that tunnel.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: We need some way to keep them from coming– going–\nLAURA: Can you send a card that looks like a dragon on the other side, in the tunnel, and then they run towards us.\nMARISHA: Oh, oh, oh! Wait, wait.\nTRAVIS: What's wrong with them running away from us?\nSAM: Oh, snap.\nMARISHA: I actually have a spell, while I was reading through my book last night, catching up on spells that I kinda forgot about. I learned something called Hallucinatory Terrain, where I can make the entire terrain look like whatever I want.\nSAM: Other terrain or an animal?\nMARISHA: Other terrain.\nTRAVIS: They're mind controlled–\nMARISHA: What I can do, is–\nLAURA: You can make the chasm look like it's solid ground!\nSAM: Can you make the chasm look like it's solid ground?\nTRAVIS: Ooh!\nMARISHA: I can make the chasm look like it's solid ground–\nSAM: Can she do this?","response":"DM: She can try."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes!\nTRAVIS: I like it!\nMARISHA: I can make the tunnel across the way look like it's caved in.\nLAURA: Make the big chasm look like solid ground. They'll fall off the edge!\nTALIESIN: That's a great plan.\nLIAM: That's a great idea, but let's–\nORION: I'll throw the illusion on the fake lands.\nSAM: Is gonna see through that.\nLIAM: – is going to see through it. So if we've got one real half-elf in the mix, he'll focus on me. So I'll take the flying carpet and tie it around my back.\nLAURA: You better run fast and not get taken!\nLIAM: I have boots of haste.\nMARISHA: Are you good with hauling ass?\nLIAM: Mm?\nMARISHA: Okay. As long as you can haul ass.\nLIAM: So I take the rug from Grog–\nTRAVIS: Yep.\nLIAM: I'm gonna roll it up and I tie it, I have a rope to tie it to my back.\nLAURA: It's a big rug on your back.\nTRAVIS: Saddle up, let's do it.","response":"DM: It's a very big rug."}

We're hoping that they're gonna just fall off the edge instead.\nORION: Run off the bridge–\nTRAVIS: They go, (yells)\nSAM: Which side are we gonna chop it on? Our side or their side?\nTRAVIS: Once he gets back to our side.\nLAURA: Our side!\nSAM: Okay.\nTRAVIS: (yells) They come back, everybody falls in–\nLIAM: What's the bridge made of?

How high is it?\nSAM: – to inspire them.\nMARISHA: You have the advantage–\nLIAM: Advantage.\nMARISHA: – on all dex rolls.\nMARISHA: If that comes to that.\nLIAM: That's great, because that's how I attack.","response":"DM: Well, advantage on dex ability checks."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.\nMARISHA: Ability checks.","response":"DM: Like acrobatics, things like that, sleight of hand, stealth."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, yes, I'll sing an inspiration song for both of them.","response":"DM: Okay, so–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (sings) Hey baby, hey baby, hey!\nLIAM: But we need to–\nSAM: (sings) Dwarves say. Dwarves say.\nSAM: (sings) Hey baby, hey baby, hey! On to the bridge and fall down.\nTRAVIS: Was that Gwen Stefani?","response":"DM: So, inspiration dice to Vax, and who else?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I hope this works.","response":"DM: Vax and who else? Gets inspiration dice? Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I'm sorry, these two– Grog and Vax.","response":"DM: Okay. So both of you guys have a d8 of inspiration dice you can spend."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh! Are you going too?\nLAURA: Yeah, no, Grog isn't going, Tiberius is going.\nSAM: I'm sorry. Tiberius and Vax, then.","response":"DM: Okay. There you go."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You could have gave it to me.\nLIAM: But, Tiberius, walk on a bit behind me, and I'm gonna walk up to the edge of town, and I'm gonna chat.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my god. What if you– What!","response":"DM: So, before this happens, where's everyone placed? You guys–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, where are you guys–\nLAURA: Oh my God.","response":"DM: You guys are across the bridge."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: Where's the rest of you?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm gonna set up on our side of the bridge, I'm gonna set up the Bad News gun and get ready to train it on whatever might try and come across.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are there any big rock formations that I can sort of use as a shelter and kind of stay behind that but also peek around?","response":"DM: About 20 feet off from the edge, on the goblin side, there is one outcropping of, like, a large stalagmite that you could probably get behind."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, on the goblin side?","response":"DM: On the goblin side. Oh, do you wanna be on their side?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I want to be on our side.","response":"DM: Your side, meaning the side that the war camp is on."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No. I thought we were all on the other side of the bridge.\nSAM: We're gonna stay on the side that doesn't have all the bad guys on it.","response":"DM: Right. There's the goblin side, which is where you guys first went through, there's the bridge, and then there's the war camp side."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and TRAVIS: Goblin side.\nTRAVIS: Yep.","response":"DM: Goblin side for Percy, setting up the Bad News, your crazy gun."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh yeah.\nLAURA: You're on the war camp side\nTALIESIN: Gonna be great.","response":"DM: And Scanlan as well."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right, and I'm gonna run that, but you guys are all going back to–\nLAURA: We're on the goblin side.\nLIAM: The safer side. The further side.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: I'm gonna be– Can I be like halfway in between on the bridge? Is that a bad idea?","response":"DM: You can do that. It's up to you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Go for it! You can fly.\nLAURA: Can she fly?","response":"DM: Turn into birds."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can turn into a bird.","response":"DM: She's a druid."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! You can turn into a bird!\nTRAVIS: Yeah. She's fine.\nLAURA: How long does your spell cast? I mean, your spell last?\nTRAVIS: (snickers)\nLAURA: Shut up.\nMARISHA: My– which one?\nLAURA: Your illusion spell.\nMARISHA: It's a concentration thing. So, as long as I can keep it up.\nLAURA: So, maybe you should do that–\nMARISHA: Oh. Yeah, for up to 30– 24 hours, actually. It's not a concentration spell.\nLAURA: So, how far does it reach?\nMARISHA: 300 feet.\nLAURA: Okay.\nMARISHA: 150 square feet.","response":"DM: Right. Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just needs to–\nMARISHA: And it looks, sounds–\nLIAM: – work around the edge of the bridge.\nMARISHA: – smells, like some other sort of natural terrain.","response":"DM: So, what are you going to make the terrain look like? What is your alteration?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So, what I'm doing, whenever we– can I make it look like there's a cave-in happening through the tunnel?\nLAURA: (whispers) Wait! No! Make it look like it's really far–\nLIAM: Keyleth, what if you fudged it so the cliff–\nMARISHA: Well, that's what I'm gonna do.\nLIAM: – looked like it went 30 feet further out.\nMARISHA: Yeah. What I'm gonna do, I just want the terrain to look, on my side–\nLIAM: Close to what they're used to.\nMARISHA: I want the terrain to look exactly like what it is, but I just wanna stretch it out a little bit, so it looks like they've got, like, an extra running space.","response":"DM: Okay, okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, so if it looks too different–","response":"DM: So like an additional 40 or so feet out from the actual–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes. Of actual, yes. Like the bridge is an extra 40 feet away.","response":"DM: Okay. The actual ceiling is maybe about 120 feet up, so it might be a little hard to do that, and cause a cave-in-type illusion."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Then I'll do that. Then I'm gonna just– you know what, I'm gonna stay on the opposite side of the bridge, and I'm gonna focus on making that illusion.","response":"DM: Okay. Cool. So you go ahead and you cast Hallucinatory Terrain–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yep.\nLAURA: (yells)","response":"DM: You now see an additional 40 feet of the cliff stretching out–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It looks very realistic.\nMARISHA: Thank you!","response":"DM: And you can actually see that the bridge looks attached to it, it's a very, very convincing illusion. And you kind of have to remind yourself that it's an illusion, just so you don't fall for it either!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes, be careful guys, please be careful!\nMARISHA: Mm-hm.","response":"DM: – on the other side– outside of the bridge."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm out with them.","response":"DM: Okay. So you're off the bridge now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Gone. Yeah.\nLIAM: Okay. Tiberius, you wait here, ready to run. I take Tiberius by the arm like this. Vox Machina.\nORION: Vox Machina.\nLIAM: Okay. So I stealthily walk up to the closing distance to the edge of town and I stand there. I click my boots of haste together.\nLAURA: Oh god.\nORION: As he runs off I cast Greater Invisibility on myself.\nORION: I cast Fly on myself and I hover.","response":"DM: Both of those are concentration spells."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Fuck!","response":"DM: You can only have one of those up at any given point in time."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'll cast Fly, then.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes.","response":"DM: So you're now floating up. Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.\nORION: And I'm at enough edge to where her illusions are, as well.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: But over the bridge just in case I fall.\nLIAM: I just clicked the boots.","response":"DM: You feel the sudden surge of magical energy through your body like adrenaline just pumping into your system."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I cry out full voice, listen up, you walking prawn, doom has come for you today. Step forth, you slimy bastard.\nLAURA: Oh fuck.\nORION: As he does that I toss out three cards.\nLAURA: Oh gosh.\nLIAM: Your trolls can't save you.\nORION: Right at the rim of where the illusion stops.\nLAURA: I will find you.\nLIAM: No matter how far or how long.\nTRAVIS: We should call this a rim job.\nORION: Yes.\nLIAM: Oh Jesus.\nLAURA: Oh god.\nTALIESIN: This is a good plan.\nSAM: You got your dice?\nTRAVIS: Sure it is.\nLIAM: It's a great plan.\nSAM: Use your dice.\nMARISHA: Are you convincing yourself or are you–\nTALIESIN: This is a good plan.\nTRAVIS: We're on the safe side with Bad News and me.\nTALIESIN: We're fine.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I'm with you guys. We're fine.","response":"DM: So currently one of the cards bursts and you can see rising up from its energy this awful-looking humanoid skeletal undead creature with long golden red robes, with this gnarled gold crown and these glowing blue eyes and just pure arcane energy across this horribly gnarled skeletal face."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay.","response":"DM: There stands this hideous-looking lich cackling to itself."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ah, the ace of spades– two of spades, it changed, dammit. Looking at Pathfinder right now.\nORION: Two of spades.\nLIAM: Tiberius, can we hit it and quit it?\nLAURA: What are the other ones?","response":"DM: The other one (poof) and you see before you a kind of –"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Flip them over, they have good graphics on the cover.","response":"DM: It's nice. Through the smoke, you see what looks like some sort of a human kind of long, long-fighting warrior, grizzled, ready to fight, has a big old longsword out, armored up in scalemail, one eye is kinda wounded, and he just kinda sits there and growls with his blade ready. The third card. From the smoke appears a red-skinned dragonborn with long blue robes and a staff with a glowing beam of light on it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes.\nORION: Oh. It must be a joker.","response":"DM: You see an exact duplicate of Tiberius now standing there as the three illusions stand."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Outstanding.\nMARISHA: That's perfect.","response":"DM: Your cards are now spent, correct?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Uh, no, they exist until I dispel them.","response":"DM: Right, but I mean the actual cards don't go back in the deck."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, they do.\nMARISHA: Come here, bitches","response":"DM: About 20 seconds pass. And then you start hearing this (boom boom boom boom). It sounds like a drum beat."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my god.\nSAM: Cut the rope, cut the rope.\nLAURA: Not yet, not yet, not yet.\nSAM: Leave Vax there, let's go.","response":"DM: At this point, you now see about 16 duergar come running out from the center of town, armored, weapons drawn, a few with crossbows, two trolls and an ogre charging out. You see the ogres holding this giant– it looks like a stone slab for one of its clubs, and the two trolls just come with their claws open, rushing right towards you and the illusions."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my gosh.\nLIAM: I start flipping–\nORION: I command the lich to start doing one of his glowy spells, and, like, through him, I go: (whispers) Come for us, your death awaits.\nLIAM: And I flip the double birds and start walking backwards a little bit.\nSAM: Oh yes, that's even better!\nMARISHA: Just watch your step!\nLIAM: Yes, straight back.\nORION: I command the soldier to start swinging his sword.","response":"DM: As you're stepping back, four of the duergar immediately take, using their inertia, pull and release javelins in your direction."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.\nLAURA: Oh god!\nLAURA: Oh gosh.\nLIAM: My AC is 19.\nLIAM: I'm gonna use Uncanny Dodge. For anything I can see, I can dodge for half damage, if I need to.\nLIAM: Shit, okay.\nORION: Oh.","response":"DM: The other hits you for a total of eight damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is that the halved or–?\nORION: Total.","response":"DM: No, well, you can choose to half one. It's up to you, you choose which one. Probably the higher one."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so, it was 11 and eight?","response":"DM: So it would be six."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, six and eight, okay, 14.","response":"DM: 14 points of damage with these just javelins hitting you like, oh, that's right. They have range!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right, I knew this was coming.\nLAURA: Right!","response":"DM: You can immediately see one of the trolls goes and just lunges forward and slashes the lich, just passing through its form."}
{"prompt":"ORION: He lunges at the lich?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sweet!","response":"DM: It went through, it kinda loses its footing for a second, stops and kinda looks angry, turns and starts slashing at it again."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Run! Run away!\nSAM: – fake ground.\nORION: And I'm like–\nMARISHA: Yeah, isn't he on the fake ground? The lich?\nORION: Yes, yeah, he's like right at the edge.","response":"DM: Yeah, right at the precipice."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I can't throw my card on the fake ground. They'd fall.","response":"DM: Yeah, so the troll kind of steps forward–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: They're right at the edge, though.\nLAURA: (gasps)\nALL: Yes!\nSAM: The troll?","response":"DM: That was the troll, just (falling sounds). The ogre goes running forward, right towards you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I command the–\nLIAM: Yes?","response":"DM: Just their speed, they're just the first ones to get there. Duergar have tiny legs."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (high-pitched voice) Where's the roll for initiative, man?\nLAURA: You're already back, you're at the bridge!","response":"DM: This is what I'm saying, what are you doing? This is your reactionary part. We're just taking– this isn't a battle, this is–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I'm backing it up, I'm running, man.\nLAURA: Badass!","response":"DM: You hear them screaming as they tumble into the darkness."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Didn't occur to me that there is a bridge–","response":"DM: About four duergar also go spilling over the side, screaming as they tumble into the darkness."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes!","response":"DM: The rest of them stop, kind of look around and–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: This was a great plan!\nORION: I start– as that's happening, I start to pull back and float away and I'm commanding all of my guys to come through the bridge. Because I can command them within 30 feet. So they're now, they're all within 30 feet of me, retreating as well.","response":"DM: Okay. As this is happening, you can now see some of the members of the duergar that are now at the edge are some of the elite guard, with the blackened armor you saw. They both kinda step forward and put their foot out, feeling for purchase, give a nod, pull out their swords, and start hacking at the bridge immediately."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (gasps) Oh shit.\nLAURA: Shit.\nLAURA: Can we– does our aim reach? Our ranged\nattacks, do they reach?\nSAM: (whispers) You, fly?\nTRAVIS: No, he's got it.\nLAURA: Do ranged attacks reach?","response":"DM: From this distance, it's gonna be a serious penalty."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: You've got advantage!","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, good.\nLIAM: Okay, good, because the first roll was a\none. The second roll was a 19.\nORION: Yes!\nLIAM: Plus! Plus, plus, plus nine is 28.\nTRAVIS: Oh my god!

{"prompt":"LIAM: So that's– what is it, I've never done that? That's–","response":"DM: It's at the top of your sheet of your stats, above your stats, on the right of your stats. Oh, it's your wisdom saving."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wisdom, okay.","response":"DM: Wisdom."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ow, not very good. Seven.","response":"DM: Seven."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No!","response":"DM: As you are running, you get the carpet out, you leap onto it and your whole sense and awareness of your surroundings just fades from you. You just feel your entire body going numb for a second and you just feel yourself falling."}

{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! Oh bother! Shoo! I go get him!\nLIAM: 29 dex save right down the toilet.","response":"DM: You go and swoop down, fly. You manage to–"}

{"prompt":"ORION: Very good. I go just to touch him, I am not trying to pull him up.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What? Try to grab him! Try to grab him!\nLIAM: Fly, he can fly me.\nSAM: He is falling!\nORION: He is falling. Fly!\nLIAM: Like Superman.\nORION: Now fly, damn it.","response":"DM: He is still just kind of standing there, not doing anything. As you finish casting the Fly spell, your Fly spell dissipates because it's a concentration spell and you can have one at a given time."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wait, you're unconscious?\nLIAM: I don't know what I am.\nORION: I ask right now, is he–\nMARISHA: He's like catatonic.\nORION: He is, okay. Then I don't do that, because you can't fly yourself, so I do grab him, this time.","response":"DM: Okay, you grab him as his whole weight goes onto you. What's your strength?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh my god.\nLIAM: It has been nice knowing you, ladies and gentlemen.\nORION: 12.\nLAURA: No, no, no.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an athletics check."}

You rush down, diving, you grab the back of his armor. As you yank up on him, you manage to just pull him across and get him to the other edge. The flying carpet, however, has plummeted down in–"}
{"prompt":"ALL: No!\nTRAVIS: Son of a bitch.\nLAURA: You lost our flying carpet, you unconscious bastard!","response":"DM: However, Tiberius swoops up. You guys just see them both plummet into darkness and then flying up at the edge of the crevasse on your side, Tiberius clutching your brother, currently just staring off into space and dropping him down with a dull sound."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Vax!","response":"DM: The bridge slaps onto the side of the cavern."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Mawp.\nLAURA: And I run over to Vax.\nLIAM: Mawp.\nLAURA: And I'm like trying to figure out what's wrong with him.\nTRAVIS: The magic carpet is done?","response":"DM: It just disappeared into the darkness below."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!\nTRAVIS: (tearfully) I have to erase it.\nMARISHA: Bye, carpet.\nTALIESIN: No.\nSAM: That was our ticket across the chasm.\nLIAM: Yes.\nMARISHA: I loved that carpet, damn it.","response":"DM: About a minute passes or so, you come back to your senses."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, good.\nLIAM: I got to get the carpet.\nTALIESIN: Can I clean my gun?\nORION: I slap him with Mage Hand. Snap out of it!\nLIAM: What happened? What happened?\nTRAVIS: Wait, do we leave or–\nLAURA: No, wait–\nTALIESIN: They are still across there, aren't they?","response":"DM: You can see across the way that there are a bunch of them just standing at the edge."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I wanna take a shot at the–\nLAURA: At the–\nLIAM: Noodle-face, yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, man!\nSAM: You can see them and they control you.\nLAURA: Right in the noggin.\nLIAM: Shoot it in the eye, man.\nORION: Not from that distance, I don't think. His sniper rifle goes far.\nTALIESIN: Hm, that's a 23.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and roll the damage. Across the way you can hear the resounding (gunshot)."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ah, yeah! That don't suck! 20 points of damage.","response":"DM: 20 points of damage! Nice. You just see this blast of red and flame across the way and the figure is just knocked off its feet, about ten feet back."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can you shoot him again?\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nMARISHA: It's just a carnival game for Percy at this point.","response":"DM: At this point in time you can now see the duergar looking up and backing away from the cliff side."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: You come to the bridge, which is just dangling off the side now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're on the goblin side, now?\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: You're on the goblin side and the bridge is just dangling down into darkness."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That felt pretty good, too.\nLIAM: Who wants to have a picnic?\nORION: I mean, seriously.\nMARISHA: So how many (monster sounds) are ove there?","response":"DM: You only saw the one."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And how many duergar left? How many–\nORION: Yes, how many are left after all that?\nMARISHA: After they fell into–","response":"DM: After all that, you saw a few more kind of filter out from the town, you have probably about 25 visible at that moment that have all backed."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to hang on him visually and I'm gonna wait to take another shot until he tries to stand up again.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So if he tries to stand up again, I want to shoot him again.\nLAURA: But wait, you can shoot him while he's on the ground! Can't you?\nTALIESIN: That's so much more fun to wait.","response":"DM: You can shoot him, but it's at disadvantage to shoot someone who's prone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's on the ground?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Technically, he's got cover. And it's funnier to just wait.","response":"DM: A moment passes and he kind of drifts back up. Take another shot."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Taking another shot.\nMARISHA: Come on, Percy.\nLIAM: Come on, baby.\nTALIESIN: He's such an asshole.\nMARISHA: Like fish in a barrel.\nLIAM: Come on, Von Rolo!\nTALIESIN: 15.","response":"DM: 15? Unfortunately, it does not hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (ricochet noise)","response":"DM: At that distance, with the darkness, it's very hard to get your bead on him at that point. So you (gunshot), fires off, you can now see it drift away–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fudge!","response":"DM: – and all the rest of the duergar are now retreating into the city."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Man!\nLAURA: What're you gonna do? All of our shit's gone.\nMARISHA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Okay. What're we gonna do? Leave?\nLAURA: Maybe we can– can we walk up and see–\nORION: Let's take a short rest.\nLAURA: – if we can find another bridge?\nORION: While we're figuring this out.","response":"DM: If you want to. Okay. So you walk over to the edge, and you kind of look across to the sides. Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll assist.\nLAURA: Oh, 20!\nLIAM: 20.\nTALIESIN: Never mind!\nLAURA: No, no assistance needed.","response":"DM: Natural 20?"}

{"prompt":"LAURA & LIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: Plus–"}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. We have an infinite rope!\nMARISHA: Oh! Go!\nLAURA: We have infinite rope! I'm gonna tie it to myself–\nORION: Wait, hold on a second–\nTALIESIN: We're gonna lower you down.\nORION: Is it still– it's just at the end of the– all the way down there?","response":"DM: Mm-hm."}

{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, watch out for that warm air, whatever that was.","response":"DM: So."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ooh. You're right. I take out an empty bottle while I do this.\nLAURA: (gasps) It's water down there?\nMARISHA and SAM: It's water?","response":"DM: It appears to be some sort of water surface below you. About 150 feet down."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I thought there was lava–\nTRAVIS: I run and jump off the cliff!","response":"DM: There are streaks of lava–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No you don't.","response":"DM: – pouring, like from the ceiling and portions of the wall–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yep, and I jumped all the way down.\nLAURA: It's 1,000 feet down.","response":"DM: – but it's all just kind of pouring down and pooling at the edges and then cooling."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's 1,000 feet.\nLIAM: That's a big belly flop.\nTRAVIS: I have great form in mid-air.\nSAM: So there, it's a river–\nORION: And you don't know this yet.\nLAURA: Do you want to die?","response":"DM: And you can see the waterfall, it's cascading over the side–"}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't. Dive. 1,000 fucking feet.\nORION: Waterfall. Ah! I retrieve the magic carpet.","response":"DM: You grab the magic carpet, you roll it up, make your way back up to the surface."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Carpet!\nORION: Ah, here you are. By the way, cool stuff down there. It's actually not lava, it's water! Aha. Believe it or not.\nLAURA: Water? How far down from the bridge?\nORION: It's about 150 feet from the bridge, but it's about 1,000 feet down all the way. We could traverse down, somehow, and I think it would be a nice place to go explore.\nSAM: Place to go explore?\nORION: Especially because we have nothing else to do, and–\nSAM: Well, we could go to the camp and go kick some–\nLAURA: Well, look, we know– we can't get over there.\nSAM: But we have a carpet now!\nORION: Oh, that's right.\nLAURA: Oh.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, but we go over one at a time and then we're waiting for–\nMARISHA: Ah, fly me down with you.\nLAURA: The thing is–\nSAM: The three of us can fly.\nMARISHA: Tiberius and I are going to fly down.\nLAURA: The thing is, we know that–\nMARISHA: On the carpet.\nLAURA: – deeper down is where they've gone.\nMARISHA: Yes. That's true.\nLAURA: So probably it'd be best to go down. We could have avoided all of this bullshit if we'd just have known–\nLIAM: But we didn't know, and if there's–\nMARISHA: I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight that guy.\nLIAM: – if there's more than one of them these, though, he's gone boodle-oodle-ooo to his friends right now, I mean–\nLAURA: Right.\nLIAM: – if we can it'd be good to put this guy in the ground.\nSAM: I'm all for going–\nMARISHA: I don't know. Okay, take me down–\nSAM: There's a tunnel back there–\nMARISHA: Hang on, let me, let's go see, let's go see.\nSAM: – back, past that village, that they're protecting.\nORION: Well, I'm still flying, you can take– Percy, would you like to come?\nMARISHA: I've– to ride the carpet down to the bottom with Percy and Tiberius.\nORION: Well, I– whoever's going down should be on the carpet, 'cause I can still fly.\nMARISHA: Right.\nORION: So, I don't need it.\nMARISHA: Me and Percy are on the carpet.\nMARISHA: Do I see any tunnels, or areas that look like it leads someplace of interest?","response":"DM: As you look down, there is definitely a large pool of water that leads off into a few other underground rivers that spill off into the mountainside itself. There are sections of the wall where lava is pouring out, where there seems to be some sort of a vent or some sort of opening into some magma reserve, and there are about three of them that are pouring out, and kind of drifting down. One of them is pooling and cooling as it hits the water, and it's just kind of this perpetually glowing mass of slow-growing rock. There also appears to be one that is just continuing to flow that leads, kind of, back in the direction where you guys came, but underneath. There's one big lava pool that is spilling, and then kind of giving a little bit of light to the inside of a tunnel that continues further down at a decline. The opposite side–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Lava tunnels? What, are you crazy?\nMARISHA: I keep going.\nSAM: Sorry, yes?","response":"DM: That's okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Are you done?","response":"DM: On the opposite side, you can see there's a small outcropping and a smaller waterfall that is pouring out of the side of the mountain, like another sea is now meeting the river underneath, and that is just kind of cascading out from the side of the rock, dropping about 30 or 40 feet, and hitting the edge of the rock pool."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nLIAM: On Cthulhu's side, you're talking about?","response":"DM: On Cthulhu's side. Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I think we should–\nMARISHA: I say, Tiberius, give me some light?\nORION: Oh!\nMARISHA: And I take– and I cast Control Water, and I just take the pool– the water in the bottom of the pool, and I bend it, and I part the pool, and I take it and I cascade it all the way up, following the lava flows.","response":"DM: Okay. Just so you're aware, the pool is about 600 feet across."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can part seas with this.","response":"DM: Right. So you can part elements of it, but"}
{"prompt":"like, it is a large, large, large body of water.","response":"DM: Okay, another thing you notice, is there are two trolls and an ogre currently trying to stay afloat, as one of them just (sucking sound) gets pulled under the water."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Gets pulled under?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (yells)","response":"DM: You begin moving the water to the sides and you begin to cool some of the lava flows."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, that's awesome.","response":"DM: You can see the glowing red magma begin to cool to a dark black and become solid. As it does you can see parts of it crack, as the magma's still pushing out. But you're definitely staunching the flow."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm gonna kind of push it, you said there was a tunnel kind of going up into Cthulhu side?","response":"DM: Yeah, there is a tunnel that seemed– the opening leads to the back, and there's a waterfall that is pouring out from that side."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Waterfall.\nMARISHA: There's a waterfall.","response":"DM: Waterfall."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Not a lava fall.","response":"DM: The lava flow is going down the opposite direction."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But there's like a tunnel kind of carving out that way?","response":"DM: Yeah. Like a large opening that continues further down."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I take all of the water, and I really just concentrate, and I gather just a big tube, and I push it down that tunnel.","response":"DM: Okay, so the best– the water that you gather from this, you force into a quick geyser in that direction. As it sprays across the front, you can see it begins to cool some of the magma. It's a pretty hefty flow, you manage to slow it, and you do cool parts of it, but it's gonna be difficult and take you a while, if you're just constantly pushing water on it, to give the flow any sort of serious stop. You notice the lava flow doesn't coat the entire floor of the tunnel, just a side of it. It's almost like there's some portion of it that is walkable, adjacent to the lava."}
{"prompt":"ORION: We can also go in the not-lava cave, Keyleth.\nMARISHA: I'm sorry, that lava cave just looks important.\nORION: I know. Because of the lava.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nORION: Let's go tell the others what we've found, and then we'll come back and decide which way to go.\nMARISHA: Okay, okay.\nTALIESIN: Sometimes a lava cave is just a lava cave.\nORION: I fly back up.","response":"DM: Okay."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait, but we're gonna have to go down eventually, so.\nLIAM: Maybe.\nSAM: Why?\nLAURA: Okay.\nSAM: Why do we have to go down there, there's nothing that we need down there!\nORION: But across the way is a 25-man battle with a huge, nasty boss.\nSAM: There's seven of us and one of us is Grog!\nLAURA: Well, everybody keeps saying that everything is deeper and deeper, so I think we're gonna have to go–\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nLAURA: – deep down. Eventually.\nMARISHA: I agree with Vex on this one.\nLIAM: Well, hold on.\nSAM: Deep into the tunnels.\nLIAM: All those assholes are still standing on the edge across there. Do we have– we've flown out of a falling tower before, we were all able to do it, can we just fly up and over those shitheads and go towards the tunnel?\nORION: Not with the eye of that mind flayer.\nLAURA: Yeah. It can grab us.\nMARISHA: Yeah, look what it did to you!\nORION: I don't trust it.\nLAURA: Exactly.\nLIAM: Can't we go 150 feet in the air, and–\nLAURA: The tunnel doesn't go that high.\nMARISHA: I think you were at least 150 feet across that bridge when he did that to you.\nLAURA: Yeah. It can grab us from there.\nSAM: We can try–\nLIAM: I was on the bridge when that happened–","response":"DM: You were on the bridge when that happened, you were–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: – and fell down. I wasn't way above.\nMARISHA: But the bridge was like 250 feet across, right?","response":"DM: Right. You were about, loosely, 80 feet across when it got you."}

{"prompt":"LIAM: We can go–\nLAURA: But the tunnel, oh–\nTALIESIN: They have ranged weapons as well.\nLAURA: (quietly) I think we should go down!\nSAM: But what is down there?\nTRAVIS: If we don't find out.\nLAURA: Kima!\nTRAVIS: You can drop me like a depth charge.\nSAM: But there's no sign of anything intelligent down there, other than something that's eating trolls underwater. It could be just giant whales down there! We have no idea! There's no sign of humans at all! It's lava and death animals!\nLAURA: Maybe, okay. If I go down there–\nORION: There's more like tunnels, that go further–\nLAURA: – and look in one of the tunnels–\nMARISHA: Tunnels that go deeper!\nLAURA: – can I look in one of the tunnels and see if I find tracks? If I do, can we go that way?\nSAM: How're you gonna go in the tunnels?\nLAURA: I've got a flying carpet!\nSAM: There's lava!\nLAURA: There's tunnels that don't have lava flowing into them.\nSAM: If you burn–\nMARISHA: And I can control water for at least an hour.\nORION: There's, so, down there, there's a big pool of water–\nMARISHA: It lasts a while.\nORION: – a tunnel going towards the mind flayer side, with no lava–\nLAURA: Exactly!\nORION: – and then there's another cave with lava–\nLAURA: There is a tunnel that we can walk in.\nORION: – that we can go, going away from him.\nTALIESIN: Let's see if there's anything resembling tracks–\nLAURA: Yes!\nMARISHA: I'll go with Vex that-a-way. I can cool lava as we go.\nLAURA: Please, Scanlan, let me look for tracks.

Anyway, that's none of your business.\nSAM: Are you a communist?\nORION: I don't know what that means!\nLIAM: Now. Tiberius can fly, Keyleth is an eagle who can carry a gnome, and maybe my sister?\nLAURA: Ugh, no.\nLIAM: And that leaves Percy and Grog and I on the flying carpet. Can it hold our weight?

You took our carpet?\nORION: Oh yes, because they need it to get down here as well.\nORION: I was–\nMARISHA: No, we were scouting.\nLAURA: I'm just looking for tracks right now, Tiberius.\nORION: Yeah and I followed you, saw what was going on, took your carpet, and I'm giving it back to them.\nLAURA: Oh my god.","response":"DM: So as you guys are–"}

{"prompt":"Okay, well, go ahead and roll– this would be survival for tracking? Just to get an idea for anything around you see.\nLAURA: 16.","response":"DM: You do see some scratches into the mud of the surface there that lead into a tunnel. You see drag marks, you see footprints, and that's the best you can make out at this in this point in time. But the footprints appear to be dwarven, or dwarf-sized in nature."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see what the scratch marks look like? If they look like any type of beast I might recognize.","response":"DM: The scratch marks are across the ground, it looks just like fingers being pulled through."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: We have the light, remember, when I–","response":"DM: So you take a lantern and put it inside. The tunnel goes back about 25 feet and then stops. It's just a little alcove. You see within the tunnel a series of skeletons or bodies that are partially decomposed."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh. God.","response":"DM: And you see what looks like a pile of rags in the corner."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Go check it out.\nLAURA: So we can either run or loot. What should we do?\nTRAVIS: No, go check it out, ladies.\nSAM: They're not gonna find anything.\nMARISHA: They're telling us not to be stupid because we don't have support. Should we be stupid?\nTRAVIS: Grog says yes.\nLAURA: Oh, I'm so scared, but okay, here's the thing, I remember another situation very similar to this.\nORION: It was terrible.\nLAURA: And it was the lair of one of those umber hulks.\nMARISHA: Right. Why don't we just go back maybe to the entrance of the–\nLIAM: Vex'ahlia, what is going on down there?\nTRAVIS: No no no no. Be thorough.\nLAURA: Oh brother, I think we found the lair of the umber hulk\nTRAVIS: Are you sure?\nLAURA: Oh, pretty damn sure.","response":"DM: It's very– well, the actual tunnel is maybe about five to eight feet across and it would not be able to fit an umber hulk."}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN and LAURA: Oh God. Oh.","response":"DM: –what you do notice is, the walls are solid. This appears to have been carved out over time. And as you move in, you begin to see the rags, and the pile of rags is less a pile of rags and more some sort of humanoid curled up in on the inside. Unconscious, asleep, or dead. Not moving."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What is she– what do they look like?","response":"DM: You can't tell from here. It's just like kind of curled over in the corner."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Go in there.\nTALIESIN: I'd like to roll a save against smugness really quickly. Can I save against smugness? I feel a wave of smugness in here.","response":"DM: I think you might. You're not saved against smugness, Percy."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: What if you turn into something big enough that it can carry me, I hop on your back and we throw something at it? And then fly away.","response":"DM: While you guys are having this conversation, 'cause you're talking to each other–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fuck. We were talking really quietly.","response":"DM: – the thing in the corner kind of rouses and shoots up out of sudden fear movement, looking about. You see, dressed in rags– you guys are seeing this for the first time, but it's familiar. Smooth head, purplish and blue in color, a series of tentacles in its mouth. A giant scar drawn across one of its eyes, and it looks filthy, and it looks desperate. And just looks at the two of you and you hear a sudden voice in your minds."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh fuck!","response":"DM: No movement, just conversation, saying, “What, who are you?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I drop to my knees and I look at him and just say, it's okay, we're friends.","response":"DM: He puts up a hand like this and you see there's a flicker of arcane energy and a barrier appears between you and this creature. And just looks."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I take my Druidcraft and I just make a little flower.\nLAURA: Oh my God.\nMARISHA: And there's a pretty little tulip and I lay it at the edge of the barrier.\nLIAM: (Gollum voice) Nasty.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: With disadvantage? Okay. Nine.","response":"DM: Okay, nine total?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.\nMARISHA: I'm not a very charismatic person.","response":"DM: It holds its place, and the voice again hits your mind and says, “How did you find me? What is your purpose here?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I fly back down.\nTRAVIS: No, no, no!\nLAURA: We don't mean to disturb you, great sire.","response":"DM: “You will die if you try anything.”"}

{"prompt":"LAURA: We mean to help you! We mean to find our way out, and find our friend. That's all.\nMARISHA: We don't want to die either.\nLAURA: Please. Who did this to you? We can help you.\nMARISHA: Let's not die together.","response":"DM: You can see as you get a better look at it, it definitely has a large scar across part of its face, and it looks to be wearing remnants of a robe similar to what Scanlan was describing. However, it is tattered, it's dirtied, sullied by the elements and god knows what other liquids. It also has this strange kind of metallic skull cap that's currently placed around its head. And it just, “Leave me in peace, then, or give me a reason not to slay you where you stand.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (whispers) Revenge.\nLAURA: We can help you get revenge against your brethren who did this to you.","response":"DM: There's a slight change in mood, you just feel. “Revenge?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Roll the shit out of that new dice.\nMARISHA: Come on, Vex.\nLAURA: 19?\nORION: Yes!","response":"DM: The barrier flickers and dissipates. It reaches over and grabs what looks like a gnarled stick. Pulls itself up onto its legs, now what looked like a small minuscule creature is now, even in his terrible hunched form, is standing extremely tall, like scraping the top of this maybe eight-foot-tall ceiling in this tunnel."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (meekly) Hi.","response":"DM: It takes a step forward and says, “Revenge? You speak of revenge. This is a language I wish to know very well.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You found the right motley crew.\nLAURA: Should we bring it with us?\nMARISHA: Would you like to come with us?\nLAURA: To leave this cavern?\nMARISHA: Meet our friends? We have friends.","response":"DM: It kind of gives you both a look and you hear this– There's a slight lurching to it as it gives this horrible guttural– (low chuckle) “Friends? That's a word I haven't heard in a long time. Not one I take to heart, but allies, in time, that I can understand. Take me to your allies.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Tiberius?\nORION: Mm, yes?\nLAURA: Maybe you can send that fucking carpet back down.\nORION: I'll be right there, I was trying to get the rest of the party here, but everyone's being buttholes. I fly back down with the carpet.","response":"DM: You come down with the carpet. At the edge of this opening, you see Keyleth, you see Vex, both emerge with a horrible tentacle-faced gnarled being with a staff coming out with them."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hello?\nMARISHA: Tiberius–\nORION: Oh, did you make a friend?\nMARISHA: We did! See! Friends!\nORION: Wonderful!\nMARISHA: This is– What's your name?","response":"DM: Looks about to you, then looks at Tiberius and says, ignoring your question, “You have persuasion to the arcane.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, I'm a sorcerer! I do all kinds of fun things with the arcane!","response":"DM: “We shall talk.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Very good, I'm always willing to learn. Seems you are very powerful.","response":"DM: “My name… Clarota.”"}
{"prompt":"ALL: Clarota.\nMARISHA: Can we call you Clarence for short?","response":"DM: “No!”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay! Clar-ota\nALL: Clarota.\nLIAM: Sounds Spanish.\nLAURA: Please, join us on the carpet.\nSAM: Can he fit on the carpet?\nLIAM: He is very thin.\nLAURA: She can fly.\nMARISHA: I'll fly.\nORION: The rest of our allies are up.","response":"DM: He carefully steps on the carpet, once again like its tentacles are (slithering noises)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I keep a distance.","response":"DM: Moving around, its mouth and its eyes are constantly darting, it looks extremely nervous and almost like a cornered animal that's just barely being coaxed onto this journey. You see with each step it takes there a slight flicker of arcane energy at the tip of its fingers, like it's just prepared for anything to go terribly wrong. It steps onto the carpet and goes, “Take me to your allies.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ah yes, we have wonderful allies!\nMARISHA: You can even maybe call them friends, even?\nLAURA: Not just yet!","response":"DM: It crosses its legs and sits on the carpet, holding its staff to its chest on the far corner staring at all of you and says, “Go. Now.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hold on tight.","response":"DM: You guys make your way up to the top, eventually you see the carpet (whoosh) over the edge of the crevasse, come down to a rest, as your party has now brought with you the stuff of nightmares."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That is the thing I saw in the village!\nLAURA: Hold on! Hold on!\nTRAVIS: What is that? Oh my god!","response":"DM: At which point, it's leapt off at this point, hovering about and you can see this crackle of fire in its hand and it goes, (panicked noises)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No! No!\nORION: I'm standing between them, like, it's okay! These are the allies we speak of!\nLAURA: Peace, friends! We are ourselves!\nORION: Grog, don't do anything!\nLAURA: We are not controlled.\nORION: Don't use a whip, Scanlan, sing a friendly song as he is our friend– ally. To the guy. Ally. He is– He's in a little spot of trouble and we are going to help him get revenge, or something of the sort.\nSAM: He's a friend? Help–\nORION: He prefers–","response":"DM: “Ally.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ally.\nSAM: Ally.\nMARISHA: Ally.\nSAM: Ally.\nTALIESIN: Ally?\nTRAVIS: What's on your head?","response":"DM: He kind of gives you this keen look of, huh, the least person I expected to ask a question."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Let's destroy your hive.","response":"DM: “No.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No?","response":"DM: “You see, the hive is sick. The mind that keeps us safe is no longer its own.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh?","response":"DM: “One, an alien one, has come and taken the mind hostage, it has taken my people as its own playthings. I was able to escape its mental grasp.” It reaches up and taps the metal on its head."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Tinfoil hat!\nMARISHA and TALIESIN: Magneto helmet!\nMARISHA: This is the guy we've needed this whole time!","response":"DM: “My people will not so easily escape its grasp, they are now under the control of this creature.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So if we did it–\nSAM: If we find this creature, we might be able to free your hive as well.","response":"DM: “That would be why I wish to have your alliance.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: “Help me free our hivemind, free my people.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (whispers) Sense motive.\nLAURA: Oh yeah, can we sense motive on him?\nLAURA: Oh gosh.\nTRAVIS: I would do it, but–\nMARISHA: We should also have him help us in your–","response":"DM: I would put this in a group sense motive right now."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I rolled 14.\nLAURA: I rolled– what do we add to it?","response":"DM: Sense motive in this would be your insight, sorry. Pathfinder to Fifth Edition!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Insight? 24.\nMARISHA: 18?\nTRAVIS: 16.\nORION: 14.\nTALIESIN: Natural one.\nLIAM: Four.\nTRAVIS: 16!\nSAM: 13.\nTRAVIS: (happy scream) 16!","response":"DM: Okay!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You're a people person!","response":"DM: Through your intense grasping this creature's disposition, best you can, as alien and unfamiliar as its mannerisms and speech and interests may be, you get the feeling that it's speaking out of desperation and it's speaking out of genuine interest. You've piqued it with the hint of revenge, you've piqued it with the idea of alliance as opposed to being alone. You get the feeling that it speaks the truth. It genuinely is asking for your help in freeing its people from whatever is influencing their current actions."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What's his name?\nLAURA: Cla-ro-ta?","response":"DM: Clarota."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can we just call him Clarence?\nLIAM: (Jimmy Stewart voice) Clarence, Clarence!\nTALIESIN: Clara. It could be a she.\nLAURA: We are very interested in being allies with you. Might we have your word that upon defeating this creature, we will be safe?\nSAM: And as a symbol of our dedication to you, I'd love to play you just a little bit of a song that might heal some of those wounds and scrapes that you seem to have all over your body.","response":"DM: He gives you the dirtiest look you've ever received."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (whispers) It was because of the arcane!\nSAM: It's a pretty good song!","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on, Burt Reynolds!\nSAM: Hm. Ooh! 17.","response":"DM: He takes a sudden step forward towards you, his tentacles– (slithering noises)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ew, ugh!","response":"DM: “Play this song.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Break out the–\nLAURA: It better be good!\nSAM: (sings) When I get that feeling, I want Clarota healing. Clarota healing is something that's good for you. Ooh ooh ooh. (sings embellished melisma)\nLAURA: Clarota's dancing, I can see it!","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check– no, a performance check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A performance check!\n18!","response":"DM: 18."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh!\nSAM: There's many more where that came from!","response":"DM: “Now we talk about how we can kill K'varn.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: K'varn!\nLAURA and SAM: Yes!\nMARISHA: Yes! Let's talk about that.\nSAM: End scene!","response":"DM: And that's where we're going to go ahead and end it for today, guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Sorry we had to rebel, you guys.\nLAURA: Yeah sorry about that, you guys. Sorry!\nMARISHA: Sorry! It was for a good cause!\nLIAM: Thank you for rebelling, and staking out on your own!","response":"DM: You've acquired for the moment a very curious ally. Yeah, this will be an interesting branching point for next week."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my gosh.\nTRAVIS: We should get some damn hats.\nLAURA: I know! We should get him to make us hats!\nMARISHA: We definitely need one for Grog. We have to get him to make us hats for Grog.\nTRAVIS: Why me?\nLIAM: Trolls.","response":"DM: And a couple trolls and an ogre, by sending them off a cliff! It was a pretty eventful evening!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: So yeah, so guys, thank you so much forwatching! Also, as a reminder, there is Dwarven Forge that's been doing an amazing kickstarter for its next set. I was a supporter for all of Dwarven Forge's kickstarters and I'm looking forward to being able to break out some of those dungeon tiles in this game in the near future. But if you haven't checked it out yet, I recommend it! Go and see if you can back it. Those guys are awesome, the quality of their work is great! All of you DMs out there that wanna run some seriously legit dungeon setups for your miniatures and battle circumstances, it's highly recommended. So go check that out. I know I've already backed it, so come join me! And (evil voice) one of us, one of us! Anyway, does anyone else have something they wanna talk about for the evening, guys?"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: I do.","response":"DM: Zac! What's up, buddy?"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Thanks for tuning in, guys. I wanted to bring up International Tabletop Day.","response":"DM: Yes! Yes! Let's do that!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just google it.\nZAC: Google it!","response":"DM: Angelfire.tabletopday.com"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: So I think that's pretty much it, thanks so much guys.","response":"DM: Yeah, no worries, I think next week we're gonna try and do a Q&A after the game. So we'll stay for an hour or more after."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Subs only!","response":"DM: Subs only! You get to hang out."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Subs only, so if you want to ask questions next week after the show, make sure you subscribe.","response":"DM: Yes! Do it!"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Do it. Yeah, that's pretty much it, man.","response":"DM: Hell yeah, awesome! Well, thanks again, guys, for tuning in to Critical Role. Spread the love, tell your friends about it, all come back and join in the story, and we'll have more fun next week, so. See you next Thursday."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Tune in tomorrow for So You Don't Have To, where Becca and Hector play the worst games they can find so you don't have to. And then Gather your Party, where we play board games with our friends, and it's gonna be a lot of fun.","response":"DM: Hell yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: So, without further ado, let's go and kick into the recap. So, the party has initially been sent down on a mission by the arcanist Allura Vysoren in search of a halfling paladin who has gone missing, named Lady Kima of Vord. A folk hero and a very respected individual, she went on a vision quest and apparently went alone into Kraghammer seeking some sort of great evil that was festering beneath the city, and hasn't been seen for weeks and weeks. The party was hired by her to go and try to find her whereabouts and hopefully bring her back safely. Since traversing and meeting individuals in Kraghammer, they then spearheaded into the Greyspine Mines where apparently these monstrosities have been burbling out time and time again over the past few weeks. Pushing down, they had encountered umber hulks, they managed to inquire some duergar, which, apparently there's a lot of them down here. Duergar being an ashy-skinned, subterranean dark, evil dwarf-type offshoot. One of which had with it a brain-type quadruped that managed to Brain Spike Grog and send him catatonic for a short time. They, wandering through the caverns, discovered there was a duergar war camp across the way from– across this large chasm that was currently being run by a general duergar alongside what appeared to be, and what they've now discovered to be, a mind flayer or an illithid. They managed to, upon looking deeper into this cavern, finding hidden behind a waterfall, thanks to the druid and the ranger, completely stealing from the rest of the group their flying carpet, made a very tenuous relationship and alignment with another mind flayer, apparently cast out of his own society, searching to find a way to both get revenge and find his way back into his colony of people. And his name was Clarota, lovingly called Clarence by the group, probably much to his own chagrin. After which they decided to go ahead and try to extract information from this duergar general, and stop this war camp from preparing itself for battle and attack, seemingly, on Kraghammer in the near future. Through a strange, crazy plan they came up with, they managed to fly undetected over via flying carpet and eagle, and floating sorcerer, over the entire war camp, made a Metal Gear run into the center of their main barracks–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Whoops.\nORION: I'm waving through it.","response":"DM: Tiberius is waving through it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, you're still up top.","response":"DM: The general's on the ground, warhammer at his side, blackened armor still kind of sizzling with the arcane energy from his temporary Banishment via Scanlan. He sits there with this kind of gnarled, brackish beard, looking about the rest of you with these wild kind of white-coated eyes. “So you found your way in. What's your purpose? What do you want from me?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, Vax walks right up to him and walks behind him and grabs him by the hair, and right back to this position. Let's have a talk.\nLAURA: Oh.\nLIAM: Would you care to have a chat?\nLAURA: Of course I would, thank you.","response":"DM: “If you want blood, take it. It's all you're getting from me.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay, kill him.\nALL: No, wait!\nORION: Hold on a second, ask the question.\nLAURA: We don't want your blood.\nORION: What are we asking?\nLAURA: We're looking for a halfling. Have you seen one?","response":"DM: “I don't know what you're talking about.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: A female halfling. She came down here.","response":"DM: “Well, she wouldn't have gotten far if she did. Not with my people.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I take my dagger and stick it in about a centimeter and say, your master is gone, it's just you and your friends here now, I think it's in your best interest to talk. You could walk away from here. You don't have to die if you can play nicely.\nORION: And believe me when I tell you he usually kills everybody. He doesn't give that offer very often.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an intimidation roll with advantage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: First roll of the night. First roll of the night.\nORION: Yeah!\nLIAM: Natural 20!","response":"DM: That's a way to start."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The first one tonight!\nLAURA: That's the way!\nTRAVIS: Probably those eight miles you rode.\nORION: Shush!","response":"DM: As you pull the blade to his throat, he chuckles deeply against the strain. “Your halfling lass was foolish. We took her. We delivered her to King Murghol as a present. If she lives, she's probably ruined and broken deep within the dungeons of Emberhold. You're welcome to go for her there.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Who's this king of yours?\nLAURA: King what?\nMARISHA: Murgholt?","response":"DM: “Murghol.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Which way should we head?","response":"DM: “Ooh, down, probably.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I mean, is there any particular shortcuts or less running into your kind along the way, I suppose?","response":"DM: “I highly doubt it.” He spits in your direction."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! Prestidigitation. And I catch it and throw it back into his face.\nMARISHA: Can I do an insight check to see if he's lying about that?","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I think we have some prisoners to free or something as well.\nLAURA: Yes.\nMARISHA: 22.","response":"DM: He does not appear to be lying about his interpretation of her, apparently she is where he is. As to where her current state is, you don't know, but he seems to have a very, very made-up mind as to her possibility of her being alive still."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What about a secret path that we can maybe get through to avoid some of these people? Was kind of wondering if he's lying.","response":"DM: You can press him that information even harder."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hey guys, we should press him for information about this passage.\nLIAM: Just a couple of more questions.\nLAURA: Can I start speaking to him in Underdark?","response":"DM: Of course."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And I ask him–\nMARISHA: That's hot.\nLAURA: Yep, it's an awesome language. Tell me about the hidden passages. I know there are some. I am good tonight, you guys\nTRAVIS: What does Underdark sound like, by the way?\nLAURA: It sounds kind of like–\nTALIESIN: Parseltongue?\nLIAM: It's like Pig Latin.\nLAURA: (speaking Undercommon)\nTRAVIS: Mm, no!\nLIAM: Ere-way are the idden-hay assages-pay?","response":"DM: It's kind of reminiscent of Black Speech from the Tolkien universe, that has that guttural (speaking Black Speech) very, very deep."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh right, that.\nALL: (speaking Black Speech)","response":"DM: A little bit like a whispering darkness to it. As she speaks this tongue, it catches a lot of you off guard, you've not heard her use this tongue until this point. Make an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (gasps) Vex, what are you doing? What is this coming out of your mouth?\nTRAVIS: That sounds real pretty.\nLAURA: Right, I have my papers.","response":"DM: Get your sheet ready."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh noes, hold on, hold on.","response":"DM: You got your paper today? Lovely."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She's bonafide.\nLAURA: 18.\nASHLEY: Is it through the lake?","response":"DM: “Yes, through the lake. Deep below, you'll find a tunnel. This tunnel will lead you to a subterranean passage straight to the stronghold.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we check to make sure he's not untruthful?","response":"DM: Make an insight."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (groans) Okay. 16?","response":"DM: No, he's bullshitting through his teeth."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, okay.\nLIAM: Vex'ahlia?","response":"DM: Hey, he seemed honest about the passage but dishonest about the– he's basically following her lead. “Uh-huh.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You're lying.","response":"DM: “Perhaps.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Tell us true, where is it?","response":"DM: “If I tell you, will you let me live?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Ooh. Well.\nTALIESIN: I think that's very reasonable.\nLAURA: I think that's reasonable. We'll–","response":"DM: “I'm essentially–”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We will not kill you.\nLAURA: I think we can–\nTRAVIS: We can lock him up. And then kill him.\nLIAM: We'll leave you alive.\nLAURA: We'll leave you alive.\nLIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: “Don't just leave me alive. Give me a chance to walk from this building, on my own, arms intact.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No.","response":"DM: “And I'll give you the secret entrance to Emberhold itself, leading you straight within the throne room.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, that's a good thing.\nTALIESIN: So we have to leave you alive, and let you leave this building intact?","response":"DM: “Correct.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I go over and pick up his warhammer and say, you may– maybe– leave. But I get to keep this as a souvenir.\nTALIESIN: I actually think this is an appropriate moment to play with a bit of banditry. I say we take everything from him and he can make his way out all on his own.\nTRAVIS: I like that idea.\nLAURA: Yeah–\nMARISHA: Ooh, that's fun.\nLAURA: – all his clothes, everything.\nTRAVIS: Butt naked.\nLIAM: And you can advise–\nMARISHA: Wait, wait, hang on.\nORION: As is his undergarments on for–\nTRAVIS: Why?\nORION: I don't care to see that.\nMARISHA: Why don't we take him with us? Just in casies–\nMARISHA: Ew.","response":"DM: – a partially hooded Clarota steps forward and says, “I'll attempt to read his surface thoughts. If he tries to keep it from me, I'll know.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Smart, smart!","response":"DM: As he steps forward, he puts one hand in front of him and his eyes gleam with a sickly green hue. You can see the general tips his head back for a second and begins twitching an eye. Sweat begins to bead around his brow as Clarota takes another step forward, tensing his hand once more, his head beginning to bow forward with an intensity, a force of focus towards his direction. You can now see the general, “Let me live. Let me go and I'll tell you. This isn't necessary. I'm willing to give you the information.” You can see a trickle of blood begin to pour out of one of his nostrils."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.\nORION: That's a mind flayer.\nLAURA: What do we do? I think we should stop him. Should we stop him?\nLIAM: Clarota.\nLAURA: Wait.\nLIAM: Does he know anything about K'varn?\nLIAM: I walk up–\nLAURA: I think we should just ask him.\nLIAM: – next to Clarota, push the dwarf against the wall, and say, our friend here is not as patient as I am. We want to know about this K'varn, and we want you and all your men, all your little mates here, to throw your weapons into the chasm, you can go fuck off, but we want to know everything. And this is your last chance. Right now, right here. Talk.\nTRAVIS: And you have to get naked.\nLAURA: (whispers) And you have to get naked.\nLIAM: That's correct.\nORION: Will you stop with the naked? Grog–\nTRAVIS: What?\nTALIESIN: I'm with you on that.\nTRAVIS: Thank you.\nASHLEY: Yeah, me too.\nMARISHA: It's starting to become a thing now. I'm just saying.","response":"DM: “K'varn was responsible for forging the alliance. For centuries and generations, his people and mine killed and fought. It wasn't until K'varn came that we decided to work together for a common cause. Expansion, unification, dominion over this land and these mountains. Divided, we were weak, petty, greedy. With K'varn leading us, we have purpose, we have growth. We could take what we'd like, and I'm but one dwarf. If I fall over here, many more will take over where I fell.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well, we can see that's obviously worked out really well for you. I think that I'm satisfied, are you satisfied?\nLAURA: What kind of creature is K'varn?\nLIAM: What is K'varn?","response":"DM: “I have not seen K'varn personally.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But you've heard rumors, though?\nLAURA: Is he telling the truth?","response":"DM: Insight check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Insight check for me as well.\nTALIESIN: Would I recognize this creature he's describing?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a nature check. Or arcana, either one."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I assist him?\nTALIESIN: Or arcana? 14.\nMARISHA: Can I do a nature check?","response":"DM: This'll be more for your own personal knowledge, probably not. But you can make one yourself."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well, that's what I'm saying.\nTALIESIN: 14.\nMARISHA: 'Cause you're doing arcana?\nTALIESIN: I did arcana.\nORION: A d20 roll.\nMARISHA: I'm doing nature. 29, nature.\nLIAM: It's clearly a narwhal.","response":"DM: It is."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's a sentient narwhal.","response":"DM: It's an awful, awful narwhal. Way to spoil the story, Liam."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Demon narwhal.\nASHLEY: (singsong) Well, maybe we should go.","response":"DM: Gnashing teeth, black horn, very intelligent. That doesn't seem to be anything from nature itself. From your experience, there are different entities, but usually there are multiple horns. Singular, demonic beings that would have extreme intelligence, sharp teeth, horns, and you've had brief brushes in the past with demonic entities that seems to run in a similar vein, but nothing in particular is creeping into mind. It's going to be difficult for you to specifically come up with this, with what little information you currently have. Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, I'm satisfied.\nLIAM: I am, too.\nLAURA: Maybe we should let him go.\nLIAM: Why don't you strip?\nORION: I agree.\nTRAVIS: Do you wanna handcuff him?\nASHLEY: Take off your clothes!\nLAURA: Yeah, let's take his– We take Grog's handcuffs out of his bag.","response":"DM: “Let me– That was not the deal! You leave me, unspoiled, on my life, and I tell you the way into Emberhold.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, tell us!\nORION: Take the hammer. That's rough on him. Leave his armor on.\nLAURA: You haven't told us yet, have you?\nLIAM: We already told you your weapons are ours.\nTALIESIN: In fact, we'll be keeping your weapons, your armor, and I believe, your pride.\nMARISHA: Yes.\nLAURA: But your life is yours.\nTALIESIN: You may even outrun the dwarves we're about to set free.\nORION and TRAVIS: Oh good, yeah.\nTRAVIS: Nice! Percy's fucked-up tonight, I like it.\nTALIESIN: I'm in a mood.","response":"DM: “Emberhold.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He tried to make a book out of someone's flesh once.\nLAURA: Wait, wait. He's telling us, shut up.\nLIAM: Yes, sorry.","response":"DM: “Emberhold is the fortress of our people, built to resist assault from all sides.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Shite.\nLIAM: Insight check. Is he full of shit? I rolled– Oh, nothing too hot at all. Never mind, forget it. Forget I said anything.\nLIAM: Stepping behind, I take my knife, and I cut his belt loose and let his pants fall, and I give him a little nudge.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You're free to go. Not toward your stronghold, but towards the surface.","response":"DM: So his belt falls, changepurse, and everything. He is wearing full plate black armor–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sure.","response":"DM: So his trousers do not plummet."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Aw, that's a shame.\nTRAVIS: Can't we have Scanlan turn him into a porpoise?","response":"DM: He picks up his warhammer."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I don't think so. No, that's mine. As a token to remember you by.","response":"DM: “Unspoiled was the deal.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wasn't the deal.\nTRAVIS: No, it's great. You can really argue all you want to, or I'll just smash your fucking head in.\nLIAM: Wasn't the deal!\nTALIESIN: Alive was the deal.\nLIAM: We said you were alive, your weapons were ours. What, have you got shit in your ears?\nORION: I thought you meant you wouldn't get dirty, like you know, not spoiled. Which I was totally fine with.","response":"DM: Takes a couple of steps forward towards you, holding the warhammer out."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Your skull is unspoiled.","response":"DM: Suddenly, he turns completely invisible, vanishes from sight."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: My perception's really high, can I try to find him?\nLIAM: Yeah, we can. Perception check.\nTRAVIS: You dicks.","response":"DM: You hear (footsteps running)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Perception check.\nLAURA: Wait, no!\nORION: He's gone.\nLAURA: Mother bitch.\nMARISHA: It's fine.\nLIAM: 18 for me.\nMARISHA: Just let him go, it's all he's got.\nASHLEY: We should throw something.\nTRAVIS: (high-pitched) I want the hammer!\nMARISHA: It's all he's got right now. He's naked, and now he's invisible running through a cavern.\nLAURA: He's not naked!","response":"DM: At this point–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm gonna attack him.","response":"DM: Before you have the opportunity–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah?","response":"DM: – he becomes visible again, about 20 feet out, gone down the stairs and towards the front door and he just–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm throwing a dagger at him.\nMARISHA: Oh look.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: And I'm throwing my ax at him with the chain of returning as well.\nLIAM: Oh good, that's great. 28 for me.\nORION: Oh shit.\nLIAM: Yeah, sure it does. Dick!","response":"DM: It's not a Sneak Attack, just damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, that's fine.","response":"DM: You chuck your ax at him."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17.\nMARISHA: And I just yell, sorry!","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17.\nLIAM: Ten for me.\nLIAM: Ten.","response":"DM: He is there, standing in place with his arms locked like this."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, Clarota.\nTRAVIS: 15.","response":"DM: 15 damage?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Should've left the hammer.\nLIAM: Ten.\nLIAM: (sings) Do do do do doo, I'm lovin' it.","response":"DM: A few moments of this horrible slurping sound–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.","response":"DM: – and you hear this dull, sickening, hollow (suction) sound. The tentacles release, Clarota releases his grip from his head, and the captain falls onto his back, a giant bloodied hole in the center of his skull."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: He ate his brain?\nTRAVIS: I guess you should've left the hammer, shouldn't you?\nTALIESIN: Some people are terrible losers, just really terrible.\nORION: I'm going to loot the body.\nLAURA: Yeah, well. Yeah, we definitely do that.\nTRAVIS: I would like to pick up the hammer.\nMARISHA: This is a good lesson, to no one else that's watching.\nORION: Clarota, that was incredible. Well done!\nLAURA: Clarota–\nASHLEY: Clarota, I am a fan.\nMARISHA: No one is watching this valuable lesson.\nTALIESIN: Do not be an oathbreaker.\nMARISHA: To not be an oathbreaker.\nTALIESIN: Know when you've lost your clothes.\nLAURA: Was that actually, like, a meal for you?","response":"DM: As you're looking, you can see there's that kind of weird purplish crimson around his tendrils, as he kinda wipes it off with his hands, and goes, “It's enough to sustain me a while. I was getting hungry.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well. Better him than us, I say.\nTRAVIS: Right. Me, I'm just an appetizer.\nORION: Yes, indeed.\nLAURA: Loot the body!","response":"DM: Yes, so you loot the body. You find amongst all the duergar bodies here, as you're quickly jumping around and grabbing, it's hard to count the exact amount, but you're looking at somewhere in the neighbourhood of about five to six hundred gold pieces. You'll have to check later."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh!\nLIAM: Mm-hm.\nLAURA: I write that down.\nORION: He was a general.","response":"DM: A series of black iron weapons. None of them seem to, at a quick glance, have any sort of magical value. The blackened plate armor on the duergar itself does radiate a magical essence, as does the warhammer he was holding."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it just him wearing the black plate armor–","response":"DM: Yeah."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: We should take that and put it in the bag of holding, so we can sneak in if we want to.\nTRAVIS: Okay.\nLIAM: Tiberius, can you tell us anything about these things?\nLAURA: How many sets were there?","response":"DM: From what is in here, that would be 11 sets, total."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, that hammer is amazing, obviously, because we saw it in action. I'd say Grog should have it.\nLAURA: 11 sets of armor!","response":"DM: Because there were also sets that were on the rack at the very front."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice!\nASHLEY: Hey.\nMARISHA: Is Grog about to get a new weapon?\nTRAVIS: 11 sets of armor, okay.\nORION: And I'll do an arcana check, right? An arcana check on the stuff?","response":"DM: An arcana check, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Laura, you got a grapple arrow, last I gave you, by the way.\nLAURA: I did?\nORION: 23.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, I got it– you now have a trap arrow.\nLAURA: A grappler arrow?\nTALIESIN: Yeah, you fire it and it prones somebody.\nLAURA: Seriously? That's so cool, thank you!","response":"DM: There you go, sir."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm gonna Hawkeye you out at some point.\nLAURA: Oh my gosh.\nTALIESIN: I know.\nTRAVIS: Can you do a magical check on the– Oh, he's got it.\nORION: I did.","response":"DM: So, as Tiberius is looking over the equipment, kind of poring through his arcane knowledge."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, oh, ooh! I think Pike and Grog would benefit from these, most definitely. Here.\nLAURA: What is it? What was it?\nLIAM: There's not any kind of dark magic about the armor, is there?\nORION: I mean, it's dark in color.\nLIAM: Yes, that's fine.\nORION: But it's, you know, your standard arcana magic.\nASHLEY: Clarota, so when you eat their brains, do you also get their thoughts, maybe?\nTRAVIS: Ooh! The heavy plate armor has resistance to fire damage.\nASHLEY: Or it's just– it's gone after that.\nTRAVIS: The warhammer–\nLIAM: Sh!","response":"DM: “There are residual memories, thoughts. It's delicious.” And you can see, there's this almost rapturous look in his face you haven't seen before. For a moment, Clarota looks a little younger, a little stronger, a little more dangerous. And you're put off a little bit by it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Clarota is Dracula.","response":"DM: But there's kind of this momentary kind of relishing in the moment and–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do we need to give you a moment alone? We can leave.","response":"DM: “He speaks the truth about the path into the Emberhold.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So, he spoke of some sort of trap door that's easy to open from within, but not from outside, correct?\nMARISHA: It was hidden by a lava flow.\nLAURA: Yes, two lava flows–","response":"DM: The smaller of the two."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: – the smaller of the two.\nLIAM: The smaller of the two.","response":"DM: On the left side."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: On the left side of the keep.\nLAURA: Yes. Can I ask a question?","response":"DM: Yes?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm raising my hand.\nLAURA: Are there a lot of other soldiers still in the camp, or did we–","response":"DM: Oh, there are plenty of soldiers still in the camp."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, we–\nLAURA: Ooh.","response":"DM: You stealthed into the barracks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh shit! We should've kept him alive, you guys! Okay, okay, okay. Yes, Grog?\nLIAM: Well, he was about to walk out the door and cause mayhem.\nORION: That's true.\nMARISHA: That's true. He was gonna alert everybody.\nTRAVIS: Can I harvest any natural armor from the bulette? The kitty?\nLAURA: Ooh!","response":"DM: You can certainly try. There's plates that have been broken and cracked. You can try and start cleaving away at it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and TRAVIS: Shit.\nORION: What do I see? I'm still on the roof.\nLAURA: Okay, we should all– Can we all–","response":"DM: You don't see anything yet. You just hear bells starting to go off in the city."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, we should all put on black armor. Does that matter?\nLIAM: We should just get out of here. Keyleth, can you fucking eagle up and let's go.","response":"DM: You start hearing horns."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We need to free those dwarves.\nMARISHA: Eagle up?","response":"DM: Big horns. You start seeing torches being lit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Stealth, stealth. And get out. Go stealth and get out.\nLIAM: We need to get out, now.\nORION: Oh guys, the jig is up!\nLAURA: I shoot my grapple thing and go up out of the ceiling.\nLIAM: Tiberius.\nORION: What?\nLIAM: Cast Fly on this fucker right here, we need to get out of here. We just need to get out the way we came in.\nMARISHA: I cast Pass Without A Trace. Everyone stand near me. And I'll turn into an eagle and I scoop up the gnomes.","response":"DM: Okay, what's the radius on Pass Without A Trace?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Like a thousand yards.\nMARISHA: Like a hundred yards.","response":"DM: Four miles, it's all I got."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But I take the dust of tracelessness out of the bag of holding and I sprinkle it around the room.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we grapple up out from the ceiling?","response":"DM: Well, the arrow that you have that he made, it's essentially an arrow that bursts into a tanglefoot bag. When it bursts, it grapples whoever's there, it's not like grappling an arrow."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, it's not like a string arrow, although I'll build that.\nLAURA: Oh, I thought it was like a grappling–\nTALIESIN: It's a trip arrow.\nLAURA: Oh, that's cool, okay.\nMARISHA: A 30-foot radius.\nTALIESIN: I'll make you a grappling– I didn't follow that though. I'll make you a grappling arrow.\nLAURA: I have a grappling hook. Yeah, we should grapple out.","response":"DM: 30-foot radius, okay, so you could just–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just, hug me.","response":"DM: – barely get Tiberius in there if you–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Stay close.\nTRAVIS: You can go on my back.","response":"DM: On the platform, so yeah."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, I'm gonna jump on Grog's back.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, and I pick up Scanlan under my arm.\nLAURA: We have a regular grappling hook, we'll just get up out of the–\nTALIESIN: We have a flying carpet.\nASHLEY: And hold onto some straps.\nORION: And we're all on the carpet?\nLIAM: The carpet's away, but this guy is flying?\nORION: Yes.\nLIAM: Flying Grog.\nTRAVIS: I am? I thought we were all– Okay.\nLIAM: No, you can't go on the carpet. You're too heavy.\nLAURA: What are we doing?\nLIAM: We're going up. Straight up.\nLAURA: Up and out. Can we stealth, while we do it?","response":"DM: So, you guys, right now, as you're carrying the two gnomes, all of you except for Grog are on the carpet, correct?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yep, I'm flying.\nLAURA: Where's Trinket?\nTALIESIN: Trinket's back on the other side.","response":"DM: Trinket's back on the other side. Trinket didn't come with you to the battle, because there was nobody to get Trinket across."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, he's just on the other side by himself, all lonely?","response":"DM: Yeah, I know."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He's in goblin town.","response":"DM: Eh, you weren't here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's so terrible.\nASHLEY: He's safe over there?","response":"DM: Hopefully."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh Trinket!\nTRAVIS: He's been raging.","response":"DM: Everyone, make a stealth check. With a plus ten additional modifier thanks to Keyleth's spell."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, awesome. That helped.\nORION: 20.\nASHLEY: Oh, 20!\nMARISHA: 18.\nTRAVIS: Natural? Oh.\nLAURA: Nice. Ooh, natural 20!\nTALIESIN: 19.\nTRAVIS: 19.\nASHLEY: 20.\nLAURA and TRAVIS: Natural 20.\nLAURA: 31 for me.\nLIAM: 29.\nLAURA: Oh, they saw us.\nASHLEY: Maybe you should scream, like, no, they went the other way!\nLIAM: Just keep going up, up, up.\nLAURA: How did they see us? I thought we were stealthed.\nORION: I see where it's coming and I shoot a Fireball.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's good, that's good.\nMARISHA: Wait, what are you doing?","response":"DM: Okay, so there's a volley of javelins and a Fireball streaking past. You'll be able to get ten of them in that Fireball blast, go ahead and roll for damage on that. However, for those that rolled less than 20 on stealth, each of you are getting three javelins each to you. So that's you two, and Grog. What'd you roll again?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Less than 20.\nORION: 22.","response":"DM: Okay, yeah. So you three. So three javelins against you, miss you entirely. Percy. Actually, one more against you, Keyleth. That one does hit. You take 14 points of piercing damage as the javelin just gleans off the side of your giant eagle torso."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (eagle noises)","response":"DM: Percy, that's a 21, an 18, and a 20. So you take three javelins. 24 points of piercing damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 24 points?","response":"DM: Yeah, 24 points total, as three javelins– Two strike you off the shoulders and one actually embeds itself partway into your waist and you have to pull it out, and probably dug a good six, seven inches in."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What are you at?\nTALIESIN: I'm at 15.\nASHLEY: 15?\nORION: By the way, 41 points of fire damage.\nTALIESIN: I was already really low.\nTRAVIS: Take me instead.\nLAURA: We haven't healed him yet.\nASHLEY: Wait, we healed the other game. Even with that?\nTALIESIN: Oh, did I fully heal?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, come on.","response":"DM: That– Natural 20. A 17, what's your AC?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: No, it was like 24.\nTRAVIS: 18.\nASHLEY: 24 points.","response":"DM: That one misses, and the last one– Yeah, two natural 20s."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.\nASHLEY: That was 24.","response":"DM: Not even joking."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Double crits, oh.\nLAURA: Two crits against you?\nLIAM: Good thing you got a thousand hit points.\nTRAVIS: (high-pitched) Oh no.\nLIAM: That's the point of a meat tank.","response":"DM: You take a total of 36 points of piercing damage, Grog."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: And he still has more hitpoints than we do.","response":"DM: Yeah, probably."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ouchies.","response":"DM: Oh, barbarian."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: If Scanlan were here, he'd moon and blind all.\nLAURA: He is here, technically.","response":"DM: He is here, Scanlan's holding on tight as–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He's here, he's watching.\nTALIESIN: Scanlan's peeing, peeing down.","response":"DM: However, as the javelins strike all you guys, moments later there's a gargantuan explosion, and there's a flash of reddish light from below. A giant fiery blooming explosion bursts into the center of that area. You can see duergar thrown left and right. You manage to take out about 12 of them in that one blast."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes!\nLAURA: Nice!\nLIAM: Yeah, home slice.","response":"DM: You guys continue, cresting over the top. You can now see more and more are starting to gather, the bells are going off, the horns are blowing hard. You can see a bunch of them are now running over to what looks like some of this siege equipment they had constructed–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA and LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: Which includes a few large ballistae."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I think we should friggin' dive bomb towards the far tunnel past this war camp.\nLAURA: No, but Trinket!\nLIAM: Is fine, he's hiding out. They don't know he's here.\nTRAVIS: Leave him.\nTALIESIN: He'll be fine.\nORION: I'm not concerned with the bear right now!\nLIAM: We're going to dive. Yes, dive bomb, dive bomb!\nTALIESIN: The bear can take care of himself.\nLIAM: I take hold of the front of the carpet and steer it up and over, along the roof and then down towards the tunnel. I'm steering the carpet.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys are coming down. You basically shot up, curved around–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We shouldn't go down.","response":"DM: And you're going backwards towards the barracks. As you do, another volley of–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We got to free those dwarves, y'all.","response":"DM: Another volley comes to the guys who were under-stealthed."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We don't have to. That seems complicated.\nORION: Who's not stealthed?","response":"DM: However, there is one attack less each because of the duergar that you had taken out. So, against Keyleth, one hits. You take 12 points of piercing damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I am no longer an eagle.\nTALIESIN: Oh my God.\nTRAVIS: Oh shit, really?\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Are you paying attention?\nORION: Wait, what?\nTRAVIS: She's not an eagle anymore.\nLAURA: Keyleth isn't a–\nMARISHA: I hit zero hit points as an eagle.\nASHLEY: Wait, what are you again?\nLAURA: What happened?\nLIAM: She's not an eagle and she's falling with the gnomes.","response":"DM: Keyleth's form shifts back into that of Keyleth. You guys are about 80 feet up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Help!\nLAURA: Okay, okay!\nASHLEY: Can I–","response":"DM: At which point, both Scanlan and Pike go into a free fall along with Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wait, can I–\nLAURA: No, no, she was on Grog, she was–\nORION: Are we under them? Are we under them?\nLIAM: I don't know, are we?\nASHLEY: No, I was on her.","response":"DM: No, you guys are about parallel. You guys were moving together."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Parallel?\nORION: Go under them!\nLAURA: Yeah, we dive under them.\nLIAM: Dive, dive, dive, dive!\nORION: I cast Glacial Blast and I create a bridge that scoops them up, right under them. As we dive right under them.\nLIAM: Party trick.","response":"DM: Okay, you guys are out in the middle of the open cavern. There's no place to connect the bridge, so you're essentially creating a giant ice–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM and LAURA: Chunk.","response":"DM: Chunk right beneath them. Which is also now in freefall."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Huh? No!","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Even wizards make mistakes.\nORION: Damn it!","response":"DM: So as you guys try and swoop underneath as they're plummeting– You're riding this, go ahead and make an acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.\nORION: No, I didn't think of that.\nMARISHA: I don't know what to do.\nLAURA: Can we try to catch– can we try to– what do I have?\nASHLEY: Wait, can I–\nTRAVIS: Are we over the war camp, or are we over the–\nLIAM: 25.\nLAURA: Over the war camp.\nMARISHA: Oh, come on, Tiberius.\nTALIESIN: Oh boy.\nMARISHA: Oh, save my life, again, Tiberius.\nORION: Oh no.\nLAURA: Can I try to–\nMARISHA: Oh shit.\nLIAM: I let go of the front of the carpet, I stick a–\nASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait, wait, can I cast War God's Blessing to give him a plus ten?","response":"DM: Unfortunately, you're falling."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Fuck.","response":"DM: You're like (worried noise), you're just plummeting through the air like a rock because you're in full plate armor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I use the rope of endless twine and try to lasso one of them? 'Cause I'm really a good shot.\nASHLEY: How far are we falling?","response":"DM: You have to pull it out of the bag of holding and then turn into a lasso, that's gonna take you a full minute, so you don't have time."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I have a rope. I let go of the front of the carpet, I put one end of the rope in my sister's hand, and I jump off towards Pike, holding it around in one hand as I go–\nLAURA: Oh god.\nTALIESIN: I grapple onto her to hold her down.\nASHLEY: No! No, no, no, I have so much armor.\nLAURA: Okay, then you should–\nLAURA: Oh okay, except you're dangling off of it now by a rope.","response":"DM: You lost your concentration, so Glacial Blast didn't go off, thankfully. That would've been really bad."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, wait, we slam into the top of what?\nTALIESIN: Us.","response":"DM: You guys slam onto the top of the rest of the group, in there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's too many people on the carpet.","response":"DM: Because you lost your concentration, your flight spell also dissipates. Grog is now plummeting."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!\nTRAVIS: Yay!\nALL: (worried noises)\nLAURA: We're gonna die!","response":"DM: The carpet now has too much weight and is currently giving out."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: #savecriticalrole.\nORION: Get me close to him. I cast Featherfall on you.","response":"DM: It's slowing your fall, but you guys are– you're coming down at a very, very fast pace at an angle over the barracks towards the back end of the war camp."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh shit.","response":"DM: You can attempt to. Grog–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I begin to fart to slow the fall.\nORION: Who needs Featherfall? I can do it in a bunch!\nMARISHA: Ahh!","response":"DM: Everybody, at this point–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But wait, Dungeon Master?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Re-explain what's happening. So the carpet is falling, not as fast as it would, but–","response":"DM: Essentially, you guys are flying beside each other, the three that were falling, you guys swooped underneath and caught them, however it's too much weight to bear, the carpet's now–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How high are we at this second?","response":"DM: At this second, you're about 60-70 feet up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ohh.\nLIAM: And the closest building, the highest building under us is how tall?\nMARISHA: Oh, Jesus.","response":"DM: It's about 15 feet tall."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ohh.","response":"DM: Grog, however, goes into a full plummet. You guys have just caught the rest of them, you've all caught them, you're crashing down."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And did the Wind Wall thing work?","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll a concentration."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Everybody jump up in the air!","response":"DM: Your constitution modifier."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fucking shit. Not good. Seven.","response":"DM: The spell fizzles."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Unpause. How far are we from the tunnel that we were talking about?","response":"DM: From what you can see here, you're probably about 50 to 60 feet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're right over the camp, aren't we?","response":"DM: You're towards the back of it, thankfully, the barracks are towards the back of it, so maybe about 50 to 60 feet from the full tunnel."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Before where the drop is, and that's where that bottom tunnel is down there?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay.","response":"DM: You guys go crashing at an angle."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to brace to jump. I'm bracing to roll.\nLAURA: Yeah, we're all like bracing.\nMARISHA: Three-point landing!\nLIAM: I'm grabbing for Pike and going like this.\nLAURA: I have Scanlan!\nMARISHA: What's Grog doing?\nORION: Where's Grog at?\nLAURA: He's falling.\nLIAM: Grog's gone. Grog's down.","response":"DM: Grog is completely separate from you. He was flying, and lost concentration of his spell. Grog's like a stone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, Grog!\nORION: Can I leap towards him?\nTALIESIN: Off what?\nMARISHA: And do what?","response":"DM: Off of the carpet–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Off of the carpet! Yes!\nLIAM: Do what?\nLAURA: You leap off of the carpet?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check. With a disadvantage, because you are jumping off of a currently flimsy flying carpet to try and catch up to him."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.\nORION: Right now, while I'm doing this, I'm going to cast Featherfall on myself.\nTRAVIS: Wait, before, you gotta get to me first, because it will slow you too much.\nORION: Oh. It would, wouldn't it? I thought it was only when going down.\nTRAVIS: Gotta get to me first, motherfucker.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Whoa. Okay.","response":"DM: So what's your acrobatics check? The lower of the two."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You fall a lot.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Big things go down.\nORION: 15 and 13.","response":"DM: Okay. You manage to fumble out of the carpet, however, you are now just end-over-end falling now off of the side of the carpet on your own."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is tense.\nLAURA: This is tense.","response":"DM: You're having a hard time even seeing Grog now. The world's just spinning and spinning and spinning."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh God.\nTRAVIS: It's like Gravity.","response":"DM: You can attempt–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Now I'm going to cast Featherfall.","response":"DM: Go ahead, cast and roll concentration check. What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He rolled a 19. Which is good.","response":"DM: Okay. Featherfall gets to you just in time. Your descent slows. In that time, Grog has impacted."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fuck!\nLAURA: Oh no, Grog!\nLIAM: We're gonna hit, we're gonna hit. I'm shielding the healer.\nLAURA: I'm shielding Scanlan.","response":"DM: So you all brace for impact. The actual carpet's careening out of control. You can see there's just barely the top of a building you might be able to try and skim."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we jump onto the top of the building?","response":"DM: This is going to be up to the one who's been steering this whole time. Go ahead and make an intelligence check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Intelligence!\nLIAM: Intelligence?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I assist?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Thank God it's not me.\nMARISHA: Can we do nothing and–\nLIAM: Good, good, good, good. 24.","response":"DM: 24?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, so I'm pretty smart.","response":"DM: You just managed to skim the edge, which lessens your impact slightly, however, it does send you all into a full end-over-end topple."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Still holding a gnome!","response":"DM: Everyone. Everyone. Make an acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, god. Which one to roll, which one to roll.\nMARISHA: Oh, no. What's going on with Grog?\nLIAM: I guess that's what we'll find out afterwards.","response":"DM: Grog's impacted. He was falling faster than you guys were, he's six hundred pounds going into straight freefall. You guys had a little bit of a fall break."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ah, this is going terribly! I'm failing!\nORION: Do I have to do one also?","response":"DM: Everyone. Oh, except for you, because you're floating."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do the halflings– Shit! Do the gnomes get an advantage since the half-elves are protecting them?\nLAURA: Depending on how we roll?","response":"DM: It's based on how you guys roll, because you're the ones who are holding onto them."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, okay.\nLAURA: Welp, Scanlan. I'm sorry to let you know–\nTALIESIN: No.\nLIAM: Oh no!","response":"DM: So you got Pike?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I got Pike.","response":"DM: What'd you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 18.","response":"DM: Natural one."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 13.\nTRAVIS: 18.\nTALIESIN: 23.\nMARISHA: Four.","response":"DM: Okay, so half-damage for you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But I have a plus nine acrobatics! Plus nine acrobatics!\nLIAM: Doesn't matter.\nLAURA: Doesn't matter on a natural crit fail.\nTALIESIN: Still gonna knock me out.","response":"DM: Roll some fall damage here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm sorry, Scanlan!\nMARISHA: It's not gonna be good.\nTRAVIS: You're gonna be like an ACME cartoon and just leave a (pff)\nLAURA and LIAM: (pff)","response":"DM: 18 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm out.\nMARISHA: You're out again?\nLAURA: You're unconscious again?\nTALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: He didn't have a lot of hit points left."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no, we're all dead!\nMARISHA: This the second time Grog's almost fallen to his death.","response":"DM: 18 points of damage to you. The rest of you all take 36 points of fall damage, except for Grog."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Everybody, everybody?\nLAURA: Everybody? As a group, like we all failed as a group?","response":"DM: Well, no, no, sorry. You succeeded, you rolled a–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 18.","response":"DM: 18, so you would also take half-damage, so you would take 18 as well."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I take–","response":"DM: You take half that as well, thanks to his roll as well."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I rolled an 18.\nASHLEY: Everybody in this club getting hit points.","response":"DM: Right, you were in full plummet, you can reduce the damage slightly."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well, I was very graceful on the way down.","response":"DM: Yeah, you take 45 points of damage from the impact, Grog."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 45?","response":"DM: 45 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh.\nLIAM: It was halved, so eight.","response":"DM: And leave a small crater from the impact."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Thank you.\nMARISHA: You know what, that could've been worse.\nLAURA: And I take 35?","response":"DM: You and Scanlan both take 36, which puts Scanlan into a negative as well, because he wasn't– he was not at–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, no! He was fully healed.\nTRAVIS: Nope.","response":"DM: No, he wasn't."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (Softly) Fuck.\nLIAM: No, sorry, no.","response":"DM: So, you all tumble end over end, come to rest."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We just crash-landed in a war camp.","response":"DM: Yeah. On the far end of it, thankfully."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh boy.","response":"DM: You guys can hear the bells and the horns going in the distance. It looks like all the rest of the folks that were stationed here moved towards the center. You managed to arc over them, but they're going to be here shortly."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are we near their big war machines?","response":"DM: No, the ballistae are on the opposite–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: So we can see the ledge and that cavern where we were, where we found the–","response":"DM: Well, the ledge is back in the other direction. You guys are going towards the tunnel on the opposite side."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Vax is pulling up Pike onto her feet and dragging her towards Scanlan, 'cause I know how fucked up he was from the last battle.\nASHLEY: Where's Scanlan? How close–","response":"DM: Okay, you guys– and you, you're kinda getting up on your knees, coughing–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How, how–\nASHLEY: Percy's out, let's go–\nLIAM: But so is Scanlan.","response":"DM: Percy's just face-down in the ground, scrapes across the side of his face."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Scanlan's out, too? Fuck.\nLIAM: Scanlan's out, too, right?","response":"DM: Scanlan's also out."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: How about– I'll give him a level three potion and you go heal Scanlan.\nLAURA: No, you, here, you take care of him, I'm right next to Scanlan,","response":"DM: You guys are roughly about ten feet from each other from the impact, just, you were scattered, and then you kind of regrouped."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Can we see people running towards us?","response":"DM: Not yet, but you assume it's only a short period of time."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, yeah, we have some time left–\nMARISHA: We don't, I don't know.","response":"DM: Grog, what you at?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 39.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: She's doing a Mass Healing–\nASHLEY: A Mass Healing Word.","response":"DM: Okay. You barely get yourself out of the crater. That's gonna suck tomorrow!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Mass Healing Word?\nLIAM: You take Scanlan, I'll take Percy.\nLAURA: Okay! I'm gonna–\nLIAM: Healing potions out.","response":"DM: As this is happening, Percy, go ahead and make a death saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh!\nTRAVIS: A death saving throw?\nLIAM: Sorry, here's three–\nTALIESIN: Is that– Is that just–","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A nine.","response":"DM: That's a fail, so mark off one fail on your death saving throw on your sheet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)\nASHLEY and LAURA: No no no no!\nTRAVIS: Oh shit!\nLIAM: Sorry I'm late, Percy.","response":"DM: Scanlan does make his."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: But I'm doing–\nLIAM: I'm pinching Percy's nose and pouring it in his mouth.\nLAURA: And I'm pouring some down Scanlan's throat.\nLIAM: I think so.\nLAURA: Yeah?","response":"DM: 2d4 plus two. Go ahead and roll that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (whispers) 2d4 plus two.\nTRAVIS: I'm taking a level two potion, myself. Just–\nTALIESIN: 2d4 plus two?","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Eight. Eight for Percy.","response":"DM: That's four–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh! So I'm at plus eight now?\nMATT and LIAM: Yes.\nLIAM: You're up.","response":"DM: Scanlan also comes to consciousness."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 2d4? That's pathetic.","response":"DM: That's the cheapest one you've got. 2d4 plus two."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Let's get the fuck out of here and they can–\nLAURA: Okay, fine.\nTALIESIN: She was gonna do a Mass Healing–\nMARISHA: Yeah, what's your Mass Healing Word?\nORION: I'd like to know– on the way down, I was doing a little chant and I was expending my sorcery points to do Flexible Casting, so I regain a slot spell on my third-level spells.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: As we're getting up, can I see– Is the camp nearby, where the prisoners are? Is that anywhere near us?","response":"DM: No, that's towards the center of the camp."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We gotta keep moving. I pull out another corked potion and slap it into Percy's hand.\nMARISHA: Yeah, we gotta go.\nLIAM: And then grab him by the wrist and just start walking.\nTALIESIN: I'm up.\nMARISHA: Here, wait. Save the potion, I cast Healing Word on Percy.\nASHLEY: Hold on, I'm gonna do a Mass Cure Wounds.\nLAURA: Mass Cure Wounds?\nLAURA: Can we stealth while we're doing this, or are we too, like, injured?\nORION: No, this is–","response":"DM: No, you guys are just bolting at this point. You're not even concentrating on stealth right now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Bolting it, right.\nTALIESIN: This is, this is–","response":"DM: Plus, with the group– Basically, a few of you would stealth and the rest of you would be left in the dust, so you're just kind of all pushing for speed at this point."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nORION: Yeah.","response":"DM: You all manage to push towards the back of the entire war camp, into this tunnel. Hearing behind you the distant echoing shouts of approximately 30-plus duergar heading in your direction. You hear a few other ballista bolts hitting the wall above you of the stone."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Are we all in the tunnel?","response":"DM: You guys have now pushed into the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I wait for everybody to pass and I cast all my Grand Columns.","response":"DM: Okay, how many can you–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Three.","response":"DM: Three per spell? And how many spell levels do you have currently?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's it, that's what I did the SP for, so that I could cast this right now.","response":"DM: Right. So you have one."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I have none in my column.","response":"DM: Right. How many spell castings did you have left? Two?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, I had one.\nASHLEY: (whispers) 24.\nTALIESIN: 24?\nLAURA: 24 mass?\nASHLEY: 24 mass cure.","response":"DM: One left. So you get three columns. It's 30 feet wide."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, she just healed everybody for 24 points.\nORION: (whispers) Oh, it's 30–\nMARISHA: Oh, dope.","response":"DM: Okay, everyone heals for 24 points. Add that up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, I feel good!\nLAURA: I feel pretty good now.\nTRAVIS: Dude! Kick that shit.\nLAURA: What what!\nORION: It's not enough, is it?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay. Including myself?\nLIAM and TRAVIS: Yes.\nORION: Are the caves stone? Like the cave–","response":"DM: The walls are stone."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Ugh, that's huge.\nLAURA: Oh my god, it's major.\nORION: Can I like, do it from the side? Can I attempt to?","response":"DM: Pillars go straight up, unfortunately. It's the nature of the spell's creation."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well wait, I can do what you're trying to do.\nORION: Oh! Oh yeah!\nMARISHA: I do Wall Of Stone.\nORION: There you go!","response":"DM: Okay! So as you're trying to figure this out, Keyleth steps over–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm like, oh, is this, oh–\nORION: It's– Oh!\nMARISHA: Sorry! You should've just– I would've– they're not very–\nORION: They're columns.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nORION: You're good. The wall's good.\nMARISHA: Right.\nORION: Good.\nLAURA: Are we running? I don't know what you guys are doing. What's happening right now?","response":"DM: As you guys are doing this and rushing in, you're realizing there's one member of your party that you haven't had a lot of time with–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA and LIAM: Clarota!","response":"DM: – that you didn't think about until this moment."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Clarota, yeah. Clarota.\nMARISHA: Oh, yeah!","response":"DM: You now see, kind of, like, floating, via levitation ability, about 30 feet away, slowly descending towards you, as you're putting up the wall of stone–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! Wait! Hold on!\nTRAVIS: Come on Squidworth, over here!","response":"DM: Two bolts go firing towards him; one whooshes overhead, a second one–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Clarota!","response":"DM: (impact sound) – through his back, out the front of his chest–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No!","response":"DM: – off the shoulder."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Come on! We need to save him!\nLIAM: He's gotta have more than ten hit points.\nORION: Recess the wall, recess the wall!\nMARISHA: Wait!","response":"DM: You can see now– and the bolt itself is about four feet long, made of this long, jagged, pointed arrow tip."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, man.","response":"DM: Clarota begins to falter, and begins to hover towards you, almost, like, trying to swim through the air in your direction."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we run out, try to grab him?\nASHLEY: Can I grab him, hang on to him?\nORION: Oh!","response":"DM: He's about 20 feet from you now, you can try and reach out and put your hands towards him–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Boom!\nLAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nTRAVIS: I take off and run to him.\nORION: Now I cast Glacial Blast, right under him, like a slide, right towards us– and catch him.","response":"DM: Okay. So as you guys are running towards him, instead, this giant crystalline form of ice just–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Awesome.","response":"DM: – as it descends, two more bolts come towards him. Both (whoosh, whoosh). At this distance, in the darkness of the cavern, it's kind of hard for them to get a bead on him. Both just pass overhead. With eyes kind of lolling, Clarota comes down and hits the edge of the slide, and almost loses consciousness at that moment, sliding through the ice. You guys manage to capture, grappling his arms, lift him to his feet–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And now, Wall Of Stone.","response":"DM: You all make it into the tunnel, Keyleth turns around, raising her hands, the actual blackened stonework of this tunnel shakes for a second, and then a giant, thick wall of natural rock closes off the entire tunnel behind you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Nice.\nLAURA: I love you, Trinket!\nLIAM: Completely seals it?\nMARISHA: Oh, gosh.","response":"DM: Completely seals it. You guys are now in complete darkness."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ooh! Light!","response":"DM: As the light hits, you can hear, just on the other side of the surface of the stone wall, javelins, other things are being shot at the stone wall–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah!","response":"DM: – but it's keeping it at bay. You guys are now at the wall, and behind you the tunnel continues into a passage you haven't seen yet."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Whatever we do from here, I sprinkle dust of tracelessness behind us the whole time like a fucking flower girl.\nLIAM: They could have magic in their possession, they could use magic as well, so let's move.\nLAURA: Yeah, they could get through it.\nORION: Yes.\nTALIESIN: Will a healing potion work on Clarota?\nASHLEY: So, Clarota's with us?\nLAURA: Clarota's with us.\nASHLEY: Can I go over to Clarota and try to heal him?\nLAURA: Don't get too close, he might just suck in your brain.","response":"DM: You can certainly try."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I've got a potion, so–\nMARISHA: Grog?\nASHLEY: Should we give him a potion?\nTRAVIS: What?\nMARISHA: Do you have any ale?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I do have a cask, actually.\nMARISHA: I think I need a drink.\nTRAVIS: Right. I'll–\nTALIESIN: What's a level two potion do?\nTRAVIS: There you are.","response":"DM: A level two potion would be 4d4 plus four."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I go and hold his shoulders–\nMARISHA: I really need a drink.\nTRAVIS: – whilst she tries to heal him, just in case he gets all sucky on her.\nASHLEY: I think he's gonna give him a potion.\nTRAVIS: Oh.\nTALIESIN: I am.\nTRAVIS: That's much less–\nLAURA: No!\nLIAM: Felicia Day, that's not nice!\nTRAVIS: Hey!\nTALIESIN: 17 points of healing.","response":"DM: Okay. 17 points to Clarota."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What'd she say?","response":"DM: Which– administering a potion to a mind flayer is an experience that very few in this world have probably ever, or ever will, experience. As you kind of reach over, grab his shoulder, you look for where to put it, and the tendrils kind of, like, flail about, but begin to– they, as he notices what you're doing, kind of relax and open up, and you can now see the circular, lamprey-like, toothy maw of the mind flayer. It's a very disturbing, disgusting image, with this jagged, yellow teeth, in a circular form. You pop the cork, and just pour it in. As you do, you see the wounds across Clarota's form begin to seal. The arrow is still stuck in its torso."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we try to pull it out?\nASHLEY: Try to break off the part–","response":"DM: You can certainly try."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I got it (snap)!","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a– this would be a medicine check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do you wanna do that, Grog?\nTRAVIS: I'll do the breaking part.","response":"DM: It's iron. It's solid iron."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: My medicine's a four.\nLAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: Breaking it off is not gonna work."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What's your medicine?\nTRAVIS: So? Zero.","response":"DM: You have to pull it from the wound."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. I'll try.\nTALIESIN: Who has a medicine?\nLAURA: So what are you–\nASHLEY: A four.\nASHLEY: What does everybody have?","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do it!\nASHLEY: Roll this guy? Okay. Nine?","response":"DM: A nine."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Sorry!","response":"DM: So. You take your moment, you view up where the puncture wound is, with a little bit of Grog's help, you both grab the edge, and you're like, 'On three. One, two, three, pull!' You pull through the wound, not against the arrow–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right.","response":"DM: – 'cause that would just tear everything out in the process, but nevertheless, in doing so, Clarota does take an additional eight points of damage."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm sorry.","response":"DM: But, the wound is now no longer a giant–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Able to be healed.","response":"DM: – it's now able to be healed completely, so. Clarota takes a moment and kind of grasps the wound."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I hand him a little healing potion, and say, sorry.","response":"DM: Shatters the glass. At which point, you now hear (impact sounds) against the stone wall."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should move!\nASHLEY: Time to go!\nLIAM: Let's keep moving, yes? Yes.\nTRAVIS: I pick up Clarota. Yeah, why not.\nTRAVIS: I pick up Clarota and we start running balls.\nLAURA: Is he good enough to walk or is he–","response":"DM: He's good enough to walk with you guys. Well–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well, how about I put one arm under his face and help him.","response":"DM: So you're helping him."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, that's– hold on a second. I take out the flying carpet–\nLAURA: We still have the flying carpet?\nLIAM: Sure we do!","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Here, sit on this, Clarota.\nLAURA: If you need it.\nLIAM: That'd be easier, yes.","response":"DM: Clarota gets up on the carpet and– “Thank you.” The carpet kind of drifts alongside you guys. You guys are pushing backwards towards the cavern. The tunnel kind of begins to pinch a little bit. It gets to about a 15-foot width before it opens up again. You're about a hundred feet back. You can now see it opening into a– what looks like an extension of the war camp."}
{"prompt":"(all groan)\nLAURA: We should've gone down! What were we thinking?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That guy was lying.\nLAURA: Well, he said go down. We didn't go down.\nLIAM: 21 for me.\nLAURA: 13 for me. I like how my passive perception is way higher than any rolls that I ever do.","response":"DM: I do keep that– I keep tabs on that."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 22.\nMARISHA: Are we all doing perception rolls?","response":"DM: For the most part, we've got a few rolls, and it worked fine. Looking inside though, this camp looks like it's been abandoned."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, good!","response":"DM: It looks like it was built, and then the expansion into the war camp you just escaped from seemed to be the next step. Like it's slowly advancing and this section of it has been in disuse. As you push in towards the center of the camp you can see there's older campfires, lots of the tents have like partially collapsed. Dust has gathered."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm keeping my eyes peeled for useful shit.","response":"DM: Okay. Looking around as well, you see all the equipment. Any pieces that would be of interest have either been taken– either destroyed and are broken or have probably been moved into the war camp. You glance through a couple of the tents. Looking about, it's definitely been abandoned. It no longer serves a purpose and anything of use has been stripped and taken. This cavern is maybe about 60 feet up or so. It's a little domed section, and you can now see there are two exit tunnels to this section. One that is kind of straight ahead, a little bit to the left. And one that veers off to the direct left of you. So if you're looking straight from the direction you came, there is one right ahead of you, a little bit to the left and one that goes quickly to the left."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should we take the left one?\nTRAVIS: Which one's the left one?\nMARISHA: He mentioned the left.\nLAURA: Yeah, so maybe we should stay left.","response":"DM: Yeah, do that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Clarota, do you know anything about these passages?\nLAURA: Do you remember anything?\nMARISHA: Wait, why did he say that? Why did you say that?","response":"DM: 'Cause they're both kind of left. It's a joke. Clarota takes a moment and kind of looks at you, kind of– his breath. “I've not been this far up these tunnels. It's too dangerous this close to the war camp. I would've been killed in a second.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What about the general's memory? Anything there?","response":"DM: He kind of closes his eyes for a second. “One of these leads below, one of them leads to the surface. I can't recall which.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we go up and–\nTRAVIS: Let's split up!\nLAURA: No, can we go next to the one on the far left and see if I sense any like wind coming down, is there–","response":"DM: Going to the one on the far left, as you're stepping you hear a (muffled impact noise)–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, well, good.","response":"DM: – against the distant stone wall that you put up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I think we get to pick one here.\nMARISHA: Are there any–\nASHLEY: He did say go left.","response":"DM: As you head to the tunnel, you don't sense any sort of temperature change, but it does seem to steady off into a decline that curves to the left."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should do that.\nTALIESIN: Sounds good.\nMARISHA: Do you mean, are there like– is there any wildlife, any bats, any type of animals, anything like that?","response":"DM: We shall say, a general sense of this area, you look and you can see, in this area, unlike the previous sections, there are small clusters of bats on the ceiling."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to–","response":"DM: As apparently they have an exit of some kind to the surface."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast Beast Sense on one of the bats.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I'm going to channel myself through the bat and I'm going to make him fly down the far left tunnel.","response":"DM: Okay. So as you guys are walking over there, one of the bats–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Good call.","response":"DM: – heads down into the tunnel, continues into the darkness."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I just see–","response":"DM: From the echolocation, which is a very strange sensation, you haven't really done this before for a bat and it's a very weird experience."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wow, guys, this is really trippy.\nTALIESIN: We just hear (bat sounds).","response":"DM: It continues about a steady 40-degree decline that goes further and further down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Keep going down. Down, down, down.","response":"DM: Eventually, you get to a point where the bat is out of your sphere of influence and you lose your connection to the bat."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Keep going down?\nMARISHA: Well, I didn't really see much, but definitely there is a pretty steep incline. We could try it again and go down the other one.\nLIAM: This is a coin flip.\nLAURA: I think we keep going down. Just stick with it.\nORION: Hold on! Incline means up.\nLAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: No, it's a decline."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Decline.\nORION: Decline means down.\nLAURA: Well, then let's go with the decline. Yes?\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nLAURA: Let's do it!\nTALIESIN: We go. With haste.\nLAURA: Yes.\nTRAVIS: With haste!\nLAURA: With stealth! With Dust of Tracelessness behind us.\nTRAVIS: Hey, flower girl!\nLAURA: Flower girl!\nORION: Actually, there's two tunnels, right?","response":"DM: There are two tunnels, yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And one's smaller than the other?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hm.","response":"DM: Yes?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: There's no right answer here. It's just–\nORION: I know.\nTALIESIN: Yeah.\nORION: How big is the– how wide is the smaller one that we're going through?","response":"DM: There's one, the one on the far end, the one that does not appear to be a decline, seems to be the widest of the two."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I pull out a torch. Will you light my torch?\nORION: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Nice.\nTRAVIS: Are we going to the left?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: I take off running to the left.\nLAURA: Oh, god. Grog!","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Running, running?\nTRAVIS: Running!\nLIAM: Really running?\nTRAVIS: Running to the left.\nORION: Oh man, oh no!","response":"DM: Grog goes charging into the darkened tunnel to the very left–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Grog! Stop!\nORION: Let's go, everybody!\nMARISHA: There he goes!\nLAURA: I'm gonna take off after him.","response":"DM: The heavy footsteps of Grog disappearing into the darkness–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We take off after him, 'cause he needs help.\nORION: Let's go!\nMARISHA: Grog, Grog! Don't run too far ahead– He's gone.","response":"DM: You guys give chase."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.\nLIAM: It's like having Goofy as a party member.\nASHLEY: Hodor!\nTRAVIS: Hah. Hodor.\nASHLEY: Hodor.","response":"DM: As you guys catch up to Grog, which isn't too hard–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What? I'm fast.","response":"DM: Are you going to a full sprint, though?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, no, no. I mean. A leisurely jog.","response":"DM: Right. You catch up to Grog. The tunnel itself is about 30 feet wide, 20 feet tall. And it is a slow, continuously gradual decline and curve to the left."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can you do another wall?","response":"DM: Like a spiral, downward."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No?\nTRAVIS: Maybe we could do a cave-in.\nLAURA: Well, that might be dangerous.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, but it'd be fun.","response":"DM: You guys continue for another 20 or so minutes down, before it opens up into a small alcove to the right, but the tunnel continues. This alcove, it's about 35, 40 feet in, and it looks like there are remnants here of a camp that was set up once. Similar to the war camp, but once again abandoned, or at least currently not in use."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Any useful shit?\nLAURA: Can we go, oh! Can we go in? We should probably rest, heal up, get our spells back. Can you cast the illusion terrain and make it look like there's no hole in the cavern here?\nMARISHA: No. I can't, today. I'm sorry.\nORION: If this is where we're gonna be chilling, I can seal off that tunnel still.\nLAURA: But we have to be able to get back out.\nORION: Right.\nTRAVIS: Not necessarily.\nASHLEY: If I–\nLIAM: No! If you seal off the passage, right, we keep going down, and if that's a dead end– it's probably not– if it is, can't we rest and use the same spell to open it up?\nORION: No, it's permanent.\nLIAM: That sucks.\nORION: But we would just have Grog hack away at it for a while–\nTRAVIS: Thank you!\nORION: It can be, you know, destroyed.\nTRAVIS: They do call me 'Grog the Locksmith.'\nORION: Right!\nTRAVIS: They don't call me that.\nLAURA: Can we go in and look at the camp and see, like, stealthily–","response":"DM: Yeah!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: – check out what the camp is?\nMARISHA: I can make it really foggy.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an investigate check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I could do that.\nLIAM: Yes, we know that about you.\nTRAVIS: Oh, I can too!\nLIAM: What about in the game, though?\nMARISHA: I can make it look like a–\nLAURA: 20.\nMARISHA: Well, that's a different story.","response":"DM: As you guys are having this conversation, Vex does a quick glance over, there are about four tents that are still set up, there appears to be a small ring where a fire was set up, and you can see kind of bits of charcoal–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes!","response":"DM: – and bits of long, long, long forgotten burnt meat, remnants, charcoal, and such there."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I have two firewood bundles.\nTALIESIN: I'm gonna look for a seal, to see if there's a seal anywhere around.","response":"DM: You do see, on one of the walls–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Bam!","response":"DM: – there is a similar seal of Bahamut."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) Oh! This was her camp!\nTALIESIN: Kima was here!\nLAURA: Kima was here!\nMARISHA: #kimawashere.","response":"DM: However, there are four tents here–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.\nORION: Kima was here.","response":"DM: Which means– previously you saw just one, from what you saw. There are four here."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: She had babies.\nTRAVIS: Oh.","response":"DM: However, glancing through, you do notice that there are a few discarded travel bags–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Mine! Mine! Mine!\nMARISHA: Ooh!","response":"DM: – carrying rope, grappling hooks, general cluster of torches, about eight in total–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, that's nice. Torch, torch, torch, torch.\nTRAVIS: Thank you! Bag of holding, bag of holding.","response":"DM: And as you glance about you can see, in this alcove, looking at the dirt itself, it looks like there was a serious struggle. You can start seeing drag mark–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I use Tracking and see what happened, like Prince Humperdink, please? Can do?","response":"DM: Ah, well, this is part of your investigation roll, essentially."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, okay.","response":"DM: Unless you want to track to where the tracks went, that's a different story. That's–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, can I see who was attacked first? Does it look like Kima was attacked, or she–","response":"DM: It's hard to tell, you see some of the footsteps, and some of the drag marks, while mostly worn over, elements do show some of the fairer folk. The duergar have a very distinct footprint or size. You do see one that resembles more of, like, gnomish or halfling origin. You see drag marks in the dirt, you see other individuals, looks like there were chunks of rock that have been chopped off the side of the wall that look fresh, where you can see the soot that has settled into this part of the cavern is no longer visible where these scratch marks basically took off and exposed fresh rock."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The drag marks, do they lead outside of the alcove and down?","response":"DM: They do, and they lead down the tunnel further."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Let's go that way, or are we resting?\nLAURA: Do we need to rest? I mean–\nLIAM: I think we should rest.\nORION: I need to rest.\nLAURA: – I feel like we need to get our spells back, otherwise we're just gonna get killed.\nORION: Yes.\nMARISHA: Are we being chased right now?\nTALIESIN: Possibly.\nORION: Possibly.\nMARISHA: Are people hot on our tail?\nORION: Possibly.\nTALIESIN: We can rest in shifts.\nLAURA: Yeah. I guess that's the best thing to do.\nTRAVIS: I'll stay awake.\nLIAM: I'm totally fine at the moment, so I'll stay awake too.\nORION: Should I seal the tunnel?\nMARISHA: I need to sleep.\nLAURA: Maybe seal the tunnel behind us, yeah, so that–\nLIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: – if they do come, they have to like, try to get through.\nASHLEY: I can stay, I can stay awake too, I'm okay.\nORION: Cool.\nASHLEY: So maybe everybody sleep–\nORION: So I do.","response":"DM: Okay. So you use your spell, you seal off the tunnel with pillars. You can just barely get most of the entranceway covered, there's a couple of small slivers and spaces between."}
{"prompt":"ORION: But we would sure hear them, if they were–\nLAURA: Trying to get through, yeah.","response":"DM: Yeah. If they were."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah. I've got two firewood bundles in the bag of Ikea holding.\nTALIESIN: I don't think we need a fire.\nLIAM: I don't think it's a good idea.\nASHLEY: Do we need a fire?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: We're fine. It's warm down here.","response":"DM: It's fairly warm."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.\nORION: Oh.\nTRAVIS: Then, no?\nLIAM: We've got Tiberius, if he's awake, can cast Light, let's just go into one of these tents.\nTRAVIS: I wanna burn something.\nLAURA: I know.\nMARISHA: Yeah, two to a tent.\nLAURA: You can keep burning a torch.\nMARISHA: We can each have our own tent! There's enough.\nLAURA: Stick it in the ground.\nTRAVIS: Is there anything made of wood down here?\nORION: I actually have to rest completely, so I can't do shifts.\nTRAVIS: I want to set it on fire.","response":"DM: Okay. Fair enough."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I need all my spell slots.\nMARISHA: I need to sleep as well.","response":"DM: What wood there is, is used charcoal in the abandoned fire pit, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah, but can you–\nTRAVIS: I wanted to pyro shit.","response":"DM: You guys get set up?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I pull out some dice, so that Grog and I can gamble while everyone are sleeping.\nTRAVIS: Ooh!","response":"DM: Fair enough."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How much does a rest heal? Out of curiosity?","response":"DM: A rest heals you to full."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, excellent.\nLAURA: Oh, sweet! Yeah, let's fully rest.\nTALIESIN: Do I have time to do a quick engineering feat, as well?","response":"DM: You do not have–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, okay. Never mind.","response":"DM: Like at this point, I mean, you could– what're you trying to do? I should say."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Make an explosive arrow. I'm just in a mood.","response":"DM: Do you have any currently built explosives?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, but I have gunpowder.","response":"DM: You know what, I'll let you go ahead and try it with just your tinker's kit–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.\nLAURA: Tinker's?","response":"DM: It's gonna be a difficult–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's fine!","response":"DM: – roll, but go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What do I add? Am I just straight roll?","response":"DM: You add your proficiency bonus, which is, the tinker's kit is four."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, okay. Proficiency bonus. 15?","response":"DM: 15? Okay, okay. You manage to fasten what appears to be a black powder, impact-based explosive to the tip of an arrow. It's a little weighty and unwieldy, it might not be the most accurate thing in the world, but if it hits it's probably gonna pack a punch."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. I have another gift.\nLAURA: You do?\nTALIESIN: Explosive arrow!\nLAURA: This is the best day ever!\nTALIESIN: It's a bit iffy.\nLIAM: (Cary Elwes voice) Gently! Gently!\nORION: It's a bit iffy.\nLAURA: Gently!\nMARISHA: Don't trust it!\nTALIESIN: It's a bit iffy.\nLAURA: I gingerly put it in my quiver.\nORION: More like a shotgun.\nTALIESIN: It'll get better. It'll get better.\nTRAVIS: Can you make me an explosive axe?","response":"DM: You very gingerly place it within your quiver."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I don't think you want an explosive axe.","response":"DM: It's heavy in the tip."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Why?","response":"DM: It's one of those things where, you know, shooting it is going to be an interesting challenge."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should I keep it away from the rest of my stuff?","response":"DM: That's up to you!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is there a possibility it could explode just–\nORION: You haven't even played with your hammer yet!","response":"DM: I dunno."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's very unlikely to explode on by itself. 'Cause it needs to be moving at a high speed. But it's just not the best thing ever.\nLAURA: Maybe I won't keep it straight behind my head.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, no. Not straight behind.\nLAURA: Let's just kind of keep it down at my waist–\nLIAM: Off to the side.\nLAURA: With the dagger, maybe.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is that cool?\nTALIESIN: The next one will be better.\nTALIESIN: Yep.","response":"DM: As the evening transpires, you all get your evenings of rest, you guys kind of keeping watch, gambling away. At a certain point, throughout the evening, something perks up your ears. You begin hearing footsteps, many footsteps."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Many footsteps.\nLAURA: (gasps) Oh no. How many is many? A lot.\nLIAM: How many does it sound like?","response":"DM: It sounds like anywhere between six, ten, more–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: From, right, from up? Or down.","response":"DM: From above, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: From above.\nTRAVIS: Up. Oh.\nLAURA: We should wake up.\nASHLEY: From above?\nTRAVIS: Like, the ceiling? Or–\nLAURA: Well like the– no, no, no. From like–\nASHLEY: Like where you have the–\nLAURA: Up the path, right?","response":"DM: Up the path you guys came from."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wait. Grog and I are the only ones awake, right?\nASHLEY: That he shielded off?\nORION: Yeah, it's sealed.\nTRAVIS: Yep.","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Grog and I are the only ones awake.\nORION: Right.\nLIAM: Do we lay low, and hold quiet in these tents? Or do we get everyone up?\nLAURA: They're gonna know, 'cause we blocked off the friggin' path! I'm asleep. Sorry.\nLIAM: Yeah.\nASHLEY: I'm still awake.\nTRAVIS: Lay low. Let them come.\nLIAM: I think so.\nLAURA: (whispers) What? You're just really–\nTRAVIS: Keep sleeping and shut up!\nLIAM: No, no, no, I rouse my sister quietly.\nLAURA: What?\nTRAVIS: Oh. Fine.\nLIAM: She's in this tent.\nTRAVIS: Wake her up.\nLAURA: What's going–\nLIAM: (whispers) Quiet.\nLIAM: Yeah.\nLAURA: I stealth.","response":"DM: The three of you make a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I stealth as well.","response":"DM: You do, Grog. You do."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: God damn.\nTRAVIS: Fuck yeah! A two!\nLAURA: I should stop rolling this fucking dice.\nTRAVIS: 17.\nASHLEY: Wait, are you guys asleep?\nLIAM: 23.\nMARISHA: I'm still passed out.\nLAURA: Oh! Yeah, that was a one. This, by the way–","response":"DM: Again?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: – was given to me by Wil Wheaton.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Wake up your sister.\nLAURA: Thank you, Wil.\nTRAVIS: It was just us boys–","response":"DM: Thank you, Wil."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: – and then you woke her up.\nASHLEY: Wait, I was awake too.","response":"DM: You were awake too?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yes.","response":"DM: At this point? You weren't resting?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What. You?\nLAURA: No, she was–\nTRAVIS: Oh, she was actually awake.\nASHLEY: Because I was, I was still at full–\nLAURA: (whispers) But you needed your spells.","response":"DM: Okay, then–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh, but my spells? Actually–","response":"DM: If you're not resting you don't get your spells back."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, you need–\nASHLEY: – I fell asleep! I totally forgot. I am sound asleep.\nMARISHA: Totally forgot I fell asleep!\nASHLEY: I was dreaming–\nTRAVIS: She dreamed, in the dream she was still awake.","response":"DM: You are welcome to stay awake if you want, but you just won't get your spells back."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I was dreaming, it was real–","response":"DM: You'd probably be exhausted."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: – I was so confused, by my dream.\nTALIESIN: You were just going all Inception on us.\nLIAM: You know, when you can't fall asleep–\nASHLEY: My perception was off.\nLIAM: – and you're like, am I dreaming? Or is this the dream? Or is it real?\nTALIESIN: Spin the top. Spin the top.\nASHLEY: I was totally sleeping.\nLIAM: And you wake up, and you have to pee, it's hard to tell.\nASHLEY: And I spaced.\nTRAVIS: So the three of us are up.\nASHLEY: I was asleep.\nLIAM: Shake it off.\nLAURA: Thank you, thank you.","response":"DM: – who, who, 'Huh? What? What?'"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ah– what? What?","response":"DM: When you wake her up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sh! Sh.","response":"DM: You guys quietly wait–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh no, that was a bad expression!\nLIAM: Daggers out! Daggers out!\nASHLEY: Or that was good?\nLAURA: Oh no. Did eyebrows go up?\nTALIESIN: (whistles In the Hall of the Mountain King)","response":"DM: The footsteps progress through, and you– there's no light source, as duergar for the most part do not require light to see in the tunnels."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we see through the dark– but we can see in the dark?","response":"DM: You guys have low-light vision, not dark vision."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Not dark vision.\nLAURA: There's no light in this area at all?\nTRAVIS: No! It's balls-ass dark!\nLIAM: There's no fire–","response":"DM: No, it is pitch black. You just hear–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: On purpose no fire.","response":"DM: – you just hear the footprints go by."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Good thing we didn't make a campfire!\nLIAM: Sh, sh!","response":"DM: You hear them approach the outskirts of the alcove."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I have dark vision, gosh dang it!","response":"DM: But you're asleep."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm fucking sleeping.","response":"DM: Yes, you are."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Bad choices, all around!\nLIAM: They're going!","response":"DM: As the footsteps approach the outskirts of the alcove, the rest of you sleeping soundly, unaware of what's transpiring– A few moments pass, and the footprints appear to be passing, past, downward into the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well, maybe just leave it there.\nLIAM: Last time I did that I got kicked in the nuts, very hard.\nTRAVIS: And liked it.\nASHLEY: What a good sleep I've had! I have all my spells back!","response":"DM: That also puts a level of exhaustion– So. There is one level of exhaustion on both of you currently."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sure. So what does that do to us?\nLAURA: Oh no.\nORION: Ah. You fools!","response":"DM: It just means any ability checks you take–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: So, any skills you take are at disadvantage until you get a full night's rest."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'll take one more level two potion right now.\nLIAM: Skill? Skill. Okay.\nTRAVIS: One more level two potion.","response":"DM: Okay. You can use– remember, you can use your hit dice to heal still, before you start throwing potions around. If you have a moment to rest–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hit dice. We forgot about that because it wasn't there before.","response":"DM: Yeah. (sings) Fifth Edition! Before you start throwing potions around, 'cause remember, you're far away from civilization right now, you have a very limited number of potions now to lead you through here, unless you find some way to return to the surface."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just for emergencies.\nORION: What's happening?\nLIAM: In combat.","response":"DM: So. You all eventually come back to consciousness, in this darkened alcove, pitch black. It is still warm, slight smell of soot and dust in the air, what do you guys want to do?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I have a question.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Outside of existence. Tiberius put up a stone, right?","response":"DM: Mm-hm."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But I didn't hear any (impact sounds), right?\nLAURA: Oh, no, he put it up next to our alcove. So, they just kind of passed by our alcove.","response":"DM: It basically matched the wall as you guys went around."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh. So we sealed ourselves into this little pocket?\nLAURA: Yes. We did.\nLIAM: Oh. We didn't even friggin' need to hide in the tent! We were in a little bubble of air!\nLAURA: Well, no, well, it's pillars, though, they could have–","response":"DM: You're not completely in there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: – they could have seen us.\nLIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: He could block off most of it, there's like little spaces between–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think we should all freshen up, since it's a new day!\nLIAM: Right. We're all healed, maybe– Does anyone have to pee? Or perhaps–\nLAURA: Yeah, that.\nASHLEY: Yeah.\nLAURA: That.\nORION: Is anyone particularly dirty?\nLAURA: Intermission!","response":"DM: Indeed. So. This, given the point in time that you all wake from your slumber, we'll continue this in a few minutes. In the meantime, we're gonna go ahead and go to our intermission break. See you guys back here in about 12 minutes or so."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yep.","response":"DM: And so we will pick it back up. So as you all regain consciousness and prepare yourselves for the day ahead, once again, you've gone a number of days without sunlight, without any vision of the sky. It's a very disorienting experience for all of you who are unfamiliar with subterranean territory. Even though you are rested, you don't feel rested. There's kinks in your back from the rocky floor. The best you could find yourself any sort of comfort here is from whatever you have on your back. Most of you sleep in your armor out of necessity and paranoia. As consciousness comes to you, you guys are able to try and find your way back out now that you've been sealed in."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we squish through the little cracks?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We have to cut it down?","response":"DM: You have about a five, six-inch gap between each of them."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So we've gotta break our way out of here, Grog.\nTRAVIS: Oh, do I get to hit things?","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Start smacking the wall.\nTRAVIS: My god.\nASHLEY: Can I just give it a try, just to see? Try make a dent.","response":"DM: Yeah, go ahead and make an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And just to try it out, I would like bring out the flaming hammer of–","response":"DM: Actually, for this I would say it's a straight strength check. This is just physicality, strength against the stonework."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Might need to take your armor off.\nASHLEY: Strength is?\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nLAURA: Oh, it's right here.\nTRAVIS: 23.\nTRAVIS: With the hammer.\nASHLEY: Ten.\nMARISHA: We're playing pillar pinata.\nASHLEY: Oh.\nASHLEY: Yay teamwork, teamwork.\nTRAVIS: Yay, you loosened it up for me.\nASHLEY: Yeah I did!\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nASHLEY: Best pals!","response":"DM: You guys, you take five or six minutes or so. You manage to hack away enough in one of the pillars to leave enough room to squeeze through. It takes a while. You manage to cleave that open. You all gather your things, you group together and you can continue in whichever direction you wish."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Down.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we're going down.\nLAURA: Stealth!\nLIAM: There are also some, I believe some duergar we didn't tell you–\nLAURA: Ahead of us.\nLIAM: Yes, while you were sleeping in the middle of the night, duergar walked– I assume–\nLAURA: Dooragar?\nLIAM: Duraga.\nLIAM: (in odd accent) Duergar, some duergar walked down the passageway while you were sleeping.\nTALIESIN: Doo-agar.\nORION: Duragar.\nASHLEY: Dooagar.\nLIAM: But we thought it best to lay low and they went on.\nMARISHA: That's good.\nLAURA: Yes.\nLIAM: So, steady as she goes.\nLAURA: They might be ahead of us.\nTALIESIN: We should probably be quiet.\nMARISHA: Before we leave, I wanna go ahead and take a minute to meditate. If you guys can, you know, just watch while I meditate.\nTALIESIN: Oh god.\nLAURA: And lend our energy to you.\nMARISHA: Yes, if you guys could lend your positive energy it would be very helpful.\nTRAVIS: (fart sounds)\nMARISHA: So I can Commune With Nature.\nTALIESIN: I'll be out of the hole.\nMARISHA: I want to do Commune (pronouncing incorrectly) With Nature.","response":"DM: Commune? (pronouncing correctly)"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes, or Commune, whatever.","response":"DM: You wanna start a commune in nature?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Commune.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I want to start a commune in nature.\nTALIESIN: Commune in a commune.\nORION: Can we do that? How high is that roll again?\nMARISHA: Commune in commune in a commune.\nLIAM: Going the homeopathic route, I like it.\nMARISHA: That one.","response":"DM: Okay, keeping the best essence–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh god.","response":"DM: – of the scenery around you, you take a moment. What's the reach of that one?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just read it, where is it?","response":"DM: Whatcha got?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Three miles.","response":"DM: Three miles. The natural entities that you can sense in this cavern system are the few clusters of bats that exist in the back portion of the war camp that you guys just ran from. That's about it, I mean, there are a few other strange things that you've seen that live down here, but they wouldn't be anything that you would naturally sense."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What more do you see?\nMARISHA: Lots of bats. They're very nice bats\nTRAVIS: Well, that's good.\nORION: I love bats.\nMARISHA: Very pleasant, they're very friendly. That's about it.\nORION: Very good.\nLAURA: Bats.\nMARISHA and TALIESIN: Bats.\nMARISHA: Okay, carry on, let's go.\nTRAVIS: Oh, good.\nMARISHA: Thank you for your positive energy.\nLAURA: Nice.\nTALIESIN: It's humid in here.","response":"DM: The smell is this combination of still water, groundwater type of a scent mixed with an ever-growing kind of sulfur-type, brimstone smell."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Smells like Grog.\nTRAVIS: I would like to trip Vax.\nLIAM: That was quick.\nTRAVIS: As he's walking.\nLIAM: I insult you and you trip me in a half a second? Would you like to take a shot at my nads as well?\nLAURA: You knew it was coming, as well.","response":"DM: Make an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes! 24!","response":"DM: Make an acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Suck it, elf.\nLIAM: What goes around comes around, baby. 22.\nMARISHA: Ooh.","response":"DM: (impact sound) Face down, Vax."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes!","response":"DM: A slight bruise on the cheek as you go faceplanting into the stonework ahead of you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: For god's sake.\nLIAM: I'm going to voluntarily erase one hit point.\nTRAVIS: What, what happened? What happened? Did you not stealth past that little pebble?\nTRAVIS: Yeah?\nLIAM: I may be there, I may not.\nASHLEY: Hey! Don't be rude to him!\nLAURA: You guys, you guys.\nTRAVIS: Oh, I'm so happy right now.\nLAURA: These caverns are getting to us.","response":"DM: Clarota shuffles alongside you guys."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right, everyone, we're getting slap-happy.\nTRAVIS: That's all I wanted.\nASHLEY: Lack of oxygen.\nLAURA: We're going crazy down here.\nMARISHA: Grog, it's only 9:30 in the morning.\nORION: I feel fine.\nMARISHA: For christ's sake.","response":"DM: As you guys are walking, you're welcome to make chatter, any discussions you'd like."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That was a high acrobatics roll. I think the DM wanted me to eat shit.","response":"DM: No, it was yours versus his."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: Oh, really? It was a direct contest?","response":"DM: It was a direct versus 24 versus 22. He won."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You still wanted me to eat shit.","response":"DM: No, it's up to the rolls, man."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So wait, we get a chance to chat for a second?\nORION: Yes.\nMARISHA: Pike, did you ever fully tell us what all you saw in your vision? I mean, have you perhaps had any more visions?\nLAURA: Visions? You had a vision?\nASHLEY: I did, I did.\nLAURA: What?\nASHLEY: So, when I stayed away, I went to a shrine of Sarenrae, just to sorta see, 'cause I had a feeling that I'd been here, or something like that. So in this vision, I basically saw what we've been going through already.\nMARISHA: What?\nASHLEY: And what the soldier was talking about. So I saw something that was– there was a single twisted horn of blackened soul matter.\nLAURA: Oh, soul matter?\nMARISHA: Soul matter?\nTALIESIN: Oh.\nLIAM: Sounds dirty.\nASHLEY: It was a point of concentrated evil.\nORION: Oh.\nLAURA: This horn?\nASHLEY: Yes.\nMARISHA: Concentrated evil.\nORION: Nasty horn.\nASHLEY: And it was so strong that I couldn't stay in the vision, because I could feel that it was taking over, so I pulled me out of the dream, among various things. But I saw–\nMARISHA: Like the horn of Sauron?\nASHLEY: The horn of Sauron, is what it said.\nORION: Is that your cousin?\nLIAM: Did you see any whales?\nLAURA: The horn of–\nASHLEY: I didn't see whales.\nLIAM: No whales.\nLAURA: Okay, no narwhals.\nMARISHA: No whales, no narwhals.\nLAURA: The horn of K'varn, yes?\nASHLEY: Yes.\nLAURA: Okay.\nMARISHA: Horn of evil.\nASHLEY: I some visions of where sort of– 'Cause I kind of went in past and then got to this thing. So I guess depending on where we are–\nLAURA: Can you lead in the direction to go?\nASHLEY: Yes, if I see things that are familiar. Such as–\nASHLEY: I went past a jagged onyx-colored fortress framed in molten rock.\nLIAM: Oh.\nLAURA: I think that probably–\nMARISHA: The place we're heading.\nLAURA: The place we're going to.\nASHLEY: Yes.\nLIAM: That sounds creepy\nASHLEY: Past a field of broken glass and bone.\nORION: Right.\nMARISHA: We haven't seen that. Oh no.\nTRAVIS: Obsidian, maybe?\nASHLEY: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: Or just melted sand.\nTRAVIS: I mean, whatever that is.\nASHLEY: And the prettiest was into a cavern of blue crystal, where a fungal fortress–\nLAURA: A fungal fortress?\nMARISHA: Ooh.\nASHLEY: – sort of entwined an ancient city of marble and jade–\nORION: Three different places.\nLIAM: That sounds really shitty.\nLAURA: Did the blue gemstones look valuable?\nMARISHA: It sounds amazing, that doesn't sound shitty.","response":"DM: As you start to mention that now, Clarota kind of nods and says,"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It feels a bit– broken glass.","response":"DM: “Aye, that's where the colony resides.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Your colony?","response":"DM: “Our great city.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: In which of those places? In the–\nLAURA: In the fungal city.\nLIAM: Fungal.","response":"DM: “Amongst the ruins of jade and glass.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispers) Jade.\nORION: Is that where we should go?\nMARISHA: That's Yug'Voril?","response":"DM: “Surrounded by the forest.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's Yug'Voril?","response":"DM: “The city below Yug'Voril, that is where the temple resides, where K'varn holds the Elder Brain.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ah.\nORION: Ah, this is where we need to go, I'm assuming.","response":"DM: “Ah, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He sounds like a real fun-guy.\nTRAVIS: Oh god.\n(all groan)\nTALIESIN: Trip him again, trip him again.\nMARISHA: Trip him again!\nLIAM: I'm a dad.\nLAURA: So I bet the fortress–","response":"DM: Make a will saving throw."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh my god.\nLIAM: What is that? Wisdom?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 12.","response":"DM: Okay, you feel a mental slap as Clarota glares at you from across the tunnel. “There'll be none of that in my presence.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You got bitch-slapped.","response":"DM: “I hate puns.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) I hate puns.\nLIAM: Noted, noted.\nLAURA: So I bet, first fortress you saw, I bet the one of obsidian was where–\nLIAM: Percy's losing his shit.\nORION: There's a bathroom right over there, Percy.\nLAURA: – where Lady Kima is being held.\nASHLEY: I think–\nLAURA: I bet that's the one, because he mentioned molten lava or something. So she's being held there and then further in is K'varn.\nASHLEY: Yeah.\nORION: So get there, get K'varn.","response":"DM: “Yes, Emberhold, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Emberhold, yes. Is that an obsidian fortress?","response":"DM: “It is black and jagged, I think, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, let's keep going that way.\nMARISHA: So the ultimate question is, are we heading the right way? Are we heading the right way, Pike, do you know?\nASHLEY: Can I perception check?","response":"DM: You guys are unfamiliar with this tunnel, Clarota is unfamiliar with this tunnel. All you know is it's going down. That's better than up."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I feel like that's the way we need to go.\nLAURA: So, just keep going, then?\nTALIESIN: Let's keep going.\nTRAVIS: Do I need to take off running again?\nLAURA: No.\nASHLEY: I think basically we need to go down, 'cause if we go up that means we're going out.\nLAURA: Yeah, let's keep going.\nTRAVIS: We can go–","response":"DM: You guys press forward and you begin to encounter little trickles on the ceiling of orange, glowing little puddles."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Avoid that!\nMARISHA: If we learned anything from Minecraft–\nLAURA: Don't touch that.","response":"DM: Progressing further down, you start seeing large clusters, little pools of molten rock beginning to form under certain sections. In a little ways up, you begin hearing some additional footsteps to your own. Further down the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh. Can we stealth, can we stealth? And my favored terrain is the Underdark.","response":"DM: It is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't know what that means, though.\nLAURA: No, no, no, I know. But I don't know what favored terrain gives me, because I tried to look it up and couldn't find it.\nASHLEY: You just love it.\nLAURA: Does it give me an advantage?","response":"DM: Here, there's a sheet that has all the information you need."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh good, thank you.\nORION: By the way, I take one of the earrings from Scanlan and give it to Grog. So Grog, now you've got one of the–\nTRAVIS: I've got an earring?","response":"DM: Scanlan is not happy about this."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well? He's not saying anything.\nLIAM: Everyone, there's footsteps coming from ahead. Let Vex'ahlia and I scout ahead. Wait for a moment.\nLAURA: Yes, okay. Let's go.","response":"DM: Stealth checks, both of you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, finally.\nLIAM: 22 for me.\nLAURA: The same for me, actually. Twinsies. Sorry.\nTRAVIS: Ah, let me play. Please.\nLIAM: Well it's definitely not duergar. How far ahead of us do they sound?\nLAURA: Can we see it?","response":"DM: Probably a good 60, 70 feet. You hear some muttering."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I understand what they're saying?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm listening, trying to make out how many sets of footsteps I can hear.\nLAURA: And I look on the ground and see if I can find multiple sets of footsteps as well.","response":"DM: Looking on the ground, you guys have no light source currently. It's pitch black."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But there's lava spilling and we can see in dim light.\nTRAVIS: Shit.\nLIAM: Cart. Could be some sort of device–","response":"DM: From around the edge, you can just barely make out these two lumbering humanoid shapes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Can we tell what they are?\nLAURA: Oh, he's trying to see if they're seeing us.\nLIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: They begin to step towards your direction."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We back away.","response":"DM: You guys back and kind of flatten yourself against the wall."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Separate sides.","response":"DM: You can see they're now both dragging behind them this small roughshod cart, with something inside it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We string a rope across the tunnel.","response":"DM: Okay, you pull it across."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, yeah!\nLIAM: I also yank my serpentine belt off–\nLAURA: Oh!\nLIAM: And throw it out, right under the rope.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What does that do?\nLIAM: Snake.","response":"DM: So, as he throws the leather, the leather shifts form suddenly in midair into a serpent that slips onto the ground, and slithers in place, curling up at the approaching two monolithic entities."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That is stupid.\nLIAM: Yes, it is.\nLAURA: This is gonna go really poorly.","response":"DM: As they begin to cross in front of you, you both pull taut on the rope."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is dumb.","response":"DM: The immediate one falls forward, tripping face-first on the ground, a heavy (impact sound). You guys hear in the distance this loud thud, impact sound."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And we call, I go, Grog!\nTRAVIS: I'm raging.\nLIAM: And I leap out, daggers at the fallen one.\nMARISHA: Run!","response":"DM: You guys come rushing in, let's go ahead and roll initiative."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah!\nTRAVIS: I raged.","response":"DM: I figured you were raging."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well, you know, when the ladies call my name.\nTALIESIN: That sucks.\nMARISHA: That's not too bad, could be worse.\nORION: Yes, sounds good.\nMARISHA: What are we fighting? What are we fighting?\nLAURA: I know, right? Oh god, here we go.\nMARISHA: What are we fighting, we don't know.\nLAURA: Oh! Lava pools.\nTALIESIN: Lava pools.\nMARISHA: Lava pools, Lava pools.\nTRAVIS: Wow.\nASHLEY: Wow.\nMARISHA: Grog, you better be throwing bitches into that lava.\nTRAVIS: Last time I tried to do somebody to something, I did it to myself, so.\nLIAM: Hashtag bitches in lava?\nMARISHA: Hashtag bitches in lava!","response":"DM: You guys, coming in this way."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Bitches in lava, bitches in lava.\nASHLEY and LAURA: Oh god!\nORION: She's excited about the lava.\nLIAM: I got 99 problems and a troll ain't one.\nLAURA: Are they trolls, are they ogres?","response":"DM: They are two giant ogres."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, god, one's on the ground.\nTRAVIS: Oh, shit.\nLAURA: It's huge, these are really big.","response":"DM: One is back here and one's just fallen over there."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Holy cow.","response":"DM: And they are carrying some sort of large cart-like object, I'll just say for now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is so dumb, why did we do this?\nTALIESIN: This is a d20.\nTRAVIS: What's in the cart?","response":"DM: So, initiative order, guys?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do we get the surprise at all?","response":"DM: You do, actually! I'm rolling initiative, so we have the order. You guys are gonna have a full round of surprise on them first."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, cool.\nLAURA: Oh, man, really?","response":"DM: 20 to 15?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 19.\nLAURA: 15.\nLIAM: 15.\nORION: I got scared and I cast Stoneskin immediately.\nASHLEY: Cast what?\nORION: Stoneskin.","response":"DM: So Vex and Vax, both at 15?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: 15, yeah.\nLIAM and LAURA: Oh!","response":"DM: 15 to ten?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 13.\nMARISHA: 13 as well.\nASHLEY: 11.\nLAURA: Oh no, Grog, what did you roll?\nTRAVIS: I farted when I rolled, I rolled a nine.","response":"DM: Oh! Grog."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Greg.\nORION: How much does the ogre weigh? Or the ogres, as you said?","response":"DM: The ogres, each one weighs nearly a ton."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, shit, really?\nLAURA: Oh, they're huge.\nTRAVIS: So, like, 200 pounds.\nMATT and LIAM: Yes.\nLIAM: Yes, exactly.","response":"DM: Yes, Grog, close to that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, Grog.\nLAURA: Awesome.\nLIAM: I'm already jumping in the air, so I'm gonna go.","response":"DM: To the guy on the ground."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, and this, since it's a surprise, it's automatic crit?","response":"DM: Yes!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, nice.\nMARISHA: Hell, yeah!","response":"DM: He's on the ground, so you get advantage on your attack rolls."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, 1d4 for– this is my poison dagger. Two, eight, okay, I'm doing my Sneak Attack damage, here we go, four, nine, 12, 18, yeah, 23. Total for that, 62 points of damage.","response":"DM: 62 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wow.","response":"DM: You leap on and entirely eviscerate the ogre. You jumped onto his back, slashing the back of his torso. As you pull open the flesh, you expose the back of the ribcage, and he goes into this kind of gurgling sound as it dies immediately on the spot."}
{"prompt":"LAURA, MARISHA and ASHLEY: Oh, what?\nLIAM: And I use my bonus action to hide.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you wanna talk to the other one, since–\nLAURA: 62.","response":"DM: Okay, roll and make a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Natural 20.\nORION: Nice.\nLIAM: See you later, motherfuckers.","response":"DM: The ogre is right there. There is the ogre on the ground, big squishy ogre."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What?\nTRAVIS: Big squishy ogre.\nLAURA: I Hunter's Mark him, and I'm gonna shoot him with the explosive arrow.\nTALIESIN: Yeah!\nTRAVIS: I like it.\nLAURA: So I'm gonna see if it hits. I'm gonna use the blazing bowstring. That's a 22.","response":"DM: 22 definitely hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Also, blazing bowstring that gives me a plus d10. So, okay, 14 plus d10, wait, that's a ten? Yeah!\nLIAM: That's a ten.\nLAURA: Plus 19 and then Hunter's Mark! Plus six!\nLIAM: Ah yes!","response":"DM: 25."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 25, plus whatever the explosive damage is.","response":"DM: So! As you pull the arrow out, it's a little wonky, it's actually, what you rolled, it's a minus four penalty to hit with it, but you still manage to hit because it's a big creature, even though it's in very big darkness, you– you know, in darkness you ignore partial cover."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right!\nLIAM: Bellybutton.","response":"DM: You fire it. It arcs slightly, smacks in the side of its chest and stomach area. It's this cacophonous explosion sound that rocks the immediate vicinity."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Whoa! Yes!\nTRAVIS: Yes!","response":"DM: It takes an additional 2d8 points of explosive damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ooh!\nTALIESIN: Yeah!\nORION: Nice.","response":"DM: Nine points, and everything around it also takes the additional damage–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh shit!","response":"DM: – the whole radius does."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I hope I didn't blow up the cart.","response":"DM: The cart– the wood on the wheels had shatters and breaks, it falls to one side. What you see, some sort of a glass container that was at the back of the cart shatters and cracks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) Oh no.\nMARISHA: Oh.\nTALIESIN: I'm still happy.\nLAURA: Welp?\nLIAM: Still pretty cool, still pretty cool.\nMARISHA: Collateral damage. It's bound to happen.","response":"DM: Top of the round. Tiberius."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, and can I move away?","response":"DM: You can move if you want. Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, I move back.","response":"DM: Back to here?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah. Sounds good.\nTRAVIS: Where's your pointer?","response":"DM: Use your pointer if you need it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh right! Well, there.\nORION: Very good! I'll take a few steps forward and be like, well, this is poppycock! And I'll shoot a Scorching Ray right at the dude.\nLAURA: Does anybody speak Ogre? Nobody speaks Ogre, though. We can't talk to him.\nTRAVIS: No.\nLIAM: They're dumber than Grog is.\nORION: So what am I rolling?","response":"DM: Do you ignore partial cover?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! Like can I just in general?","response":"DM: I mean, did you take that feat?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No.","response":"DM: No. Okay. So yeah. So you're rolling– okay, so yeah. So what did you roll to hit?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I rolled all three at once. 'Cause I have to do one for each.","response":"DM: Right, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So I got a 12, a 13, and a 12.","response":"DM: Okay. All three rays unfortunately miss–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Damn it!","response":"DM: – due to the darkness in this room it's very hard to see, other than the slight glow from the lava. So you fire all three rays, and you see them streak through, and each one gives off just enough light from the actual flaming ray to glow to the vicinity, but not the actual target. You see them both streak off and slam the wall on the opposite side."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wait, do I add my dex on those?","response":"DM: You add your spell modifier."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (whispers) What's my spell modifier?","response":"DM: It's on top of your spell page!"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! Oh, no, I'm sorry, 20– plus nine on all that.","response":"DM: Good to know."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, sorry.","response":"DM: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay.","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, first one does five–","response":"DM: It's his first time casting spells, guys."}
{"prompt":"(mouths) It's not.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nORION: – plus five, ten! I rarely do this one, kids.\nLIAM: It's part of his charm.\nORION: Ten on the first one.\nORION: 17 on the second one. And 17 on the second one.\nLAURA: He's so dead!","response":"DM: Okay, is there a saving throw for half damage?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No! I mean, 12 on the third one.","response":"DM: Is there a saving throw on this one, or is it just straight damage?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, straight damage.\nORION: Yes!\nORION: Yeah!","response":"DM: Still standing. Barely. It's now its turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)","response":"DM: It steps away."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (whispers) You can't see me.\nLAURA: Over the dead body of his brethren.","response":"DM: To that point. It's just going to charge through, as all it can see is the figures in the distance."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Pick me.","response":"DM: That's where it is. At which point, the cart seems to shift slightly."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh shit.\nLAURA: Oh no, what did we do?\nLIAM: Oh dear, something's coming out of the jar.\nMARISHA: What did we open?\nLAURA: Oh, god. We let something out.","response":"DM: You can see something slowly– dark something–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I thought it was going to be a good thing!","response":"DM: – amorphous and liquid in nature beginning to shift in the shadow."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, great.\nLAURA: Does it– Oh no– Is it on fire so we can see–\nLIAM: No.\nLAURA: – is it on fire so we can see what it is?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No.\nTALIESIN: Oh my god!\nLAURA: The cart wasn't on fire?\nLIAM: It's dangerous! It's dangerous! It's fucking dangerous!","response":"DM: It's just this giant, black, liquid–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What is that?","response":"DM: – ooze-like creature."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's black ooze. It's dangerous!\nMARISHA: We just opened Pandora's box.\nLAURA: This is really, really bad!\nLIAM: It's fucking dangerous.\nLAURA: I'm sorry I exploded it.\nMARISHA: Great. That's good. Good.\nLIAM: Stay away from it. Stay away from it. Stay away from it.\nTRAVIS: So go wrestle it?\nASHLEY: So go jump in it, is what you're saying.\nLIAM: French kiss that shit!\nTRAVIS: It's mine!\nLAURA: (whispers) Don't attack it.\nTRAVIS: Don't attack it?\nLAURA: I'm scared of it.\nMARISHA: Black ooze.\nLIAM: Ranged attacks.\nLAURA: What does a black ooze do?\nLIAM: Fire and ranged attacks.\nMARISHA: How do I handle that?","response":"DM: So! That brings us to–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Fire?\nLIAM: Think!","response":"DM: Scanlan. Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no, oh god, Scanlan.","response":"DM: I know you're out there, Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do something amazing, Scanlan!\nLIAM: Sing, Sam! Sing!","response":"DM: Scanlan's going to go ahead and sing a song of inspiration to– I'd say Grog just in case he needs to-"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (sings) When we have to fight the ooze, you'll never have to lose.\nTRAVIS: What?\nLAURA: You received an inspiration.\nTRAVIS: Oh good, yeah, thank you. It's an eight, right?","response":"DM: Yeah, it's a d8 inspiration dice."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I want some food. I'm so hungry.\nLIAM: (sings) We're up all night in the dark, we're up all night in the dark.\nTALIESIN and MARISHA: (sing) We're up all night in the dark.\nORION: Is that what Sam would do?","response":"DM: Scanlan is then going to cast Invisibility on himself as an immediate self-sustaining reaction."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Me?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ranged attack, ranged attack.\nLAURA: Okay, on the thingie?\nMARISHA: Pew pew.\nORION: Take out the ogre first.\nLAURA: Okay. Well I'm gonna Lightning Bolt the black ooze!","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sounds good.\nLAURA: Okay. Which–","response":"DM: So you Lightning Arrow."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, I do. Okay. Oh, and, oh, the other– never mind, that other guy's still Hunter's Marked. Okay.\nMARISHA: Well, yeah.\nLIAM: Hit it, hit it, hit it.\nLAURA: Okay, that's good.\nLIAM: Yes, it is!\nLAURA: That's a 19 plus– that's a regular attack bonus, right?\nLIAM: It's a crit.\nLAURA: Was it?\nLIAM: Isn't 19-20 crit? That's just for me.","response":"DM: No, that's just for you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's just for you, yo.","response":"DM: Yeah, so that hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. So.\nMARISHA: What if it's like a sentient alien lifeform?\nLAURA: Okay, 4d8 of lightning damage.\nMARISHA: You know, like some Spiderman shit.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll the arrow damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Some alien lifeform shit.\nTALIESIN: Well, we should kill it.\nLAURA: Oh, okay.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nLAURA: Just kidding, I'm just so excited! 11.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. And the 4d8 of lightning damage.","response":"DM: As the arrow disappears into its form–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No.","response":"DM: – the bolt of energy, as you pull out the arrow and release it, it sparks and you can see the blue energy kind of streaking behind the arrow. It plunges into this thick, black, gooey mass and as it does, the lightning just gets absorbed into its form."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, shit balls.","response":"DM: It sits for a second, shakes and quivers, and then splits."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh! No.\nLAURA: Splits?\nLIAM: Yeah, it splits into smaller ones. Smaller sizes.","response":"DM: Dividing into two separate smaller slimes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No!\nLAURA: What is this thing?","response":"DM: Seemingly unaffected by the damage of the lightning. Other than the fact that you altered its form slightly."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Great. Cool. Awesome.","response":"DM: So, do you wish to move?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, yeah! I back the eff up. Actually, should– yeah, yeah. I'm gonna back up. To there sounds good.\nORION and ASHLEY: The ol' reach-around.\nLIAM: And I'm hidden– I'm stealth already, I think, right?\nORION: Courteous!","response":"DM: You are, yes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's like his character move.\nTALIESIN: The stealthy reach-around.\nTRAVIS: Action figure Vax'ahlia.\nLIAM: So the first attack is an 18.\nTALIESIN: The stealthy reach-around.\nLAURA: That's Vax'ildan.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Sorry. Vax'ildan.\nLIAM: Okay, Sneak Attack, here we go.\nTRAVIS: The signature reach-around move!\nLIAM: For the eyeballs. Two plus seven is–\nLAURA: I'm sorry I let the ooze loose.\nTALIESIN: It's okay.\nLIAM: 40. 52.","response":"DM: 52. As you reach behind, the daggers plunge into it, and the ogre lumbering over doesn't have any more to its life. Its jaw just goes slack as it releases the last bit of air in its lungs, tumbling forward, piling onto his friend."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: As it does, I want to use my bonus action to spring off his shoulders towards my friends.","response":"DM: Okay. Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's good.\nLIAM: Sure.\nLAURA: Over the lava pit.\nTRAVIS: Kill it.\nLAURA: Don't fall in the lava pit.\nLIAM: That's a 15.","response":"DM: 15, okay. You barely manage to catch your footing. Thank god you didn't roll a one. That would've been very bad. This ogre then plummets to the ground, now piling on top of his friend."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, that's good.\nTALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try something weird, here.\nTRAVIS: Oh no.\nTALIESIN: Where am I? Okay. I'm going to step forward and to the right a bit. Just sort of joining this little– like getting right in here. And I'm going to try and shoot, and this is gonna sound weird, but as I'm running I'm going to– Actually, back me up to about there.","response":"DM: There?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to try and shoot about right here, I'm gonna try and unleash the lava to send the lava– to see if I can get it to start flowing towards. Does that make sense?","response":"DM: I will tell you, the pool of lava right there isn't brimming really close to the surface."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, it's just down?","response":"DM: It would take a significant impact to carve anything that would release it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, well–","response":"DM: It's self-contained."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: – I've come forward enough, I'm gonna take a shot at one of these guys, then.","response":"DM: Okay. This one, or this one?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That one.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and roll for attack–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm gonna try something else. I'm gonna try an ice shot.","response":"DM: Ice shot. Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 15?","response":"DM: 15?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (sneezes dramatically)\nLAURA: Bless you.","response":"DM: 15 hits!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 15 hits.\nLAURA: 15 hits.\nTRAVIS: Let's just take it.\nLAURA: Well, what else are we gonna do with it?\nTALIESIN: – that's 15 points of damage, plus six points of ice damage.","response":"DM: Okay. The bullet pierces his form. You can see a part of its gelatinous, physical structure quiver. The ice explosion, you see go off, and just get absorbed into the gelatinous form."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fuck.\nTALIESIN: Fuck!","response":"DM: Seemingly unaffected by the additional damage. That's your first shot. You get two shots, don't you?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's right. Oh, good god.\nMARISHA: But it didn't split, right?\nMATT and ORION: Nope.\nMARISHA: That's cool. It's a perk.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, no, that's– Okay. I'm going to attempt to– Is there any loose-looking rocks that are up above? Or is there anything that looks like, if I gave it a push, would fall down, from up above?","response":"DM: This tunnel looks pretty, at this point, pretty cleanly carved out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What about the areas I exploded?","response":"DM: Over there? I mean, there's parts of the rock, but the explosion was more damaging to things that were fragile–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, okay.","response":"DM: – the stonework is pretty solid."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm gonna take another shot at the same one and see what happens.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 20, that hits.","response":"DM: Yep! Damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Not a lot. That's seven points of damage.","response":"DM: Okay. Gotcha. Both shots into it. You see its form kind of quiver at the impact, but it's still slowly slithering forward. Now comes to Keyleth!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. I wanna move, kind of be like, whoops, sorry, 'scuse me, pardon me, and come like heresies. Would you say that I'm 30 feet away from that guy?","response":"DM: Just barely. Like, he's just in the cusp of 30 feet from you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Will my Thorn Whip reach him? My 30-foot-range Thorn Whip?","response":"DM: You can certainly try!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm gonna try and Thorn Whip him!","response":"DM: Okay!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (Cosby voice) You see, the black goo thing–","response":"DM: What's the Thorn Whip do?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: – is not so easy to kill.\nMARISHA: Huh?","response":"DM: What's the Thorn Whip do? Read the spell for me."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Too soon?\nLAURA: Too soon?\nMARISHA: Well, it does 2d6 damage, it's a 30-foot range, and it pulls 10 feet. Notes I have on it– Okay– piercing damage– if they are large or smaller, you pull the creature up to ten feet closer.","response":"DM: What type of damage is it?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Piercing.\nMARISHA: I hit. I don't hit. That's funny. Okay.","response":"DM: You rolled a 20, right?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I didn't roll yet.","response":"DM: Oh, you didn't roll yet. Sorry."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and roll to hit."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What do I add, my spell modifier?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 18.","response":"DM: Yeah, you hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Woo!\nASHLEY: Woo!","response":"DM: So, go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 19, sorry, it's actually 19.","response":"DM: That still hits! It doesn't move very fast, it's a little easy to hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, that's good.\nMARISHA: One piercing damage, but I pull him ten feet closer to me. Does he go into the lava?","response":"DM: Gets pushed just ever so slightly into the hole. As it does, you can see this blackish steam and smoke begin to billow up from where it hits, and it (growls)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good!","response":"DM: – begins to quiver as you're kind of yanking it back with the Thorn Whip."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What was that sound it made again?","response":"DM: (growls)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Woo!","response":"DM: – from the impact of the lava. That's an additional 17 points of fire damage to it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's nice.\nLIAM: Yes!\nLAURA: Fire damage!\nASHLEY: Nice!\nLIAM: Aw, yes!\nLAURA: Kill it with fire!\nMARISHA: And I've got him on a leash now.\nLIAM: Burn it!","response":"DM: You do. Is it considered grappled?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Nope.","response":"DM: Then that would be the end of the attack. The spell dissipates after that."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, okay.","response":"DM: You've gotta do it again the next turn."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nLIAM: Hey, that was pretty good.\nLAURA: Yep.\nASHLEY: Okay. So, question. I want to use something I think that I can use called– this may be stupid, so I have another option if this is dumb.\nTRAVIS: That's what it's called?\nASHLEY: Yes.\nORION: That's a weird spell!\nLIAM: So long!\nASHLEY: Something called 'Insect Plague'.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ooh, yeah!\nASHLEY: Which you can use as a ranged attack in a 20-foot-radius sphere?","response":"DM: Yes. So, you do it at range, and it creates a 20-foot radius that does this."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, and then it's a 1d10– creature takes 4d10 piercing damage– oh, on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nLAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: Cool! So there's that, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Very Old Testament!\nASHLEY: So, I think–","response":"DM: Do you wanna move–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, do it!\nASHLEY: Okay, you know, let's give it a try!\nLAURA: And then we can see what it does to creatures within its zone!","response":"DM: Where do you wanna go, girl?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so, where am I? I'm sorry, I can't see.","response":"DM: You're right over here. It's your gold base."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So, where do I need to be to do it– like over here?\nLIAM: Get closer.\nLAURA: Maybe up next to the ogre dead.\nLIAM: Gotta run up.","response":"DM: Okay. One, two, three, four. That's about as close as you can get there, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. So can I still get it there?","response":"DM: Yeah, you can cast it. Where do you want to put the radius?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Are these all five?\nORION: Yeah.","response":"DM: These are all five-foot squares."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so can I–\nLIAM: I'd just like to point out, this is like the Avengers trailer, where all the heroes run out and jump at the same time.\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Yeah. Yeah, you can get these both from there."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll try to get them both.\nASHLEY: So then ten.","response":"DM: So you go ahead and roll the damage."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so how– Wait, how many do I roll, again? At fifth level?","response":"DM: You're casting this as a fifth-level spell?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Well, maybe I shouldn't–","response":"DM: It's up to you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, do it.\nASHLEY: Okay, I'll do it.\nLIAM: Do it, do it, try it.\nASHLEY: But do I save a healing?\nLIAM: Do it.\nLAURA: Go for it, Pike.\nLIAM: Come on, you're a warrior.","response":"DM: It's up to you, Pike. You do what you gotta do."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so– Cool, one.\nLAURA: Ten.\nLIAM: Ten.\nASHLEY: Ten, 11.\nLAURA: 18.\nASHLEY: 19.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So how many do I roll? That was three–","response":"DM: It gets to make a saving throw to see if it gets half damage."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So I roll another one then–\nLAURA: Yeah, four. She gets four.","response":"DM: What's–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I roll, I roll four. Hold on. 19.\nLAURA: 25.\nLIAM: 25.\nASHLEY: 25.","response":"DM: Okay, what's the DC? What's your spell DC at the top of your spell sheet?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Eight plus– Or– No, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.","response":"DM: DC should be–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 16.\nLIAM: That's better.","response":"DM: 16, okay, one makes its save, the other doesn't."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: So what's the total damage?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 25.\nASHLEY: 25.","response":"DM: Okay, so one takes 25, one takes 13."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Cool.\nTALIESIN: Wow.","response":"DM: Piercing damage. Got it. And, just, insects appear in the area, doing that much damage. Does that stay? Or does that go away at the end of your turn?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Let's see here.","response":"DM: What's the duration?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Concentration. Up to ten minutes.","response":"DM: So you can keep it there if you want to."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh.\nASHLEY: I'll just keep it.","response":"DM: It just does damage every turn to everything in that radius."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Awesome, let's just keep it.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm just really concentrating.","response":"DM: That ends your turn. Grog, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right, I would like to pull the flaming hammer out of the bag of holding.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: And I would like to run at the– this little– this guy.\nORION: No, you'll get in the insect cloud.\nTRAVIS: What?\nORION: You'll get in the insect cloud.\nLAURA: Stay away from the insect cloud.\nTRAVIS: I forgot there was an insect cloud.","response":"DM: Five, six, seven, eight. That's as far as you can get, currently."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, because there are bodies in the way?","response":"DM: Because of the rough terrain, and you have to jump over the bodies to get there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait, but my natural ability–\nTRAVIS: Then if that's as far as I can get, I would like to take the hooded lantern I have out of the bag of holding and throw it–\nLAURA: Difficult terrain does not slow my group's travel when this is my favored terrain.\nMARISHA: Ooh!\nTRAVIS: Yes!","response":"DM: Nice one. Boom, boom, boom. So you just go charging up overtop the ogre bodies, leaping, coming down with the– hammer, you said?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes, with the flaming hammer.\nLIAM: Oh man, you the real MVP.\nTRAVIS: – activating the flaming properties of rage, and urine, and death.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Flame on.\nORION: Rage, urine, and death.\nLIAM: Wow.\nLAURA: Don't get touched by it. Don't let it touch you.\nTRAVIS: We'll see.\nASHLEY: Don't let it touch you.\nLIAM: Work those rules.","response":"DM: Go for it. So go ahead and roll for attack. You have three attacks with this, at–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Rage, urine, and death.","response":"DM: Are you frenzying or regular rage?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Raging, raging, rage. Just regular rage.","response":"DM: Okay, so you get two attacks."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah. 19.","response":"DM: 19 hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And 12.","response":"DM: 12 also hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Awesome. And this is a 1d–","response":"DM: And damage, are you using it two-handed?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: 1d10 damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 1d10.","response":"DM: Plus whatever the fire damage is on the weapon."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That can't be right.","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What? What the dice rolled?\nTRAVIS: 1d10? Is this the right dice?\nTALIESIN: If you rolled zero, you rolled a ten.\nLAURA: If it's a zero, it's a ten.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: It's a 30.\nLAURA: Oh, that's a three. He rolled the–","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I was like, 30!","response":"DM: So, three plus your proficiency modifier, which is four."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah. Seven.","response":"DM: No, this is for damage, so the damage would be plus your strength modifier."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, four.","response":"DM: Yeah, so four still. So seven."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And plus seven for rage.","response":"DM: Plus two for rage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Plus two for rage.","response":"DM: Yeah, so whatever the bonus is to your greataxe–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: What's that?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, it's– to the greataxe is seven when I'm raging.","response":"DM: So then ten points of damage, then roll the fire damage as well."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay.\nLIAM: How is he keeping all of this in his mind? It's like a computer in his brain.\nLAURA: I know.\nTRAVIS: Is that a 1d10 also? 1d10?","response":"DM: It should say on the actual magical item."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yep, yep. 1d6.","response":"DM: So 1d6 additional fire damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Five.\nTRAVIS: Oh, Jesus. Seven.","response":"DM: So 14, plus an additional 1d6."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Grog, math hard.\nTRAVIS: Three.\nLAURA: Yeah!","response":"DM: You guys see this, like, red arc, as Grog comes slamming down into the ooze."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Fire hammer!","response":"DM: First one, it hits, boom, smacks, the flames ignite, and the impact, you see it kind of freaks out and quivers backwards, screeching sound. As it does, there's a splash of the black ichor that hits your shoulders–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) No!","response":"DM: – and you feel it burn and bite into your torso. You take ten points of acid damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, shit.\nLAURA: Acid.\nASHLEY: Acid.","response":"DM: You reach back, not even thinking in the frenzy in your brain, you feel like, just seeing blood and red in your eyes, as you slam down your second strike."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Grog is gonna start tripping.","response":"DM: You feel the second impact. Once again, you feel the spray of black across your body. You take an additional ten points of acid damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Up close sucks.\nLIAM: That's nothing for Grog, that's nothing.\nASHLEY: Nothing, nothing.\nMARISHA: Nothing, he likes it, feels good.\nTRAVIS: I'm pretty low.","response":"DM: That ends Grog's turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You're low? On health? Have you not healed at all?\nLIAM: No, we stayed up and kept watch.\nMARISHA: Just helped with that itch you couldn't scratch.\nLAURA: Jeez Louise.\nTRAVIS: No, I'm fine.","response":"DM: On this turn, this one pulls out of the lava–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No.","response":"DM: Takes an additional 2d10 from being in at the start of its turn. An additional eight damage, and moves up, both of them flank over to Grog."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Come to me, woodland creatures.","response":"DM: Both of them attempting to strike you from each side. As you're flanked, that is a 20 versus armor class."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That will hit.","response":"DM: And a 21 versus armor class."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That'll hit, too.\nMARISHA: You're being attacked by jello.\nTRAVIS: You broke in their glass casket.","response":"DM: One hits you for 12 points of damage–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.\nTRAVIS: Okay.","response":"DM: The other hits you for 14 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay.","response":"DM: Remember, you're raging, so that's halved."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, halved. Both of those?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Awesome.\nLIAM: Tank.\nASHLEY: He still has more than me.","response":"DM: However, both impacts slamming into your body, the leftover sludge begins to eat away and corrode the flesh upon impact. You take from both sides– non-halved, because it is not slashing, bludgeoning, or piercing damage– you take a total of 56 points of acid damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What?\nASHLEY: What?\nLAURA: What?","response":"DM: From both slams."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's gross.\nLAURA: (gasps) Grog's unconscious.\nTRAVIS: No, I'm not.\nLAURA: You're not?\nLIAM: Double that? Double that, or that?","response":"DM: No, from both sides. 28 from each."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: How many have you got?\nTRAVIS: 14.\nLAURA: Oh my god.\nTRAVIS: Okay, so little piles of shit have got huevos.\nASHLEY: Wait, and I can't–","response":"DM: Clarota moves from here, up to here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Clarota, save us!\nMARISHA: Really bad jello. It's, like, fridge experiment jello.\nTALIESIN: Coffee jello.\nMARISHA: Coffee jello?\nASHLEY: Grog!\nTRAVIS: That's me, all smart with the fire hammer.","response":"DM: Hey, it did damage, didn't it?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It certainly did something.","response":"DM: It certainly did something Clarota is going to move forward and is going to attempt a– It's kind of close– He is going to attempt a Lightning Bolt against this guy here."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No.\nLAURA: Don't do a Lightning Bolt! What? Why would Clarota use a Lightning Bolt when he saw that the lightning did not work for me?","response":"DM: Clarota did not see."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh.\nMARISHA: Clarota didn't see? Where was Clarota?","response":"DM: Way back here."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He has to look. He was hanging back.\nLAURA: Clarota is trying to screw with us.\nMARISHA: Why was he trailing? What the fuck?\nLIAM: Nah, he was hanging back.\nMARISHA: He's a slacker.\nLIAM: He's weak.\nMARISHA: He's a fucking slacker.\nORION: That's right, he's weak.\nLIAM: He's got this, but he doesn't have this. He's weak, he's hanging back.\nLIAM: What is the deal with the mind flayer?","response":"DM: I would recommend not arguing with the DM."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Right.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, right.\nMARISHA: I'm not arguing with the DM, I'm calling Clarota a slacker.","response":"DM: Clarota, as it released the bolt of energy, it streaks past, through the air. It arcs into the side of the entity, which then absorbs it. Clarota's eyes go wide for a second. Nervous, it looks at its hands, and puts them back underneath its robe. As it does–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fudge!\nMARISHA: Damn it, Clarota.","response":"DM: The entity divides once again."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: God! Darn it.","response":"DM: Into two more–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What is that?\nTRAVIS: Oh, shit.\nLAURA: What is happening?\nTRAVIS: Balls.\nTALIESIN: Oh, god.","response":"DM: That ends its turn. At this point in time, now the loud ruckus has been glaring through this tunnel–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Shit.","response":"DM: You hear (clicking sound)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Shit.\nTRAVIS: Ah, not an umber hulk.\nLAURA: Is it another one of those–","response":"DM: A pair of clacking sounds. And you, as soon as you look up at the ceiling and you see two large creatures clinging to the ceiling, scurrying across with these strange hooked hands, before both immediately leap down from the ceiling."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We're in big trouble.\nTALIESIN: Jesus Christ.\nLIAM: Oh, man.\nLAURA: Are you freaking kidding me?\nMARISHA: What are those? What is that?\nLAURA: He's trying to kill us.\nORION: Oh.\nLAURA: What is this?","response":"DM: These two large, armored, beak-faced subterranean creatures with shells on their backs and giant hooked arms leap down from the ceiling."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're gonna die.","response":"DM: One is going to attempt to strike with both of its hook attacks at Pike."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Pike isn't here!","response":"DM: This is one is moving over Tiberius."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, Tiberius, our soft, vulnerable spot.\nORION: What are you talking about?","response":"DM: So, against Pike, that is 21."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hits.\nTRAVIS: Hits.","response":"DM: And 13."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Misses.\nLAURA: Misses.\nLAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: Wherever she is. And the other one misses, clanging against the armor. The hook scrapes across metal, leaving this extremely loud sound. The other one goes twice against Tiberius. That is a 16."}
{"prompt":"ORION: A 17.","response":"DM: And a nine. Both miss. Barely getting out of the way. This giant, large, armored creature."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Falling from the ceiling.\nORION: Oh, I look at him with a funky grin.\nORION: It's a funky one. How much does he weigh? 800 pounds?","response":"DM: Pretty heavy. Say probably close to 500-600 pounds."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ah, beautiful. I cast Telekinesis and I hurl him over my head and chuck him at the other one. I want to get him away from Pike. I don't think I can throw him that far. How far away is he from the lava, actually?","response":"DM: It's about right there. It's about 35 feet."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm okay. I have a lot of armor.\nLAURA: She's good.\nORION: Then I'll try that instead. I'll try to slam dunk.","response":"DM: He makes a saving throw. That fails entirely. So the creature in front of you lifts up in the air, and starts flailing about with its hooks, trying to find some purchase in the ceiling. You toss it over, and it lands squarely into the pool of lava in the center of the tunnel. You hear screeching in pain as it begins trying to find his way out. Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes! Yes!\nMARISHA: I like lava pools. I like lava pools.\nTRAVIS: He starts sinking into the pool of lava?\nASHLEY: Whoa.","response":"DM: Tiberius just Telekinesis-ed him up in the air, and threw it into the lava pool."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes.\nLAURA: Good job.\nORION: I use two sorcerer points, and with the other one I do Glacial Blast at the other guy.","response":"DM: The other one there? Okay. Go ahead and roll– Add your–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Damn, Tiberius is getting really freaking cool. Badass.\nORION: Spell attack, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 13 plus two. 15.","response":"DM: 15? Right now, because of the level of darkness in the room, and because of its distance from you– You just managed to fire, just out of the range of the creature. It hits the wall behind him, leaving the slick of ice across the stone wall behind it, but unfortunately not the actual creature."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay. Okay. Oh! Right behind it? Do I see myself missing too? Fine. As I'm missing I'll form it into a spike at the end where the walls hit.","response":"DM: Okay!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah!\nLAURA: Ooh. Nice!\nORION: I'm going to– where's the– that way.","response":"DM: This way."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Out the hell– with the stuff– yes.","response":"DM: Now it would be the ogres, but they're all dead."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, come on, Scanlan!","response":"DM: Sees Pike in great danger. Sings a quick little ditty to go ahead and give an inspiration dice to Pike. So you get a d8."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: To help you with any sort of attack rolls, any saving throws, ability checks."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: How about for healing? Does it help with healing? Can I add it to anything?","response":"DM: Just attack rolls, saving throws, and checks."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: Scanlan is going to attempt to dominate the monster using his Dominate Creature spell. Saving throw. It does not make it. The creature that was harrowing Pike suddenly drops its claws for a second, turns away from you, and starts looking back towards the oozes and Grog. That brings us to Vex. You're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Do I have line-of-sight on the other ooze that's attacking Grog? The big one?","response":"DM: The big one over here? You do. It's dark, and you have no light source currently, so you can try a shot, but it's going to be at disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, then I guess I should just–\nLIAM: Half-elves see in dim light up to 60 feet. Does that pool of lava give anything?","response":"DM: It gives a very dull glow to the room. It's enough where you can see there is something there. You can even take a shot as opposed to not having any chance."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What about the little ooze? One of the little oozes?","response":"DM: Same possibility because you're currently blocked by this creature that's currently sinking into the lava."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I guess I should attack the one that's in the lava.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Well. Oh! Can I– Is he within ten or five feet of the other, the little ooze?","response":"DM: No, he's ten feet from it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, then I'll just attack him with my– I'll just attack him.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is lame, that's a lame–\nTRAVIS: Do it!","response":"DM: So you have two attacks."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh.\nLAURA: Oh right, two attacks. 13?","response":"DM: 13 misses, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Pathetic. 20-something.","response":"DM: That hits. So the first one, you fire towards it, except the arrow just (whoosh) into the lava and (puff)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I have used my flaming bowstring on the second one?","response":"DM: On the second one? If you'd like to."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sweet. Oh! And I Hunter's Marked him, because I can do that.\nLAURA: 13.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll the additional fire damage and your quarry damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 13. 19 and 22 damage.\nORION: Nice!","response":"DM: Both of its claws are at the edges of the lava, and it's pulling itself, screeching, its mouth and eyes wild with the severe pain it's feeling as it's slowly melting him from the bottom. The arrow (impact sound) into its shoulder and burst into flame. It's now freaking out. It looks like it's having a really, really rough time making its way out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: Do you want to move, or you going to stay where you are?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm gonna back up and get against the wall. Oh wait, that's me!","response":"DM: That's you there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I was thinking I was Keyleth, I'm gonna come up next to Keyleth.\nLAURA: No, against the wall.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: Okay, I'm gonna run over the dude in the lava, I'm gonna jump on him, probably make an acrobatics check and land right around here, between the two little slimes.","response":"DM: Acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.\nLAURA: Don't let the slimes hit you.\nMARISHA: Vault the lava.\nLIAM: It's acrobatics. 22.\nMARISHA: Vault that lava.","response":"DM: You jump, impact, and barely land next to them."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my gosh.\nLIAM: Now, because they are, because Grog is–","response":"DM: It does get one swipe of attack of opportunity on you as you pass by."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Fine.","response":"DM: That is going to be a 20."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. It's fine.","response":"DM: So, as you leap off of it, its hook swipes up towards you. You go ahead and take 14 points of  piercing damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's a big hit!\nLIAM: Yeah.\nLIAM: Okay. Okay and since I land, since Grog is right up against those two–","response":"DM: I will eat this later."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I can Sneak Attack one or both of them, so I'm gonna hit the one closest to the party first.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is Sneak Attack.\nLIAM: This is, this is– It's an 18.\nLIAM: Three plus seven is– this is my flametongue dagger, so that's– Oh, hold on, no, I don't know what it is yet. Where's my pencil? I'm sending my dice everywhere. Nine plus six, ten, 15, 18, 40. 58 on one slime.","response":"DM: What is the piercing damage from the dagger?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The piercing damage?","response":"DM: Daggers are piercing, so yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I don't know. What is that? Is that what's besides the Sneak Attack damage?","response":"DM: Thank you kindly. Mysterious appearance of paper towels."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's 18. If it's doubled for the Sneak Attack? I don't know. It's nine, without a Sneak Attack. 18 if it's Sneak Attack.","response":"DM: Right. Well, it's a Sneak Attack, because it is flanking."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So 18 for Sneak Attack.","response":"DM: Okay, got you. Cool."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's first dagger.\nLIAM: Second dagger attacks the other one. I just turn around and sink down into the other one for 16 with the keen, yeah, 16 with the keen dagger.","response":"DM: That hits, go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, and this is probably not Sneak Attack at this point, or is it? I don't know.","response":"DM: No, you'll do only one Sneak Attack per round."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, eight.","response":"DM: Eight, gotcha. So as you rush, you leap off, take the scratch in the air from the hook horror creature. You land on the ground, slash one with your dagger, slash the other. Both slashes are almost simultaneous. As you hit, you feel your blades gain purchase in both creatures, and you look down at your arms as the horrible burning sensation filters onto your hands as the splash-back. You take a total of 20 points of acid damage from the melee attacks you took against the creatures."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20, you said?","response":"DM: 20 total, yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispers) Oh my god.\nASHLEY: You're at 24? Fuck.\nTALIESIN: Where's the laser?\nMARISHA: So they're all still alive, all the oozes are still alive.\nTALIESIN: Laser.\nMARISHA: It was around here somewhere. You had it last.\nTRAVIS: What are you looking for?\nLAURA: What? What's happening?\nTALIESIN: Oh, never mind.\nMARISHA: Did I have it? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.\nTALIESIN: Yeah you had it, aha!","response":"DM: Percy, what you got?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I wanna move just slightly to my right. Just over there so I can get a clear shot at the oozes.","response":"DM: Okay, so right there?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, about right there, so I'm not going to hit anybody.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm gonna take two shots at the little oozes. At the–","response":"DM: This one here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, that right little ooze.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Little ooze.\nTALIESIN: First shot. 27 to hit. And that does ten points of damage. And then I'm gonna take another shot at him, I'm going to take a fire shot. And I'm gonna take a negative five to hit. And that's 14.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So that's 15 plus– that's 23 points of damage plus three points of fire damage.","response":"DM: 26, nice."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, boy. Perce!\nMARISHA: On the little ooze?\nASHLEY: 26 points of damage?\nLAURA: Woot woot!\nTRAVIS: Wow!\nTALIESIN: Plus fire.\nLAURA: Plus fire.\nTRAVIS: Get on it, nasty.\nLIAM: Pow, pow, pow, pow.\nMARISHA: All the oozes are still alive?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah!\nASHLEY: Get it!","response":"DM: Gotta eat sometime, guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm gonna bamf into an eagle.\nMARISHA: I'm gonna fly over– I think I'm going to land right by here.","response":"DM: There?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Uh-huh.\nMARISHA: And I'm gonna do Thunder Wave. Which is–","response":"DM: So you're coming out of eagle form?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So I'm coming out of eagle form. I was just using the eagle to fly.","response":"DM: Okay, okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Coming out of eagle form, and I'm gonna do my thunderpush. So I take my staff and I throw it down. Kerplash.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Today it's kerplash.\nTRAVIS: I buy kerplash.\nMARISHA: Kerplash!\nTALIESIN: Okay.\nMARISHA: It's a 15-foot cube and it pushes everything ten feet away from me. Directly away.","response":"DM: 15-foot cube, okay. So like this cube here?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Sure. Yeah, a cube in front of me.\nMARISHA: Not Grog, though. I'm gonna just–","response":"DM: You can do that. Okay, neither makes their saving throw. So go ahead and roll damage, or whatever it does."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 2d8.","response":"DM: 2d8 to each. What is the damage type on that?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Six. It just says damage and then they're pushed. I was–\nMARISHA: Ten feet. Directly away from me.","response":"DM: Yeah. So they're pushed right there. Got it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I was hoping they would go into the lava.","response":"DM: Unfortunately, it's not far enough. Is that your turn?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yep!\nASHLEY: Okay, can I sprinter's boot over to Grog? Sorry, no glasses, guys. So I don't see where I am.\nTRAVIS: A boot?","response":"DM: You can, yes."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to Cure Wounds.\nASHLEY: 'Cause that's what I do.","response":"DM: It's what you do as a healer, yo."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So let's see, 1d8 plus spell damage. Wait, so I'm gonna do it at fourth level, so that means I can roll how many times?","response":"DM: 4d8."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so–","response":"DM: Plus five."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Five, eight, 16.\nLAURA: Ooh! That's good! 24?\nASHLEY: 24. So you heal 24.\nTRAVIS: Thank you!","response":"DM: Nice."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: And then–\nLAURA: Plus, do you add that to anything?\nASHLEY: Well, he adds it to his 14 that he already has.","response":"DM: Sorry."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: And then, can I do anything else while I'm there?","response":"DM: No, bonus action to do the item, move, action to cast the spell."}
{"prompt":"ORION: No.\nASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: So that's your turn."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Right, yeah. I would like to come out of my rage.\nTRAVIS: For the first time ever.\nLAURA: Ever.\nLIAM: Wow. Not sure how I feel about that.\nTRAVIS: What do you– where do you wanna go? Towards Keyleth or toward the– Okay. I'd like to pick up Pike and run balls over this way.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right towards this area.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm all on my own.\nTRAVIS: Well, yeah, look. It nearly killed me the one time I hit it.\nORION: You shouldn't be doing melee on things that can split in half to begin with.\nLAURA: We're gonna die.\nLAURA: Oh no.\nTRAVIS: Okay.","response":"DM: So you can only move 20 feet."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right.\nORION: You messed everything up.\nLIAM: Hey man, if I can't be a hero here, where am I gonna do it?\nORION: Oh, every other time is fine.\nTRAVIS: Do you want to stay? It doesn't really matter.","response":"DM: You grab her, you turn–"}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You know what? I'll–\nMARISHA: Aim for in front of the Scientology Center. It always goes over really well.\nTRAVIS: Do you just wanna stay?\nASHLEY: I'm gonna– I'll stay, I'll stay.\nTRAVIS: I'll leave Pike where she is and I'll run up and flank Iceberg Lobsterface.","response":"DM: Right there?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, so, that's as far as you can get, unfortunately–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay.","response":"DM: – 'cause you're double-fatigued."}

{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm surrounded by shit.\nTALIESIN: It's what all the kids called me.","response":"DM: So, two attacks against you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Long story.","response":"DM: That's a 22."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.\nASHLEY: Fuck!","response":"DM: And a 19."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Okay.\nLAURA: Ugh.","response":"DM: So 24 against you, with an additional 56 points of acid damage."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wait! What?\nTRAVIS: Unconscious!\nTALIESIN: Damn it.\nLAURA: Why didn't you get acid damage?\nMARISHA: Son of a bitch.","response":"DM: They haven't hit him yet. That was just Grog running away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: Both of them getting attacks of opportunity on him, and both hitting."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I am surrounded by shit.\nASHLEY: Guys, guys, guys.","response":"DM: Grog falls face-first, right next– right, like, literally cradling– His unconscious body is cradling the two dead ogres right now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No!","response":"DM: This slight sound of 'sss' as the acid is, like, sizzling and scarring his flesh."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nobody attack the things up close!","response":"DM: That brings us to their turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, no!\nLIAM: I'm going unconscious here, kids.\nLAURA: All of our heavy hitters are dead.","response":"DM: These three oozes turn. Actually, this one's going to move here–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh, hello!","response":"DM: – towards Pike."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (Tommy Wiseau voice) Oh, hi, Pike.","response":"DM: You get an attack of opportunity on it, if you like–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, hit it!\nLIAM: Hit it? Yeah.","response":"DM: – as it slips away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Get it!\nTALIESIN: Get it!\nLIAM: Do I have to roll to do that? Right?","response":"DM: Yeah, you still have roll to hit it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 26.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Why is it going up there?\nASHLEY: You're gonna kill this thing!\nLIAM: 11.","response":"DM: 11?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Points of damage?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's the damage. 11.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.\nASHLEY: What did you guys vote on?\nMARISHA: No shit.\nLAURA: Did they vote on this?\nASHLEY: Probably.","response":"DM: So, the one that's attacking you, Pike, that is a–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You guys suck.","response":"DM: – 23, versus armor class."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yes, that hits.\nLIAM: Son of a gun.\nMARISHA: Pseudopod?\nASHLEY: Okay, so an additional 28 on top of that.\nTRAVIS: You guys are dicks.","response":"DM: Yeah, so a total of 40 points of damage from the strike."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I understand.\nMARISHA: Did he just call it a 'pseudopod'?\nLIAM: Masochists.","response":"DM: The other two are going to attack you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sure they are.","response":"DM: That's going to be a 19 versus armor class."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, that hits 'cause I'm at 19. Right? So that hits if I'm at 19?","response":"DM: It hits. Yeah. Okay. The other one is a 14, so that misses."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so I use Uncanny Dodge on the one that hit.\nMARISHA: Oh!\nTALIESIN: Nice!\nLIAM: Whoa!\nMARISHA: Yeah you do.","response":"DM: As you pull that away, you– You take half-damage from the strike?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Half-damage. That's right.\nLIAM: Oh, I am rough, kids. I am rough.\nLAURA: Plus acid?\nLAURA: Oh my god.","response":"DM: Clarota–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Clarota, save us!","response":"DM: – is going to step forward to there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Use your magic, you strange flayer, you.\nLAURA: Do not use Lightning Bolt.\nMARISHA: Yeah. No Lightning Bolt, Clarota.","response":"DM: Clarota reaches forward, uses his own– Taking a note from Tiberius, uses his Telekinesis spell. The arcanist marks on its body flare up, and as it does you can see this large creature–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: – gets lifted up, and slams on top of this hook horror–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes!\nLIAM: That's awesome.","response":"DM: – pushing it further into the lava and doing additional acid damage to the hook horror, which–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah! And it dies?\nORION: Damn hook whores!\nLIAM: (Cosby voice) You see–","response":"DM: – which completely dissolves and melts the hook horror."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (Jimmy Stewart voice) Clarence! Clarence!\nLAURA: Yeah, Scanlan!","response":"DM: – creature in the lava. Both hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes!\nLAURA: I'm full.\nLAURA: Yeah!","response":"DM: Leaving this dark, cooled kind of surface element to it. Slowly breaking apart, dissipating over the magma."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Bye, bitch.","response":"DM: End of its turn, it's going to try and make a saving throw against the domination effect. Rolls a natural 20. Breaks the effect, however I feel like it did its good for the turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Damn it. Did he take acid damage? Is he hurt?","response":"DM: Yeah, he did. He took 20 points of acid damage from each strike."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice. Good, good, good.\nASHLEY: So there is only one left?\nLAURA: No, there is two little oozes and a big one.\nLIAM: Two oozes and a monster man.\nMARISHA: (sings) One little two little three little oozes.","response":"DM: Over here?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, that's good, I can see his fanny from here. I'm going to cast Glacial Blast again, but I'm going to form a giant spike once more and jam it right in his asshole.\nLIAM: Oh, he's pulling a Vax.\nORION: And I'm going to try and catapult it right where it's over. Because it's still at the edge of the lava pool, right?","response":"DM: Mm-hm. So you're going to glacial spike in the– Kancho him. Magically kancho."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Magic ice kancho blast.\nLIAM: Up up down down left right left right.\nTRAVIS: A B A B N.\nORION: 24.","response":"DM: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah. One, two, three, four, six. That is eight. What is that, a 12? 15, 16, 18, 19. 20. 20 damage.\nORION: I'm not trying to grapple him, I'm trying to just push him.","response":"DM: Push him? Shove?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.\nLAURA: Into the lava.\nORION: Because he's like swinging at that dude so I'm like up his keister.\nORION: Okay.","response":"DM: Unfortunately, so it doesn't push him into the lava, but it does slam him and does a shit-ton of damage to him, so."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Nice.\nMARISHA: In his pooper.","response":"DM: Looking rough. Just a little bit."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah. I'll spend another two points.","response":"DM: How many points do you have now?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: After this, I'll have five.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Because we had the rest, I regenerated all my stuff.","response":"DM: Right. Right."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So I spent two already.\nTRAVIS: He's making trouble.\nORION: I spent another two on the fight. And I'm going to do another one. Up his ass again.\nORION: Yeah. 20.","response":"DM: Uh-huh."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Uh-huh.\nORION: Yeah and that is 15. 15 points of damage.","response":"DM: Makes his saving throw again, unfortunately. It does not push him. Does additional points of damage. He's looking really rough. You can see now, this ice has encrusted around the outside of its armor."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And his butt.","response":"DM: And where the wounds from the impact are, there's cracking shards of ice crystal jutting outward."}
{"prompt":"ORION: From his arsehole.","response":"DM: From his asshole. Scanlan's turn. Should have had your sheet, Scanlan. Scanlan's going to go ahead and, for the hell of it, run up and make an attack."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Eff him up, Scanlan.\nASHLEY: Let's go, Scanlan.","response":"DM: A natural 18. I'm going to assume that hits. That's going to be a 1d8 longsword damage. That's an eight plus– 12 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Woo, Scanlan.\nTRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah, Scanlan.\nASHLEY: Go Scanlan.","response":"DM: The blade swings down to where the ice has encrusted the back of its armored shell. Scanlan takes the blade, swings it down, and pierces it directly into where that ice has gathered. As it does, it cracks open the back of its armored shell. Almost peeling it open like a shrimp. You can now see all its fleshy innards are exposed to the outside. It's looking extremely, extremely close to death. It's screaming in pain, kind of thrashing about now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Shrimping, cool.","response":"DM: Vex, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. I'm gonna Lightning Bolt the bad guy.","response":"DM: This guy?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nLAURA: Oh wait, no, I should save my brother.\nLIAM: Maybe.\nLAURA: Okay, I'm going to attack one of the oozies instead.\nLIAM: The one right behind me.\nLAURA: The one right behind him.\nLAURA: Yeah. Yeah, 23.","response":"DM: Very nice, very nice, that hits"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh I Hunter's Mark him first. Bonus.\nORION: Bonus.\nLIAM: Excellent.\nLAURA: 14 for the first attack.\nASHLEY: Wait, do we still have Scanlan's inspiration song?","response":"DM: You do, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You do. You have the die.\nASHLEY: I have the die. Is what I'm talking about, sorry.\nLAURA: Do I get six on both attacks? I do, don't I?","response":"DM: Mm-hm."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah. 17 on the second attack.\nLIAM: Kill it. Kill it.","response":"DM: With a sickening (splat) sound, the ooze splatters across the floor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: Thank you.","response":"DM: Leaving a small, sizzling pool that's scarring the rock below it. You can see it slowly depressing into the ground. You gonna stay where you are?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Both daggers?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: First one's a 15.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay and that is– this is my keen dagger. That is nine.","response":"DM: Nine hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Second dagger. Definitely hits, that's a 26.","response":"DM: Hits. None of them are Sneak Attack, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's fine. This is flametongue. I don't know if fire helps, but that is an eight. So nine and an eight.","response":"DM: Nine and an eight, gotcha. Both daggers splash into it. You can see where they would slowly be scarred and damaged."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Except that they teleport back to my blink belt.\nLAURA: Yay, blink belt.","response":"DM: As they return to your belt, you can feel there a slight bit of liquid left, and you shake it off quickly."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Shite.\nLAURA: (sings) Shake it off.","response":"DM: But no other effect that that. It looks like it's having a hard time keeping its form together. It's kind of shaking and (oozing sound) as it moves. Still running towards Pike."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Finish that shit, Pike.","response":"DM: That brings us to Percy."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hit it.","response":"DM: Mm-hm."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That hits. So that's 18 points of damage.\nTALIESIN: And I'm gonna take the other shot.","response":"DM: Is this against the ooze?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. Sorry, the ooze.\nTALIESIN: And that's 13 to hit.\nASHLEY: Grog's unconscious?\nLIAM: He'll be fine in ten minutes, Pike.\nASHLEY: What?\nLIAM: He's out of the fight, but he'll be fine.\nASHLEY: Oh, okay.\nTALIESIN: And that's 11 points of damage.","response":"DM: The first shot hits, and the ooze kind of quivers. It leaves this kind of gaping hole, and it begins to slowly reform itself. Before it can, you see the other weak spot where the top of its physical form is barely wavering, and it's able to keep corporeal. You aim the second shot, and as you fire, it detonates and that portion of its upper torso– whatever it would be– gets flung off and splats against the wall, the rest of it slowly liquefying as the rest of the slime is destroyed."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Nice.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, buddy.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: So I'm going to back up against the wall. I'm going to back to the wall of the– Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay. Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do I have enough speed to get next to Vex there? 30 feet?","response":"DM: Vax, you mean? Yeah, you do."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (sings) Thorn Whip.\nMARISHA: 26.","response":"DM: That hits, definitely, go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (sings) Thorn Whip, the bitch is dead.\nMARISHA: Eight points of damage.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I pull him–","response":"DM: How do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So I take my Thorn Whip, and I go (whip sound). And I grab him. And I see he's still struggling. So I take another one and I go (whip sound) on the other one. And I just go Spiderman-style.","response":"DM: And (dragging sound). As you do it, it plummets face-first into the–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Woo!","response":"DM: – both into the magma and the slightly still-sizzling form left over from the ooze that had melted there."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Magma and acid.\nMARISHA: And just for flavor, I take a big gust of air, a big Wind Burst and I go (whoosh) down into the lava pool. Encrusting it all.","response":"DM: As you do, it slams down. You hear it scream underneath as its body begins to quiver. The Wind Burst hits, and the cool air rushes through the tunnel. All of your guys' hair and everything gets blown back for a second. You have to cover your eyes, and as you look back–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, Light!","response":"DM: As Tiberius hits Light, in the tunnel you can see the–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Grog!","response":"DM: – hook horror, which, a portion of its upper torso is now encrusted into the actual cavern floor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Awesome.\nTRAVIS: Amazing.\nLAURA: Save Grog!\nASHLEY: I'm going to go over to Grog and Cure Wounds at fourth level.\nLIAM: You tried to kill us, but you failed.\nLAURA: Don't challenge them.\nASHLEY: Don't.\nTALIESIN: Nice try.\nASHLEY: Nice job, guys.\nTRAVIS: I did a pretty decent job, actually.","response":"DM: I ate pizza in front of you guys. I don't care. It was tasty. Thank you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.\nMARISHA: I don't care. No shame.","response":"DM: Delicious pizza."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No. We're not gonna have Trinket this whole thing. We better get back to Trinket soon. I'm freaking out, you guys.\nMARISHA: That's true, if we keep going.\nASHLEY: 25 points of heal!\nLIAM: Just in seven more weeks.\nTRAVIS: Thank you!\nASHLEY: You're welcome!\nMARISHA: I might be able to guide him–\nLIAM: Trinket's on the sidelines, man.\nLAURA: That makes me so sad!\nLIAM: We're not going back.\nLAURA: And it's all you guys' fault!\nLIAM: But it was like three years, Trinket was by your side. This is the first time ever.","response":"DM: As Grog, you come to consciousness again–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Ah! Did I kill it?\nLAURA: You did, Grog! Good job!\nTALIESIN: Yes, Grog, you killed it good.\nLAURA: Also, handful of pizza.\nTRAVIS: I put my hand in my pizza!\nLIAM: You killed them all, Grog! You were magnificent!\nMARISHA: Yay, Grog!\nTRAVIS: Aha! Tell me more! (snores)\nASHLEY: Wait–\nMARISHA: Now we pass out.\nASHLEY: – so can I also do a Mass Cure Wounds? Since I just did a–","response":"DM: Yeah, if you'd like!"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. So I'll also do a Mass Cure Wounds.\nLAURA: Yay!\nLIAM: Yes, 'cause I'm at four hit points.\nASHLEY: Yeah, you're pretty bad.\nMARISHA: Oof.\nLAURA: Brother.\nTALIESIN: I'm fine.\nLIAM: Oh, brother, where art thou?\nORION: I feel fine!\nLAURA: I feel fine.\nMARISHA: Ah, me too.\nTALIESIN: I feel fine.\nLIAM: Oh! Oh! Oh! Fancy you! Blah-blah-blah-blah!\nTALIESIN: Seems that there's one table where everyone is perfectly reasonable!\nORION: All the time, yes, Vax!\nLIAM: I'm at four hit points! You go fuck yourself.\nMARISHA: Yes, everyone on this side of the table's good.\nORION: There's an acid guy! Stab.\nLIAM: I was trying to save his ass! I was hurting myself on purpose.\nASHLEY: 22 points of healing–\nLAURA: To everyone.","response":"DM: To everyone."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's pretty good.","response":"DM: Everyone heals 22 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's half-ish.\nTALIESIN: I reload.\nLAURA: Well done, well done.\nLIAM: Half-ish.\nASHLEY: Something additional.\nTRAVIS: Thank you, Pike.\nASHLEY: Oh, you're welcome, Grog! My best pal.\nTRAVIS: Hell yeah. (growling noises)\nASHLEY: (growling noises)\nTRAVIS: It's a language we speak.\nASHLEY: Yeah, man, it's like our own thing.","response":"DM: You guys push forward down the tunnel–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh!\nLIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: Limping.","response":"DM: For another 20 or so minutes, bringing yourself along, sore from the impact of the battle."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm burnt.","response":"DM: Bits of your armor scarred. By the way, your armor–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: – what type of armor was it?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It was– it's magical. I found it in the goblin city. Studded leather armor, plus two.\nLIAM: Wait. Do you know what's funny? What's funny is, the armor I had before this, that I wasn't paying attention to, was acid resistant! Isn't that funny?\nMARISHA: And now you don't have it no more?\nLIAM: That's so funny!\nLAURA: That's great!","response":"DM: Look at that!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's really funny. Keep going.\nMARISHA: That is funny.\nLIAM: It's in my bag!","response":"DM: You wipe it off. Thankfully, the magic enchantment protects the armor entirely."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ah! See! That was acid-resistant, too!","response":"DM: Grog, what armor do you have?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Even better!\nTRAVIS: Oh, it's like hides and leathers and–","response":"DM: Just regular hide."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yep.","response":"DM: Currently, as you're walking, you look down and notice that the armor on your torso has near-completely dissolved."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)\nTRAVIS: Son of a– Well, you're welcome, ladies!\nLAURA: My, my, Grog!\nTRAVIS: (sings) It's time for a show!\nORION: Grog! Will you put those away!","response":"DM: As it stands, you have no additional armor class bonus for any armor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: Your hide armor is gone. It is completely dissolved."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What about the black armor? Put on the dwarven black plate armor!\nTRAVIS: They're dwarves.\nASHLEY: What if we melt it and then make it a big one?\nLAURA: If it's magical, it might fit you if you just try it on!\nASHLEY: I don't know, would that work?\nORION: It's true!\nLIAM: Hold on, hold on. DM! DM. I take off my magical armor, which was dwarven in shape before–\nLAURA: (gasps) Oh, good!\nLIAM: – but I take it off, it shrinks down to like a little toddler–\nLAURA: Oh! Ew. Cover yourself, Vax!\nLIAM: I'm wearing, like, a Scientology unibody underwear underneath–\nLAURA: Oh, okay.\nASHLEY: Wouldn't that be– that's mormons!\nLIAM: The armor shrinks down to like toddler-size–\nORION: I don't know what that means!\nLIAM: – and I hand it to Grog.\nTALIESIN: It's probably for the best.\nLIAM: And I go to my pack and I take out my old armor, which is acid resistant. Not quite as cool as what I was wearing, but I don't want him–\nTRAVIS: You had two pairs of gloves?\nLIAM: I can't– huh?\nTRAVIS: Kidding. It's Dumb & Dumber.\nLIAM: I can't stare at his pecs for the next three days, so I'll give him my armor.\nLAURA: I can.\nLIAM: Ooh! And put on what I had on before.\nTRAVIS: Ooh!","response":"DM: Hoo! Modesty, Grog!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Studded leather armor plus two, okay?","response":"DM: So mark that for your AC."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Studded armor leather plus two.\nASHLEY: Wait, but then what are–\nLAURA: He's got his own armor.\nLIAM: I've got my old armor. I found that armor down here.\nTALIESIN: I'm gonna be the person who actually examines the cart, at this point.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh! That's a good idea.\nLAURA: Plus we have other plate armor!\nLIAM: That's a loaner.\nTALIESIN: You know, I just figured someone ought to.\nMARISHA: What the fuck did we open?\nTRAVIS: Plus two to AC?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: And it should be me.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nLIAM: No, it's more complicated than that.","response":"DM: Okay, here's the circumstance for you, real fast, before we get to that. So, Grog."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yep.","response":"DM: The armor you had on was hide, which was a dex bonus of 12 plus your dex. Studded leather is also the same, so your AC actually goes up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh! Ho! Something that you'd think!","response":"DM: So, what was your AC previously?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 18?","response":"DM: 18?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: It should now be 20."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yay! Yes!\nLAURA: Yay, Grog!\nTRAVIS: Grog takes the top off and does a–\nLIAM: Loaner! Loaner.\nTALIESIN: Put it back on.\nLIAM: Loaner.\nLAURA: It's his, he's keeping it. It's going to stink like Grog, you won't want that back.\nTRAVIS: The things I'm gonna do in this armor, you're not going to want it back. Just give me and Scanlan one night to break it in, and I promise you, it will be mine.","response":"DM: Just the two of you?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well, uh, you know what I mean. Who am I talking to?\nTALIESIN: An investigation check, what is that? Eight.","response":"DM: Okay. Looking at the cart, the cart is a rickety wooden thing, but what was in the cart was a large glass unit, a containment unit that was sealed off. You can see the inside of it has slight scarring to the glass, but it seems to be resistant to whatever the loose creature was contained in it. Along the inside of the cart, you notice there are a couple of just left over chunks of flesh of different colors, patches or pieces you see, like part of a hand that's just in there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ew.","response":"DM: Partially decomposed, to a certain extent. It looks like these were either used to feed whatever the creature was in there or remnants of some other strange collection. Based on the best you guys can ascertain, this creature was part of the experimentation-type process that the weird naga creature you fought earlier came from."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, great, so there could be more.\nTRAVIS: Did we search the ogres?\nLAURA: Yeah! Loot the ogres!","response":"DM: Ogres are wearing nasty, nasty, tattered at this point, hide armor"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Grog could do it.","response":"DM: They both carry total, amongst the two of them, about 24 pieces of gold."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sweet.\nTRAVIS: I wanna take it.\nLAURA: I add it to party funds.\nTRAVIS: I am searching the ogres, and I keep the 24 gold, but I give two to Vax.\nLIAM: Thank you.\nTRAVIS: You're welcome.\nMARISHA: Can I go and grab shards of the broken glass of the case?","response":"DM: If you'd like to, yeah. So mark that in your inventory, you have some hand-sized shards of broken glass."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And two to Pike for healing me.\nASHLEY: Oh, thanks.","response":"DM: Anything else you guys wish to do in this section?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So we searched the ogres, that's it. I guess we should just start walking further down.\nTRAVIS: You take a poo on the black puddle of acid?\nTALIESIN: I think– Well, no. That's the only heat source, that's the only lava there was, and now it's cool.","response":"DM: And now it has cooled, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, never mind, then.\nMARISHA: Sorry.\nTRAVIS: I'd like to take a hit dice.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and do that. As many as you'd like."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Let's rest for a half-hour or so.\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Take a moment, you can spend any hit dice now that you need to heal yourself. Just make sure to mark how many you've used."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I just hear the sounds of ones.\nASHLEY: (gasps)\nLAURA: Mother bitches.\nMARISHA: It looped around?\nMARISHA: Well, we should go pick up Trinket.\nTALIESIN: At least you get your bear.\nLAURA: (gasps) Trinket!\nMARISHA: Let's go pick up Trinket.\nLAURA: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.\nTRAVIS: You're going to get your bear killed.\nLIAM: Can you explain? I don't think I understand.\nMARISHA: We left Trinket over there.\nLIAM: Can you explain with your map, Matt?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We're at the bottom of the cave.\nORION: We went down and just–\nLIAM: I get we doubled back, but it would help the visual, I think.","response":"DM: Yeah so– and I'll have more of this for you guys next week."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It was a warp tube.","response":"DM: The path you guys took was essentially– lead to this back area, which I'll draw for next week, and a tunnel that curved all the way around and exited right there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So we're–\nLAURA: We'll go get Trinket, and then we'll go down the path we should have gone down in the first place next week.\nMARISHA: Son of a bitch.\nTALIESIN: Except we get Trinket.\nLAURA: But Trinket!\nMARISHA: So it's not useless.\nLAURA: It was absolutely useless.\nLIAM: That's fate, that's kismet.\nMARISHA: Is there, like, any other way down here?","response":"DM: Other than the fact you've completely destroyed one of the mind flayer generals as well as the one helming the war camp above. You've acquired new magical items and defeated one of the abominations that was created for the siege war. I think you accomplished quite a few things, though maybe not as directly as you were hoping."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And we acquired our bear.\nLAURA: We got our bear back.\nLIAM: You go on it, right?\nLAURA: He's with me, and he cast Featherfall.","response":"DM: You can go ahead and cast Fly on your bear. Trinket awkwardly (bear noises) manages to swim her way down to the bottom floor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Come, Trinket, come.","response":"DM: As you make your way to the base of the watery lake, at the bottom, you can see a swish to the water, and a very familiar sight briefly shows itself in the distance. As you see a slick domed fish-like head protrude with a few tentacles in the distance, you all instinctively step quite a distance away, and it seems to withdraw back into the water."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I– While I see it real quick, I'm going to go ahead and channel and cast Beast Sense through it.","response":"DM: Nothing bestial of it. This is not a natural creature."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Good to know.","response":"DM: Clarota once again whispers to the rest of you, “Stay at bay. The Aboleth is dangerous.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Aboleth?\nMARISHA: Aboleth.\nASHLEY: Guys, this is really familiar to me.\nLAURA: We spent a whole game doing–\nMARISHA: Well, we took a wrong turn, I guess.\nLIAM: I don't know. We were flexing our muscles a little bit.\nLAURA: Flexing our muscles.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I like it.\nLAURA: Plus you got us new armor out of it.\nTRAVIS: And I got naked, too.","response":"DM: As you guys begin to step into the next lengths of your subterranean journey, we'll pick that up next week. Thank you all so much for tuning into Critical Role."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Man, oh man, oh man.","response":"DM: Some tense battles. An intense encounter choice on you guys' part. Well done on that."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I want to keep going.\nLIAM: Who's this guy?","response":"DM: What is this?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Huzzah.\nZAC: I ask whoever hasn't signed this, we're going to pass it around to all sign it for Amy.","response":"DM: Awesome, we'll all do that."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: As a thank-you for Amy, she's an avid fan.\nLAURA: Yay!","response":"DM: Thank you, Amy, that's awesome."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thanks for being a fan.\nASHLEY: Thanks, Amy.\nZAC: As a personal challenge, guys, from me to you, I think we are, what are we, 18 away, Lucas?\nLUCAS: 19.\nLAURA: 19?","response":"DM: 19 away from our next package?"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: From the next one.\nLUCAS: Is it at 1,550?\nZAC: Yeah.\nLUCAS: Oh, we're 29 away.\nLAURA: Oh, okay.","response":"DM: Aw."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Are you sure?\nLUCAS: Yeah, we're at 1,521.\nZAC: Okay, so we've got a little bit of a ways to go, but I'm going to go ahead and have these guys sign this one as well, and I'm going to push you guys that by the end of tonight, if we reach 1,550, I'll go ahead and throw this in with the next promo kit, as well. And if not I'll hang onto it for myself, and I won.","response":"DM: Boom."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Thank you guys so much. That was fun. It gets more intense like every week.","response":"DM: That's apparently the path this is taking, so–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We keep getting knocked unconscious.\nTRAVIS: We make amazing decisions.\nLAURA: You?\nTRAVIS: Sons of bitches.","response":"DM: Yeah, second week in a row."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (sings) Why can't we be friends?\nALL: (sing) Why can't we be friends?\nLAURA: Is that a total party kill?","response":"DM: Total party kill."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: I don't get angry. Lucas gets angry, though.\nMARISHA: You don't get angry? Have you played Dark Souls or Demon Souls? Because–\nZAC: I think actually–","response":"DM: Demon Souls mimics, man, I know the pain you're in for."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: What was it like, Bachee or something like that? Man, that game pissed me off.\nORION: Bocce ball?\nZAC: Wings of– ire, ear, something like that.","response":"DM: Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Man, that was heavy. Would any of you guys be interested in sticking around to dance a round or two if we were to go to Just Dance? It's a nightly staple here. We end the nights with dancing. I don't know if you guys have seen that ridiculousness, but–","response":"DM: Who would want to stick around for that?"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: They're all shivering in fear, you guys\nLIAM: How soon will that start? I'll stay for 20.","response":"DM: We can stay for a little bit."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: I bet they're are all going to ask for dancing now.\nLUCAS: See a lot of Bloodborne, actually.\nZAC: Oh, really?","response":"DM: Oh, I live for Bloodborne, man."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Well, the second–\nSAM: Doesn't matter.\nASHLEY: Hey, that's me!","response":"DM: Grog having his proverbial brains blown out by an intellect devourer. The party then decided to make friends with a mind flayer, an illithid that had been cast out from its people seeking vengeance and possible return to its people. Upon making this alliance, they made an attack on the dwarven, or the duergar, war camp that is threatening to rise up and attack Kraghammer from deep within the mountains themselves. The attack was successful. The general was killed, interrogated, and some interesting information was gleaned from him before his brain was sucked out from his head by Clarota, the mindflayer friend. However, this attack also announced to the local war camp of your presence and in the process of attempting  to escape, the druid was damaged and lost her eagle form and thus began a freefall of many party members. A haphazard attempt to use the magic carpet far over its weight limit led most of the party to come crash landing and nearly killing everyone. Managed to escape, walled themselves in thanks to  Keyleth's stone wall spell. And after staying the evening in one of the deeper tunnels, and barely avoiding a roving band of duergar there, you managed to find yourselves in battle with two ogres carrying some sort of strange, mutated, black pudding ooze contained in a glass container. The glass container being shattered, of course, by an explosive arrow created by Percy and fired by Vex."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Go us!","response":"DM: At the very start of the battle, led into a very rough battle with this strange mutating ooze that kept splitting and splitting, until through some good teamwork, crafty use of telekinesis and a nearby lava pool, and general high damage rolls, you guys managed to survive the encounter."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Barely.","response":"DM: Making your way to the bottom of this tunnel, you found yourself looping back around to the large crevice where the giant waterfall had fallen in before, where you had met Clarota. Which allowed you to retrieve your bear Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah! Trinket!\nSAM: I was just so out of it last time. Have we rested? Are we in some need of rest?\nLAURA: We should probably rest.\nSAM: What are we around? What's near us? Is this just a tunnel? Is there any sort of shelter, caves?\nLAURA: We're by that lake with the giant monster.\nLIAM: We circled all the way back around.\nSAM: Oh shit.\nLAURA: And went down to that place that you told us not to go in the first place? Yeah, that's where we ended up.\nSAM: How was that for you?","response":"DM: So essentially there was–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We're back in the camp.","response":"DM: You're under the camp. You're where the giant chasm leads down into the waterfall. There is a pool of water at the bottom where the aboleth was in the water."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right, so we don't really - oh, we can take hit points.","response":"DM: You guys can take a short rest and use your hit dice to heal up. You didn't take any damage last game. Thankfully you stayed out of the fray."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So I'm okay. That's all I need to know.","response":"DM: You did use one of your Dominate spells."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.","response":"DM: Only thing of note. So the rest of you who need to heal up can use this time to take a short rest and use your hit dice to heal up on your own."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm ready. Who we fighting next?\nSAM: Anyone need some healing? Are we all okay? Are we all good?\nASHLEY: I think we're all good. Where's everybody at in terms of…\nORION: Well, I'm fine.\nLAURA: On a personal level, or?\nASHLEY: You mean like in life, or?\nSAM: As we survey the area, how many tunnels we looking at? What's our options here?\nTRAVIS: He's back, he's back.\nORION: Would you calm down?","response":"DM: Let me pull out this visual aid for you. This is the tunnel sequence you guys have traversed down to the main area where the goblin encampment was. This is the large bridge that went across the giant chasm to where the duergar war camp was. This is the giant drop-off at the waterfall. You guys are currently in this section about to go deeper into this tunnel where a series of small magma trickles are pouring out of the rock."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So we never went up to the war camp and through it.","response":"DM: You did."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh we did!\nLIAM: We crashed down by the tunnel, we fled. We sealed up the way behind us, ran in.\nSAM: Got it. So we should keep going? We should just keep going. Magma? Follow the magma.\nLIAM: Well I recommend. We don't want to go up and through the camp again?\nLAURA: No no no, we're going into the cavern.\nLIAM: So we're going to backtrack the way we came to that war camp road, yes?\nLAURA: No, we're going into the tunnel.\nSAM: Did you see the visual aid?\nORION: Yes, we are going into the lava tunnel.\nLAURA: No no no, in through the tunnel.\nLIAM: I'll just follow. I thought I understood.\nSAM: I mean there might be something to be gleaned from going back to the war camp.\nLAURA: That tunnel.\nLIAM: We went out of there.\nLAURA: No no no no no.","response":"DM: You guys came through here, you traveled across over the war camp, went back here and tunneled below."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And popped this out right there. So now we're going into this.","response":"DM: Correct. Maps."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And just to make sure that my memory is on point–\nTRAVIS: It's not.\nLIAM: –Before we circled back around, we hit a fork in the road where we could have gone up and we could have gone down.","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So that's behind us.\nLAURA: That's behind us, we're going down down down.\nLAURA: Shall we?\nASHLEY: We shall!\nSAM: Is Clarence with us still?","response":"DM: Clarota is indeed with you. Clarota took a large black iron duergar bolt to the chest earlier and is mostly recovered but is still even more hunched than usual."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does he need healing?\nASHLEY: He also ate those brains.","response":"DM: The brains helped him–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Helped him a little bit?","response":"DM: –keep healthy, but he's still a little wounded but he's taking his time to rest up. He seems to be okay. Not as worse for wear as he was before. A slight wheeze that's always to him still present."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: He's just always a little weezy.\nLAURA & LIAM: (meh meh meh sounds)","response":"DM: Sounds just like that. So, as you guys begin to push down into this lower chasm, the temperature of the air itself grows steadily warmer and warmer with a drier heat."}
{"prompt":"ORION: This feels nice.","response":"DM: You find yourselves, especially those of you with thick armor–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh, it's so hot!","response":"DM: –You find that sweat beads begin to trickle down the side of your face–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm sweating!\nMARISHA: You're all glisteny!","response":"DM: –And begin to pool and gather in parts of your chestplate."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Pike, if you'd like me to hold your armor or do you want me to take it off for a little while?\nASHLEY: No, I'll keep it on just for safety.\nSAM: Let it hang out a little bit?\nLIAM: Do you even lift, bro?\nSAM: Just saying, you might feel more comfortable with a loose fitting sort of cloak?\nLAURA: Scanlan, stop being creepy!\nSAM: I'm not creepy! I'm just trying to be mindful!\nASHLEY: No, it's fine Scanlan.\nTRAVIS: Very considerate of you, a gentleman's offer.\nASHLEY: Yeah, it's okay. I'll keep it on.\nSAM: I'll just have to use my imagination.\nMARISHA: A gentleman's offer, yes. That's what we'll call it from now on.\nTRAVIS: What permission?\nSAM: Onward.","response":"DM: Pressing further down, the air itself that once had a kind of a hint of that sulfur smell, is now becoming stronger and stronger as you step deeper and deeper into this cavernous tunnel. It rests about 30 feet to 40 feet at width and about 25, 30 feet up and it varies to come pinched tighter or wider at moments, but it continues to be a steady downward climb in a continuous direction. The small trickles, some of them pool and gather into these small, magma cups if you will. Molten hot magma, I knew it was coming."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (murmurs) I was just wondering if it would happen.","response":"DM: Ooh, that's minus 200 experience points."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I feel a bit weaker now.","response":"DM: You get about 20 or 30 minutes deeper into this tunnel before the sweltering heat gets noticeably warmer and as you crest a slight incline and decline over a small hill portion of this tunnel, you can see now a large portion of the rock has collapsed on the left side and a gargantuan pool of magma is pooling into the tunnel, essentially covering half of the tunnel you are traversing down. It can be walked on the side of safely at about two or three at shoulder width, but you only have about a 15 foot width here and the rest of it is just extremely bright, hot, molten rock."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does it hurt us to get near it?","response":"DM: No, but it's uncomfortable and something to be very aware of and to watch your step."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I feel great!","response":"DM: You feel great."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I would just like to point out that we're nine adults playing don't touch the hot lava at the moment.\nSAM: Keyleth, you don't have any way of - say it gets hotter than this? You don't have any way of getting some water out here?\nORION: Ooh! I do! And I pull out an empty bottle.\nLAURA: Oh? Oh?\nLIAM: Tiberius, I've seen that bottle a lot. What does it do?\nORION: Oh! Um well, uh. I pull out two bottles. This one - they're both empty bottles - but this one is an air bottle and this one is a water bottle.\nLIAM: Oh! Thank you! That clears that up!\nTRAVIS: Even I feel dumber right now.\nSAM: Your intelligence is now four.\nTRAVIS: Four…three and a half.\nLIAM: Does it make a lot of water?\nORION: Oh! This, if we ever need air–\nSAM: I think that's the water one that you just pulled out.\nORION: I take it out (wind SFX). I control a small gust.\nLAURA: Yes, but what about water? Oh my.","response":"DM: Okay. So a little bit of water just begins to pour perpetually, and without seeming end due to the size of the bottle."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, nice!\nORION: So, if you want to just squirt - and I do a small, little squirt-blasts on Scanlan.\nSAM: Ahh!\nLAURA: Oh, okay. Lovely.\nLIAM: Is that unlimited?\nORION: Well, of course it is! Why would I carry a non-magical item on me? That's ridiculous.\nASHLEY: Just a water bottle.\nORION: So yes, Scanlan, we're fine.\nSAM: That's good to know.\nLAURA: So, should we try to cross this little path here?\nASHLEY: That sounds cool!\nSAM: That's really cool.\nLAURA: Can I use my tracking to see any of those duergar? To see if any of them have passed through the area; if there's a large group of them ahead of us?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I can use my tracking and my favored terrain to see how many within six miles, if there's a large group of them.\nLIAM: First roll.","response":"DM: I believe it's survival."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh! Here we go!\nTRAVIS: Do it for the Star Wars trailer.\nMARISHA: Roll. Roll. Roll.","response":"DM: This is with advantage, I believe, because it's your favored terrain, correct?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, okay.\nLAURA: Okay, that's better. Is that it?\nLIAM: Survival.\nLAURA: 21?\nTRAVIS: Awesome. Great.","response":"DM: Large, large creatures. So, there's also things that exist outside of the tunnel system."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Like Tremors?\nLAURA: So, as quickly as possible, we should get through these tunnels, I assume?","response":"DM: Probably a good idea. As a note though, you said within six miles?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.\nSAM: six miles?!","response":"DM: As you continue tracking down this tunnel - and it takes you a good three or four hours to finally reach a point where the tunnel begins to widen up - you assess that, maybe three miles up, there is a localized town. Or, at least, a population of duergar amassed  in a central place."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Check out the brain on Brad!\nLAURA: So three to four miles up, you said, from where we are at this point?","response":"DM: Yeah. From where you began."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Should we be stealthing?\nLAURA: We should probably start stealthing at this point, yes.\nLIAM: Yes. I was about to say I'd like to move ahead of the group a bit and start sneaking along.","response":"DM: Let's do that! Go ahead and roll stealth."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do I have advantage like my sister had for–","response":"DM: You do not."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should we all try to stealth?\nLIAM: 26 for me.","response":"DM: This would be a group stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 26. I've tiptoed away.\nSAM: 19.\nMARISHA: 15.\nTALIESIN: Seven.\nTRAVIS: 17.\nASHLEY: Seven.\nLAURA: 20.\nLIAM: 26.","response":"DM: Picking up on the shortcomings of a handful of members of your group, you do manage to maintain what you feel is a fairly stealthy advance deeper into this tunnel system. About an hour and a half of perpetual travel, as the tunnel slowly widens further and further, with every quarter mile or so, you eventually get to a point where the tunnel shoots open into a gargantuan cavern. A chamber nearly a mile and a half across from this visual point."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (quietly)…of secrets?","response":"DM: It is extremely tall, with hundreds of very jagged stalagmites hanging from the ceiling, and rock formations that rise and fall at different points of the topography. This entire tunnel is built in this strange, large, natural, downward curve that disappears out of sight about a mile ahead and to the left. But this huge tunnel is lit with what looks like maybe two to three dozen various small lava falls that are pouring down the sides of this giant cavern's structure. You also see some small pockets of that red glow stone that a lot of these Dwarven tunnels tend to use  as a light source. You also, as you begin to step into this, carefully - you, taking point on this, both the twins; you notice - on the far end of this cavern… Well, first off, the entire landscape is rough and craggy, with large, black, obsidian spikes just jutting out of the ground at various points. Whether it be seismically created or otherwise, it's a very unwelcoming atmosphere. And that sulfurous smell is extremely strong. Even though you've gotten used to it as far as you can for this travel, it's still a very pungent odor and you find that it's going to be very difficult for you to make out any other scent in this location right now other than that horrible mixture of chemicals that probably isn't very healthy to be breathing at the moment. What you see across the chamber, your eyes focus on a small cluster of buildings, it looks, of a similar construct as the barracks that you saw at the war camp. You can probably surmise somewhere in the neighborhood of about 20 to 25 of these structures, all localized in this one area that is punctuated with - you can count about seven of these black obsidian spires that rise out at different points around like watchtowers."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Still natural?","response":"DM: No, these are constructed. These are very smooth and have that rigid Dwarvish construction with a jagged edge to each one of the leveled lips of these towers. The one that you can see closest to you,  which is about a quarter mile off, you can just barely make out what looks like a couple of duergar walking across one of the upper levels and what looks like some sort of ballista and/or anti-personnel weapon that is put–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is where Kima's being held.\nSAM: How do you know that?\nLAURA: She had a vision.\nORION: Plus, it's a really big thing.\nSAM: That's true.","response":"DM: These giant bolt-throwers currently reside on each one of these, and then in the center of this cluster of buildings, you see standing a gargantuan ebony fortress. Serrated stonework marks the top of each wall and more of these giant bolt-throwers are mounted across the parapets. A massive magma fall descends from the rocky ceiling, right above the stronghold, onto the roof and is forked onto each side and then continues to flow down, buttressing each side of the stronghold almost as  a defense mechanism, like they built it intentionally underneath this magma fall."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wow.\nLAURA: Oh, that's where the trapdoor is!\nSAM: What? Trapdoor?\nTRAVIS: There's a trapdoor.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Wait…under the magma?\nLAURA: You missed a lot, Scanlan.\nMARISHA: Oh, right.\nSAM: I was with you the whole time.\nORION: Yes, but you were never paying attention.\nSAM: I was drunk.\nORION: You got that new magazine and you've been staring at it a long time.\nSAM: Well, it's hot gnomes.\nLIAM: Vax creeps back to Pike and ushers her up to the front. Do you recall any of the details from your vision,  from your dreams?\nASHLEY: I've definitely been here in my vision.\nASHLEY: I do remember that much. All of this looks familiar, and I think we're in the right place.\nLAURA: Sweet.\nORION: Very good. That's all important.\nASHLEY: Do we know what else is around? What was the building again? With the–\nSAM: It's a fortress.","response":"DM: The giant building you see is called Emberhold. That's what it's been referred to as."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And it's not a temple?","response":"DM: It's not a temple, it is a fortress. The temple of where apparently K'Varn as far as you know exists is further below in the fungal forest that surrounds this ancient city ruin that has been repurposed by the illithids that Clarota actually came from."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, yes! And we know here, because the general that we mind melded - Clarota read his brain.\nSAM: Yeah, I was there!\nLAURA: I know. It's just you were drunk, so I'm reiterating it.\nSAM: Yeah yeah, good, thank you for that.\nORION: Just making sure.\nTALIESIN: You had this very vivid look the whole time.\nLAURA: So remember, Scanlan, that the general said that on the left side of the fortress–\nSAM: Of the fortress.\nLAURA: –is how we can get into the trapdoor.\nSAM: How we can get into the trapdoor, exactly.\nLIAM: By the smaller–\nSAM: Smaller–\nLIAM: –of two lava flows.\nLAURA: By the smaller of two lava flows.\nSAM: –of two…what?\nLAURA: Lava flows.\nASHLEY: So what we're looking at is the fortress?\nLAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: You're looking at Emberhold itself, the center of the duergar society and from what you've gleaned from two different duergar that you've interrogated, supposedly where Lady Kima has been held should she still–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: by King Murghol?","response":"DM: –By King Murghol. Murghol and Queen Ulara."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: From our vantage point can we see the two lava flows that we were warned about?","response":"DM: It is way too far away. That stronghold is probably a good mile and a half away from you right now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So, there is a lot of cover as we go near it because of all the…?","response":"DM: There is a lot of cover, yes, but it's a lot of open area with cover, so it's one of those you're just going to have to be careful  as you move through."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Percy.\nLAURA: It's pretty dark here, right?\nTALIESIN: Yes?\nSAM: How long would it take you to make a nuclear weapon?","response":"DM: Yes, it's pretty dark here, the only reason you can see much is because of the low light vision."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A very long time. If I start it right now..","response":"DM: Even at this radius, things you could see nearby, a light source would be very helpful in making sure that you can see details and not fall in anything you  don't want to, but it also makes you very visible to anything else out there, so you have to decide."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Between the lava and the red stones, the twins can see, correct? Because of the dim light.","response":"DM: You can see near, but these are things that are a mile away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But nothing at a distance.\nLIAM: Right, right, right.","response":"DM: It's way too far away. The reason you can make out this small city and Emberhold itself is because there are clusters of the red glowstone used within that city and the giant magma fall that currently envelops the sides of the stronghold, making it very, very visible and easy to pick out against the rest of the cavern."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So this is a whole little city down here.\nLIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: About a mile off, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So we should keep to the left and head down that direction and try to–\nMARISHA: I'm actually gonna go ahead and cast Pass Without A Trace.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (whispering) What does that do?\nMARISHA: (whispering) It makes us really stealthy.\nSAM: Oh, cool!\nORION: It's the thing that saved our butts last time.\nLIAM: It quiets your parts.","response":"DM: You've seen this before. As she finishes her incantation, you feel the darkness of the shadows around you begin to coalesce and almost stick to you. Although there's no substance, for a moment you almost find yourself repulsed by it, until you realize that it's probably an advantageous circumstance. But you find yourself now much easier to slip  into the surrounding shadows."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: They're nice shadows.\nTRAVIS: And I'm doing my flower girl routine with the dust of tracelessness. Just over here, over there, put a little on Pike.\nTALIESIN: We don't really need - Well…\nTRAVIS: What? We've got a really large amount.\nORION: You never know, Percy, he does it all the time. We don't know how many times it's saved us.\nTALIESIN: I suppose that's fair.\nSAM: What's our angle here, gents?\nLIAM: We need to get closer up. We need to find this trap door, because it's suicide  going in the front.\nLAURA: Right. And Lady Kima's being held here.\nSAM: So there's an entrance to this trap door that possibly is on the outskirts of the city?\nLIAM & LAURA: Yes.\nSAM: So we need to find it.\nLAURA: Yes, it's on the left.\nSAM: Oh, it's on the left?\nLAURA: Yes, so we're heading left and going–\nSAM: Let's do it!\nLIAM: The twins will creep - continue ahead.\nASHLEY: Yeah, you guys real stealthy, so–\nTRAVIS: Yeah, keep creeping, keep creeping.\nASHLEY: –Probably smart that you're moving ahead.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'll take point on the group that's following.\nLAURA: You guys take care of Trinket as I'm ahead of you.\nASHLEY: Come on, Trinket.\nTRAVIS: (growling sounds) Me and Trinket are telling jokes in the back of the group.\nSAM: Quietly.\nMARISHA: Classic Trinket.\nLAURA: Oh, I'll go back, then. Should I? Or is it okay because we're all together?","response":"DM: It's okay because you guys are in theory together. I'm going to say essentially you're just marking places where the terrain would be dangerous, to watch your step and to be wary of any locations that might be unsafe for load bearing, anything like that."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, I saw that look. You calling me load bearing?","response":"DM: Yes!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's honest.","response":"DM: Specific. As you guys begin to curve around the left, everyone roll a perception check real fast."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, snap.\nTRAVIS: Prepare for a natural… lap.\nORION: With our proficiency bonus?","response":"DM: Only if you're proficient with perception."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can't read the dice. It's either a six or a nine. No idea.\nORION: 15.","response":"DM: Is there a dot on the bottom?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, that's the bottom?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's a six!\nASHLEY: Oh, Scanlan!\nMARISHA: 16.\nORION: 15.\nTALIESIN: 24.\nTRAVIS: Nine.\nASHLEY: 19.\nLAURA: 20.\nLIAM: 25.\nLIAM: Dtdtdt!","response":"DM: –You hear a slight distant clanking of metal and voices. Low, kind of conversational voices. Too far for you to listen at this point. But you guys immediately stop everyone. And you can just see, over maybe a good 70, 80 feet from your distance, heading up the path you guys had just began to skirt around, a small, what looks like a roving patrol of duergar. Probably the ones that go up and down the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I can ambush them!\nSAM: Ambush them?\nLAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!\nTALIESIN: (whispering) Let them pass.\nSAM: Why don't we create a distraction and get rid of them?\nLAURA: Well, okay, but I can - (whispering) I can be really quiet. I can do Hide In Plain Sight now. So, I could completely hide myself standing there.\nSAM: How many are there? Are you gonna kill–","response":"DM: No one's seen them, you can just hear them. No one's gone to check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Can I look?\nLIAM: Yes, let's go look.","response":"DM: You can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, let's look.\nLIAM: Let's go catch one.\nMARISHA: (quietly) Can we not just hide?","response":"DM: Just the two of you?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: How far away are we from them? Like, in distance?","response":"DM: Right now? You're guessing about 80 to 70 feet, but closing fast. Not closing directly on you, because they're doing a slightly different path."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) Everybody stay quiet.\nTALIESIN: They're taking the path that we're not on, right?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So, if we hide–\nLAURA: They won't find us.\nTALIESIN: –They won't find us.\nLAURA: Potentially.\nORION: And they can just pass.\nLAURA: But I want to hear what they're saying.","response":"DM: Okay, so all of you guys, who's–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We'll all hide. I go ahead and cast Guidance on Vax.\nLAURA: What does that mean?\nLIAM: Vex.","response":"DM: Is that a concentration spell?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm Vex, he's Vax. We look alike, it's understandable.","response":"DM: Just checking if it's concentration or not, because that will definitely break your other spell. I'll pull it up here real fast."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, no, then don't. Keep Pass Without A Trace.\nTRAVIS: Well, we could just get this party started right here, if we want to.\nMARISHA: Let me see, it might just be–","response":"DM: Guidance is concentration."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, sorry, you don't have my guidance.\nLAURA: That's okay, that's okay.\nMARISHA: No guidance here.\nLIAM: Why don't we go just up ahead and scout?\nLAURA: Just a little bit ahead and see what we can see.","response":"DM: Okay. So, the two of you kind of work up. As the rest of you are holding back, the twins slink between the various rock formations and strange, jagged spires that are currently peppering this entire underground landscape. You get up to a point where you're maybe 10 feet from the road and with your backs against the rock, you can begin to see the roving band slowly move around."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (whispering) Band?","response":"DM: The band of duergar. You count, at quick glance, roughly 12 to 15."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, yeah…","response":"DM: Armed with hammers, halberds, um… Both of you guys roll a perception check right now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Perception check.","response":"DM: Perception check. Specific for this one."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 26.\nLAURA: 17.","response":"DM: You make out that one of them holds no weapons. Instead is dressed in–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait, no! I get advantage on perception, because I'm in my favored terrain.","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I already perceived it.\nLAURA: Oh, yeah, never mind, okay.","response":"DM: You can also perceive, I suppose."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (whispering) I already perceived it.\nLAURA: Yes.\nLIAM: What is he saying?\nLAURA: Hold on.","response":"DM: –You pick up bits and pieces as they begin to pass by. You hold your breath, hoping nobody notices you, and so far so good. They begin to walk slowly past the rock you guys are against. You overhear one of them say: “Well, keep your eyes peeled, eh. That thing is still out there.” And the other one slaps him and says: “Horek says that it ate a whole scouting party in seconds.” Another one goes: “Listening to Horek was your first mistake. Shut up and keep walking.” And they all keep pushing. At which point, the same scared one from before says: “I mean, if that one went crazy, well, can't the other ones crack, too? I don't know if I feel safe around any of K'varn's pets anymore at this rate.” And by that point, they begin to slowly move past and their voices begin to fade, as they continue up the path you guys just traversed down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)","response":"DM: Up to the lava tunnels."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh shit.\nTRAVIS: Good thing I was clearing our footprints.","response":"DM: It's actually a very good thing."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's a win for Grog.\nTRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) Is it? Did I do something good?\nLIAM: Good job, dummy.\nORION: These are amazing.\nMARISHA: What are they?\nLAURA: Fried banana.\nMARISHA: Oh! That's fun.","response":"DM: Fried bananas? Toss me one of those. Is that from the chat?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You're working. You don't have time to eat.\nMATT & LAURA: Thank you, chatroom.\nMARISHA: Thank you.\nORION: Thanks so much.","response":"DM: I know it's not a piece of pizza, guys, but I'll do what I can."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Next time, sushi. Sushi.\nZAC: (off screen) Instajur and somebody who didn't put their name on it.","response":"DM: (disappointed) Oh."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Instajur and mystery guy, thanks!\nZAC: Coleson sent the pizza.\nALL: Thank you!\nASHLEY: Oh my god, that's so good.","response":"DM: The sound of the duergar walking eventually fades and you feel pretty confident that you're safe to return to the rest of the party."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. So, we walk back. So, apparently, number one, big party, we don't want to fight them if we don't have to. Secondly, there's some weirdo creature that's gotten loose and is very, very bad and it's killed multiple duergar already.\nLIAM: Quickly.\nLAURA: That might be the thing–\nSAM: No indication of what kind of a creature it was?\nLAURA: No, but it might be the thing we already killed. It could've been the thing with the plate that showed up in the camp, I don't know.\nSAM: The thing with the plate?\nASHLEY: The thing in the red rider wagon.\nTRAVIS: The bullet, the bullet.\nLAURA: The big thing.\nTRAVIS: Bulette.\nMARISHA: Bulé.\nSAM: Oh!\nLAURA: It could've been that, I'm not sure.\nTRAVIS: It's a French dog.\nMARISHA: It's French, yeah.\nLAURA: Regardless, we should be very careful, traveling forward.\nTALIESIN: I've seen your sheet, you don't speak French.\nSAM: We could use that to our advantage.\nORION: We could! We could. We could scare them off quite easily.\nMARISHA: I had a grandmother who did, okay?\nORION: I can make funny sounds.\nLAURA: Should we keep moving forward at a very stealthy sort of pace?\nORION: Waka waka.","response":"DM: Certainly."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The stealthy mix.","response":"DM: You guys push forward, keeping that wide, kind of left curve, which adds a fair amount of time to your travel, as you're being careful and moving at a very very heavy, circular arc around the duergar city."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm looking for doors and stuff as we go. I don't know why.","response":"DM: Sure! Looking for doors!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, there's a trap door somewhere, right?\nORION: (old man voice) There's doors in them there caves.","response":"DM: Good thinking."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That'll be the fortress, maybe, but–\nLAURA: Possibly. Could be farther. Can we see the molten things that he was talking about? The lava flows?","response":"DM: Still too far away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Still too far away.","response":"DM: As you begin to make your way around, you're just starting to get to the point where you can see the front of the fortress. And you can see where the magma fall splits and just coalesces around each side of the stronghold. Almost like a blanket waterfall on each side. It does split up at certain points, you can begin to start making it out."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Where does the magma runoff lead to? Does it just pour out? Does it fill a moat?","response":"DM: It's hard to tell from this distance, unfortunately. You'd have to get closer up to see. About an hour of travel around the side–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh wow.\nLIAM: I'm so bored.\nTALIESIN: If only there were a way to just speed up this exposition somehow.\nTRAVIS: Of all the things.","response":"DM: Indeed."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Life isn't like that.\nORION: Wow, Percy!\nTALIESIN: Sorry.\nLAURA: (whispering) Be quiet.","response":"DM: It's at this point, immediately catching your eye, Vex, one of the nearby obsidian spires is a different  color than the rest. The rest are like a deep black, glass shiny color. This one is a dull crimson."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh! We should go towards that one.\nSAM: Because it's a different color?\nLIAM: Let's go check it out.\nLIAM: Just eat your banana, the twins will go check it out.","response":"DM: Black obsidian, this was red–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do you not know anything?\nLIAM: The twins are gonna go have a peek.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm coming with.","response":"DM: Scanlan comes with. Go ahead and roll a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm not coming with.\nSAM: Not my strong suit.\nTRAVIS: Don't fuck it up.\nLAURA: No, Scanlan, what did you do?\nLIAM: You dick!\nTRAVIS: Did you?\nMARISHA: What did you do?\nORION: You can change your mind.\nASHLEY: Wait, wait, I go and–\nSAM: I've got advantage, don't I?\nASHLEY: –I grab Scanlan and I kiss him on the cheek and make him stay.\n(all gasp and exclaim)\nORION: What?!\nTALIESIN: Way to take one for the team.\nORION: Oh no.\nTRAVIS: I don't know.\nLIAM: You just stopped him from farting into his flute.\nASHLEY: Persuasion? That would be…\nORION: Ladies and gentlemen, this is a huge moment.\nMARISHA: Can you roll a persuasion against a critical fail? Can you? Can you persuade a crit fail?\nLAURA: Can you persuade the DM?\nASHLEY: Wait, is it a fail?\nASHLEY: It is a one?","response":"DM: Okay, so it was a one–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It was a one.\nLIAM: That's a one face.\nLIAM: That's a one face.","response":"DM: I will say, Pike, roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: d20!\nLAURA: Come on, come on, d20.\nASHLEY: Perception?\nLIAM: Yes, d20. Uh, that's a half a d20.\nASHLEY: 14?\nLAURA: (soft, high voice) No, no… yes, 14.\nSAM: I don't know.\nLAURA: I'll stop.","response":"DM: Unfortunately, you're not quite perceptive enough to notice Scanlan's not quite so quiet walking away, as you're distracted by the surroundings and the circumstance locally. You continue up with the twins, absentmindedly humming to yourself."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (sings softly)","response":"DM: The twins, being used to your humming, for some reason it doesn't connect. You make your way up to the spire. At about 15, 20 feet out, you notice the coloration is different, because it is completely coated in what looks like dried blood of some kind."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Fuck.\nLAURA: (gasps) Oh god.","response":"DM: And immediately to the right of it, along the ground–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: So grossed out.","response":"DM: –currently your vision is obscured by another, large kind of twisted stalactite, but there appears to be an arm and a whole bunch more dried blood across the ground, just out of view."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) Stop! Can we stop? Can we stop?","response":"DM: You can stop."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: An arm?\nLAURA: Scanlan. Shh.\nSAM: What? What?\nLIAM: I'm going to see if I can see anything in the area that has done this recently.\nLAURA: Is the arm attached to whatever did–","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Investigation check?\nLAURA: –Is the arm part of a dead thing or is it alive?","response":"DM: It's on the ground."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure whatever it is, it's dead.\nLIAM: Seven.","response":"DM: Seven?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I check it out as well? I mean, I'm there, I might as well.","response":"DM: You can also attempt to make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Clever. There you go.\nLAURA: Wait, I'm doing advantage, too, just in case. Okay, that one's better.\nLIAM: Oh, I can get advantage?\nSAM: You get advantage on investigation?\nLAURA: No, I got it because I'm fucking in my favored terrain.\nLAURA: 21.\nMARISHA: You walk up in this terrain.","response":"DM: The state of the blood that you see around seems to indicate that this has transpired over some time. You're guessing probably within a few days, if not a week, since this happened."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm picking up one of the arms–\nLAURA: (Gasps)\nLIAM: –to bring back to the group.","response":"DM: Okay, so as you walk up towards the arm to grab it, you have more of a view of what's happened. And what you see before you are definitely remnants of some battle long past."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is the skelly pile.","response":"DM: Against these rocky formations there's dried blood everywhere."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Not pretty.","response":"DM: This terrible bloodbath, whatever this event was, it was probably a horrible thing to see. There are pieces of duergar flung about. And I say pieces - the only reason you know duergar were there is because occasionally you see part of a head, or part of a foot. And you recognize the ashy skin from the areas that aren't currently caked with its own gore."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (gagging sounds)","response":"DM: From what you can tell, because of your investigation check, the remains are torn apart by no blade. There's no cuts, there's no clean wounds. They're either pulled apart by force–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: –like, arms and limbs were wrenched from the body just out of sheer power."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Like a Wookiee.","response":"DM: Or there appears to be some sort of gnawing, some chewing, like toothy fangs, sharp teeth have partially eaten portions of these bodies."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is the work of a beaver.\nLAURA: Yes, definitely, a very large beaver.\nORION: A busy beaver.\nSAM: I think it's suicide.\nLAURA: Based on tracking and everything and insight, can we tell if that creature is anywhere nearby? Or if it's gone?\nORION: I think it might be foul play, actually.","response":"DM: From what you can tell–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It happened in the past.","response":"DM: –Yeah, it happened quite some time ago. Looking at the tracks, you can see duergar feet, you can see other creatures that resemble those hook horrors that you encountered earlier during the lava pool. However, there's a series of tracks that you haven't seen. Well, there is very erratic footsteps that look human size, but they seem to be placed randomly, like one foot here, one foot here, one foot here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) It's that big creature that - it was like one of those things that that thing put together, like–","response":"DM: And you see what seem like strange strikes through the sand, like someone had been dragged very quickly in a very localized spot, scattered all about."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's a human centipede.\nSAM: It is. It's a human centipede.","response":"DM: It's a very strange pattern that you can't really grasp what kind of creature would make it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And it seems like it was here recently, or a while ago?","response":"DM: Best you can tell, the last time it was here was about two or three days ago, to feast on more of the remains."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Human? Human footprints?\nLAURA: Should we get out of here?","response":"DM: Human sized."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Human sized.\nTRAVIS: Or set a trap.\nLAURA: We could try to set a trap, or we could look and see if we can loot anything? Is there anything to loot? Does it look like anything shiny?","response":"DM: Any semblance of armor that belonged to any of these individuals is in such tatters that it's unusable. You do manage to find, across some of the body parts, a couple of blood-soaked gold coin purses."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nMARISHA: Take it.\nLAURA: I like gold.","response":"DM: One of them contains a handful of gems."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh!\nMARISHA: Gems.","response":"DM: Yes, those right there. So you can mark that down, until you get a chance to appraise them."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I don't think we want to tangle with this. What are we trying to prove? Let's just keep trucking.\nSAM: I'm really bad at stealthing, we should go.\nSAM: We should leave.\nSAM: Was I doing that? It's force of habit, I don't - it's like breathing.\nLIAM: Yeah, we're going to go back to the group, I'm going to bring the arm.\nTRAVIS: I take out the cask of ale and pour a little tankard of ale, just because I'm bored.\nASHLEY: Have a sip sip.","response":"DM: Good man. Well done. It's very tasty."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Would anyone else like a sip? Keyleth?","response":"DM: Having been underground for what probably amounts now to four or five days, that little taste of ale on your lips is a very welcoming and very refreshing sensation."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's good shit, right?\nASHLEY: Oh, delicious. Oh no, I'm drunk! Just kidding.\nASHLEY: That was fast! Just kidding.\nLIAM: When we get back to the group, I'm going to toss the arm to Grog.","response":"DM: Grog, you instinctively reach up and catch it. You look down and see what looks like a duergar arm that has been very heavily mangled."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh! Thanks for the hand!\nLIAM: It's a back scratcher.\nORION: That was clever, Grog!\nLAURA: Well, we killed a lot of duergar this time.\nTRAVIS: Don't negative anything. It was a good joke.","response":"DM: It was a good joke. I considered it, but no."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Have mercy!\nORION: That was a good joke.\nLAURA: There's a big centipede-y human, creepy creature that's killed a lot of things and we should probably avoid that at all costs.\nORION: I would agree with that.\nLIAM: If we have to, we will, but–\nTALIESIN: That seems fair.\nLAURA: Can we avoid that and still head left of the keep?","response":"DM: You haven't seen a creature."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, we didn't make it into the - was there a structure that we could have entered?\nLAURA: That's where we're going.\nLIAM & MATT: You're heading towards that structure.\nSAM: Okay. But I mean, where we just were?\nORION: The magma fortress.","response":"DM: Where you just were? No, there's just all these giant rocky spires jutting out of the ground."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Spike coated in dried blood.\nSAM: They didn't have doors in them?\nLAURA: Should we probably have looked for like a nest?","response":"DM: There were no doors."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, good. I'm looking for a door!\nLIAM: No, we should just keep going. If we're going to run into it, we're going to run into it. Let's not find it.\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: It appears like there was, at one point in time, some very intense seismic activity in this area that created this cavern, and whatever is the source of a lot of this perpetually flowing, molten rock. That's why the entire terrain here is so dangerous and uninviting, is because of the sheer force that went into its creation."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.\nLAURA: So we should just keep freaking being careful and keep going towards the giant thing.\nSAM: Okay. Let's go.\nASHLEY: Keep trucking on.\nSAM: Pike, I have this weird feeling, like you wanted to make out with me. Is that something that happened? Am I dreaming?\nASHLEY: Well, you just, you know, you weren't paying attention.\nSAM: Really?\nLAURA: And that makes you want to make out with him?\nASHLEY: No, I think you were moving along to try to go stealth and sometimes you should just stay put and see what happens.\nORION: Well said, cleric!\nLIAM: That was the most adorable diss in history.\nTALIESIN: That was cold.\nORION: Yet inviting.","response":"DM: A small hit to Scanlan's morale, but the party marches on."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You lose an inspiration die.\nTRAVIS: Disadvantage on whatever roll.\nSAM: I deserved it, I deserved it.\nLIAM: Okay, twins in front, here we go.\nLAURA: Let's keep going.","response":"DM: Twins in front. You guys continue to push forward. For the sake of the length of this journey, I'm going to have the party go ahead and roll a communal stealth check once more."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I still have Pass Without A Trace up.\nTALIESIN: Oh, for the love of god.\nMARISHA: Which gives everyone a plus 10.\nLAURA: Oh, really?!","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Percy! Don't bang the guns together.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, that happened too.\nORION: 24.","response":"DM: 24?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 19.\nLIAM: We all have plus 10?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And this is plus 10, already?\nSAM: Yes.\nTALIESIN: I rolled a one.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"(all groan)\nLAURA: Oh, Percy!\nSAM: I kiss Percy!\nTALIESIN: What?! Ah!\nSAM: I don't know! I thought it might help.\nORION: You have to use the tongue, Scanlan.\nMARISHA: 23.\nSAM: Is that bubblegum?","response":"DM: Okay. Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 26.\nASHLEY: Three.\nTALIESIN: I have a habit.\nLAURA: (gasps) You have a plus 10.\nASHLEY: Oh! I get to do plus 10 bonus to that?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 13!\nLAURA: 30.\nMARISHA: Three failures?\nLIAM: 32.","response":"DM: Okay, good."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (relieved) Ah!","response":"DM: More than half you guys succeeded. That bit is key. A one is two failures."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!\nASHLEY: I'm not stealthy, man.\nMARISHA: A one is two failures?","response":"DM: A one is considered two failures for this challenge. Pushing forward–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Now you roll well.","response":"DM: –you manage to stop Percy and find out the root of this audio problem. Pushing forward, you manage to make your way about a quarter mile on the outskirts of this cluster of buildings. Curving far left, you're just managing to keep out of the city proper and move straight towards the very back wall of this cavern, which is buttressed against -  what this fortress is built against. So you're circumventing the city to go straight to this fortress. As you're moving, about a quarter mile from the stronghold, Vex, you pick up a strange person standing maybe about 50, 60 feet ahead of you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Just a person?","response":"DM: Just a person, it looks like."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can they see us? Does it look like they can see us?","response":"DM: You take a moment, keeping an eye out, and the person isn't moving. Just standing right there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) So. There's a person standing right there.\nMARISHA: (whispering) What?\nLAURA: (whispering) A person. He's just standing there.","response":"DM: It's too dark to make out any details, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No. Hmm.\nSAM: Could be good, could be bad. We have no idea.\nLIAM: Can I see him now that she's pointed him out to me?\nSAM: I can hold him. Might piss him off.\nTRAVIS: At least do the hold.","response":"DM: You can see it. And there is a humanoid, standing on its own."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It doesn't seem to be moving, though.\nLAURA: Maybe it's a scarecrow?\nLIAM: Maybe it's a statue.\nLAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean.\nTRAVIS: A statue?\nSAM: Want me to go check it out?\nLIAM: No! I don't!\nLAURA: Can't you go invisible?\nSAM: Yes, I can go invisible.\nLAURA: Go invisible and check it out.\nSAM: I polymorph and turn into a fly and I buzz over.\nMARISHA: Oh, yay! That's fun.\nLIAM: Good job, gnome nuts.\nLAURA: Oh no, if he's magic, he's going to know.","response":"DM: You approach this individual and notice it is unmoving and is of a singular, solid color."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) It's a statue.","response":"DM: What looks to be what is an illithid or a mind flayer is currently locked in some sort of reactionary position, but is completely turned to stone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!\nMARISHA: Oh shit.\nSAM: Like a Medusa type of a thing?\nLIAM: We faced basilisks once and they did this to Vex'ahlia.\nTRAVIS: We've got basilisk eggs.\nMARISHA: There's a lot of things that can do this, actually, to be fair.\nLAURA: We do have basilisk eggs in the bag of holding.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we've got eight of them. Maybe we should crack one on statue guy.\nSAM: I buzz back to the group. (buzzing)\nLAURA: Oh, what's that? Oh, it's Scanlan.\nSAM: I kind of fuck with Tiberius's ear a little bit.\nORION: Oh, Scanlan, stop it!\nSAM: And I turn back.\nTRAVIS: Well, what did you see?\nLAURA: What was it?\nSAM: A crazy statue of a crazy illithid.\nLIAM: That's crazy.\nLAURA: Can we look at Clarota and say: “Do you know anything about this?”","response":"DM: Clarota kind of thinks for a second and goes: (breathy, raspy voice) “As far as I've noticed, occasionally these patrols do walk with a lizard creature that has this ability. It's generally used as a threatening device or a guardian amongst the city.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh! So the duergar–\nLAURA: Have basilisks.\nMARISHA: –have this as, like, their pets?","response":"DM: “A trained beast, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Why do you suppose they used it on one of their own?","response":"DM: “I can only imagine maybe this transpired before the union and is left as a warning.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So it's a duergar pet?\nLAURA: Do we remember how to take care of basilisks? Like, do we not look at them, is that how they don't–\nLIAM: Don't look at them. That's correct.\nLAURA: Don't look them in the eye? Or don't look at their face?\nLIAM: Yes, that's it. It's a vision thing.\nLAURA: Yes?\nTALIESIN: Yes, I believe it's vision based.\nLAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: This would be a nature check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Double check.","response":"DM: For anyone who wishes to make one."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'll do that.\nTRAVIS: Me too.\nTALIESIN: 23. Natural 20.\nLAURA: Oh, well, never mind. He's got it.\nORION: Very good, yay!\nMARISHA: Oh, well, I'll stop there.\nTRAVIS: Just go ahead and dunk on everybody, why don't you?","response":"DM: Natural 20. Essentially it is a sight-based circumstance."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's entirely visual. They have to catch your gaze and then that is how they can turn you into stone. Otherwise, as long as you don't catch their gaze, you'll be fine.\nTRAVIS: So, look them in the eye? Got it.\nTALIESIN: Yes! Very helpful.\nTRAVIS: Let's go.\nMARISHA: Poor basilisks. Can never make eye contact.\nSAM: We're going on?\nTRAVIS: Yeah!\nLAURA: Yeah, let's keep going.","response":"DM: As you guys push forward, Clarota lags behind a little bit to inspect the statue. Kind of looks it over for a second–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Did you know him?","response":"DM: (low, breathy voice) “Uh…”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Dave.\nORION: I don't think his name was Dave, Scanlan.","response":"DM: He takes a moment to look over and you can see his eyes close slightly for a second. (raspy, breathy voice) “Aye, we've met. Not the kindest of my people, but, nevertheless, should all this pass, I would like to, maybe, release him from this stony prison.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So you know how to do that?","response":"DM: “I know not, but it can be done. I've seen it.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Didn't we do that?\nORION: Yes.\nLAURA: Didn't we have to do that?\nLIAM: We sprinkled some of its blood on your eyes, if I remember correctly.\nORION: Yes!\nLAURA: I turned to stone?","response":"DM: You did."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You did. I was very sad.\nORION: Yes, that's correct. We used the blood of the creature.\nLAURA: I remember, I remember. Yeah, I remember that.","response":"DM: Essentially, there is a liquid that can be distilled from the basilisk blood."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: We don't have any more of that.","response":"DM: You do not."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. So we'll be careful.\nTRAVIS: Dragon blood for fucking days.\nLIAM: We also don't know if it's a basilisk.\nSAM: Should we move this statue off to a safe place, inside or anything?\nLAURA: Nah, fuck it.\nSAM: It's fine here, it's fine.\nLIAM: No, it's heavy.\nLAURA: Let's just keep going.\nMARISHA: It's been there for a while.\nTALIESIN: Let's not give anybody any indication we've been here.\nLAURA: It's got bat poo on it, let's keep going.\nSAM: Okay.","response":"DM: As you guys press forward, about another 20 or so minutes, you now have a much better view  of the left side of Emberhold proper. And you can see the large magma fall that is pouring over the top of the fortress's second story and completely encompasses that side. It splits and divides towards the center - a larger fall towards the front of the fortress and a thinner one towards the very back."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) Thin one! Thin one!\nTRAVIS: Yeah, let's go towards the door.\nLAURA: Yeah! Creepy, creepy, creepy towards the thin one.\nLIAM: The creeps are creeping.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're in stealth, still, or…?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we're all stealthed.","response":"DM: For you, it'd be stealth. Yeah, you guys are all stealthed still."}

Well, I said I wanted to go back and look.\nLAURA: Oh.\nLIAM: Right, I want to see if I can tell if anything - I know this all looks natural, but perhaps something is fashioned to look such. I want to see if I can figure that out.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigate check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Uh, lalalala. 18.","response":"DM: 18? Best that you can find, looking around, you cannot see anything before you, any sort of mechanism, any sort of any button, any sort of lever, or additional doorway. It's just a solid wall, with the two magma flows."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right, right, right. Can I come up and look and see if I can see any tracking? If there's any footprints around a certain area around this.\nLIAM: See if you can find a false door or something.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: Do it. Do it.\nMARISHA: Wait, I thought it was behind–\nLIAM: No!\nLAURA: It's okay, no, no, no! I get an advantage.\nLIAM: It was a one.\nLAURA: Shush.\nLAURA: Is it investigation?\nLIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: 22.\nLAURA: (gasps, sighs)","response":"DM: Ah, the chicken has arrived."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Does it look like it's safe to bring everybody up here or does it seem like anything's around that could see us? Anything looking from above?","response":"DM: You glance up and you can see there are two duergar perched up on the edge of the first floor, right on the parapet. You can see there's all this jagged, obsidian stone, almost teeth, sticking out of the very top edge of the wall. And you see the patrols just walking, keeping an eye out. They have crossbows on their arms. A couple of others just have javelins at the side. And they're just doing slow patrols."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nSAM: We need to 007–\nLAURA: We're going to have to be super–\nSAM: We're going to have to 007 sniper them out.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: I can handle this, I think.\nLAURA: You can?\nMARISHA: I think I can get us into that trap door.\nSAM: I think you're right.\nLAURA: Do you have something that can pull it towards you?\nSAM: No no no, can you redirect the magma flow around that bulge with your - can't you, move rocks or–\nMARISHA: I can.\nSAM: So you can create a like a little lip for it to go around?\nLAURA: Ooh…\nMARISHA: I was thinking I could either do - that's not a bad idea, or I could - That's actually not a bad idea.\nMARISHA: Or I could, or I was thinking I could cool off the magma and we could break it.\nLAURA: Oh yeah, maybe you can move it away, and then cool it.\nLIAM: That sounds kind of noisy.\nMARISHA: Well…\nSAM: First we've got to take care of the guys on the roof. Are they back with us, or are they still stealthing in front?","response":"DM: They're still stealthing in front, and you guys have come back to the group?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, I guess we came back to the group and told them about what's going on.\nSAM: Okay. We can - me and Pike - can take out the guys on the roof.\nLAURA: Oh really?\nTRAVIS: Yeah! Do it!\nASHLEY: You want to give it a go?\nLAURA: Wait, but he's got sneak attack.\nLIAM: Yeah, I'm thinking that Keyleth should–\nLAURA: Yeah but we could–\nSAM: Yeah, but they're a good 200 feet up.\nLIAM: –bird out and drop me.\nLAURA: If Keyleth can bird up or you could go over on the flying carpet or something.\nSAM: I can take Pike and we can do it.\nLAURA: Oh my god.\nMARISHA: Are they are they unable to be shot out? Can you not arrow them out?\nLAURA: I can try to arrow them out too.\nMARISHA: How high are they?\nLIAM: She can get a hit or two, but the chances that she could take them both out at once…\nLAURA: Maybe you should go up and I'll arrow one and you…\nTRAVIS: Why don't you let the little people have some fun?\nMARISHA: I'm just afraid if you go up there, that you're going to alarm yourself to other people.\nTALIESIN: How loud is it down there? Is the lava flow making noise?","response":"DM: Very subtle pops and hisses, but other than that it's pretty quiet."}

Thank you David Norris for the chicken!"}

What are you doing?"}

You just gotta shove them.\nLAURA: Yeah, they'll fall in the lava pit, just shove them off the side.\nSAM: Maybe. I don't know where they're going to fall.\nLAURA: Well, just do it.\nMARISHA: Well, if they miss they miss the lava pit, we've got Grog.\nORION: Can I just say right now–\nLAURA: Just be ready to let us know if you need help.\nORION: –I'm going to be reading this book.\nMARISHA: Eagle form.\nLIAM: I'm hanging by Keyleth in case shit goes south.\nLAURA: Oh my god this is so stupid.\nLIAM: Then we're going up, right?\nMARISHA: Jump on my back.\nSAM: What you got, Pike?\nLIAM: Yeah, girl.\nLAURA: Give me the flying carpet just in case I need to fly.\nMARISHA: Or I can give you a ride.\nSAM: I can get you up there. What can you do when we're up there?\nASHLEY: There's something I've been wanting to do.\nSAM: Yeah!\nTRAVIS: What do you say?\nORION: Oh my word, this is fascinating!\nLAURA: We're doing it!\nTRAVIS: But what do you say to get the magic carpet?\nLAURA: Please can I have the magic carpet?\nSAM: I'm going to just look at the guard's pattern of movement. Are they staying in position, or are they walking around? Are they talking to each other at all?\nTRAVIS: Ooh, good question.","response":"DM: As you watch, you take a moment, still from the far back position, watch the two up there come together; they chat for a second, then a third one appears."}

I'm a-coming up there to kill some - some things.\nTRAVIS: Do you have any climbing gear or anything?\nASHLEY: I have a grappling hook.\nLIAM: The ocean has changed you.\nLAURA: Oh my god.

Carpet?\nSAM: No.\nLAURA: Eagle.\nLIAM: What?\nTRAVIS: You're climbing that shit, aren't you?\nSAM: I can get there like that. We're good.\nTRAVIS: Cliffhanger. Beautiful.\nLIAM: Do it, Tom Cruise.\nASHLEY: Not really, but let's just wing it!\nSAM: I'm going to try to knock them both off in one blow, but if I miss, you gotta take one.\nLAURA: You can charge them off if you want.\nTRAVIS: You've got a morningstar.\nSAM: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Morningstar to the taint.\nSAM: Grog, you ready to kill?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, oh yeah!\nLAURA: Be really quiet while you're fighting, try to take them out before they–\nTALIESIN: This is awesome and nothing is going to go wrong.\nMARISHA: Why are we using the gnomes to throw people over?\nORION: I can't believe how they wrote this.\nSAM: We're little people! You know why? Because I need someone with me and I can only take her, because that's the only other one who will fit through the Dimension Door with me.\nLAURA: Go!\nASHLEY: The Dimension Door?\nSAM: Yes, we're going to go through a Dimension Door. I can take one person of my height or smaller.\nSAM: So I will take Pike.\nLIAM: Portal, motherfucker!","response":"DM: You reach over and hold on to Pike gently, give her a little wink.

You feel the sudden rush of air and the surrounding atmosphere of you goes from that uncomfortable warmth to a sudden freezing cold as your vision goes black and all you can see is Scanlan looking at you with this heightened grin as he's muttering these arcane incantations under his breath. An instant later, you guys are both standing at the top of the wall, with both of the duergar, one kind of facing away, one looking really surprised at the fact that you guys both appeared there. You have a surprise round. What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I cast Thunderwave and blast out from where I'm standing between them, 15 feet in either direction.\nLAURA: (whispering) That's so loud!\nMARISHA: Isn't that loud?\nSAM: So, 10 feet and 10 feet away from me.","response":"DM: Okay. What's your save?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Uh, 19.\nLIAM: But a quiet Thunderwave, right?\nLAURA: A really quiet Thunderwave.\nORION: Thunderclap is loud. Thunderwave is different.\nLAURA: Oh, okay.\nMARISHA: But I'm pretty sure it's still thunder.","response":"DM: Thunderwave, looking it up real fast just to make sure of the situation."}

{"prompt":"SAM: I don't think it's loud.\nLIAM: We're total fake geeks, all of us.\nTALIESIN: Such fake geeks.\nSAM: Oh no - well, it's a wave of thunderous force, but it doesn't say sound. It just says thunderous force.","response":"DM: I would say thunderous force isn't a thunderclap,but it will make some noise."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, fine.","response":"DM: So keep that in mind."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Keyleth, fly up and cast Pass Without Trace on them.","response":"DM: So, as you guys appear, you release Pike, you bring your arms up and slam your arms in a downward motion. As you do, there is a dull flash of light and a (boom noise) burst sound emanates from you."}

Come on!\nASHLEY: It was.\nSAM: Just a little something something?\nASHLEY: Let's just–\nMARISHA: So sexy.","response":"DM: As this is happening, both of the duergar come plummeting off the side of the wall."}

He took some damage and is like (pained gasps) trying to get back up. He fell hard on one arm. The other one that's further away from the magma, the one that saw you, managed to reduce his damage a little bit because it was aware at least you were there."}

Before he gets a chance to, you cleave off one arm and send the axe right into the center of his torso, silencing him in an instant. He slightly spreads at the wound.

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I tilt him towards the pillar to spray the pillar with his gore. Look, I can make one too! Ha ha!\nMARISHA: I run across to the other one and Thorn Whip him from across the lava pool.","response":"DM: You have to jump over the lava to do that because he's on the side you guys are on."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh. Well then, is there anyone on the other side?\nASHLEY: Is he already dying, or no? He's in the lava?\nMARISHA: He's on the same side as me?","response":"DM: He's on the same side as you."}

That's some dark shit!\nMARISHA: Oh, I thought it was Vex and Vax. Every time I get confused.\nASHLEY: Oh my god. Remember you killed that kid one time?\nLIAM: Two and a half years in and Keyleth has just learned our names.\nMARISHA: I get them confused.\nSAM: I do too. All the time.\nSEVERAL: All the time.\nMARISHA: See, no one else has any idea!\nORION: I have your names written down!\nLIAM: I'm Vex, okay? It's simple!\nSAM: No, no! That is not true!\nLAURA: No, no, don't do that. He's lying.","response":"DM: So, as the terrible blood spray occurs across the nearby pillar on Grog's side, the other duergar is getting up with his crossbow, trying to get it ready.

{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh! Yes!","response":"DM: So, as the duergar is getting up, he goes - (grunt) You just run up and - boom! And he falls back - (hissing SFX) (screams) - and starts giving a horrible, painful scream as he's essentially flailing in the magma, melting."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Someone shoot him in the mouth.\nMARISHA: I say, shh! Shh! Shh! And I wind down to push him under the lava!\nASHLEY: Oh, this is brutal!\nORION: That's not what it's called.","response":"DM: Okay. So, as he's screaming your Wind Wall shoves him further under the magma as he's screaming, cooling the magma around him as the rock (cracking SFX) cracks around him, turning into black rock–"}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Run! Or can you turn yourselves into duergar?\nSAM: Is there a door or something?","response":"DM: Not from your current position, no. You're just on a five foot ledge of the second story."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Of the fortress. Oh, it's not a standalone tower. It's part of a larger wall.\nASHLEY: How far of a jump down is it?","response":"DM: It's about 25 feet."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, what's happening?\nASHLEY: We could try to stay and fight?\nLIAM: Turn into a duergar! (cawing sounds)\nLAURA: Turn into a duergar! Act like you're a duergar!

So you grab her, (magic SFX) back down to the bottom."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Cast that shit.","response":"DM: They reappear at the bottom."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Are you done?\nMARISHA: Okay, I cast Wall of Stone, but right over top of where I see that lip. But I don't want to bring it out far. Just like, halfsies.\nMARISHA: Just the tip.\nASHLEY: Does it stop the magma?","response":"DM: As you guys appear at the bottom–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So it goes like magma flow, here's the wall, I want it to go - (grinding noise)","response":"DM: –you guys hear footprints along the wall. They don't seem to have seen you yet. At which point there's this (grinding and thump sounds) sound of shifting rock. A giant stone wall juts out the side of the fortress right where the lava pool was pouring over the side. As it does, the lava pools on top of the wall and is offset, leaving a small gap where you guys can try to squeeze through. You can see, right underneath where it was, there is a stone doorway. It does not appear to have a handle or anything, it's just a stone door."}
{"prompt":"SAM: How do we get in?\nLIAM: Tiberius, fly up there quick.\nORION: What?\nLIAM: Stop eating chicken and fly up to that door.\nORION: Oh.\nASHLEY: Where did you get that chicken?\nORION: What's going on?\nLIAM: There's a magic doorway up there, I don't see any handles or anything.","response":"DM: It's right underneath the lava."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, it's on the ground?","response":"DM: Basically she put the stone wall out. It pours off."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's right there! What are you talking about?\nLIAM: I walk up to it and take a look.\nLAURA: Oh yeah, that was good. Maybe Grog can push it!\nORION: I'm going to do an Arcana check.\nLIAM: Do I have advantage?","response":"DM: Uh, no."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can Grog push it?\nTRAVIS: No, he's doing an arcana check.\nSAM: Grog, just kill it!\nORION: 22.","response":"DM: 22? As you guys are inspecting this, in the time you've taken to do this, both the duergar up on top have seen you, and are both taking shots at you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh shit.\nTALIESIN: I was waiting for that anyways so, I'm going to–\nMARISHA: He was waiting.","response":"DM: As they appear on the top, you guys who have your arrow and gun at the ready, both take a shot then they get a retribution shot."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Keyleth!\nMARISHA: What?\nLIAM: Let's go up!\nMARISHA: Go up?\nLIAM: Up to them, quick.\nMARISHA: I want see how they fare.\nLIAM: That's going to be about six seconds.","response":"DM: The door is not magical. It is a mechanism of some kind."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I rolled a 65.\nLIAM: 65? Holy shit you're a deity!\nLAURA: I'm amazing!\nORION: Vax. Pay attention, the door mechanical, it is not magical. That's how we open it.\nLAURA: 25.","response":"DM: 25. Percy? And you get two attacks each. So - (zipping SFX)"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I hit a 23.","response":"DM: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll second attack."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, roll damage.","response":"DM: Well, roll both attacks first."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 18 for the second one.","response":"DM: Hits as well."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have to reload with my second attack.","response":"DM: Oh right. Is this with the Bad News?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I've got the big gun out.","response":"DM: You've got the Bad News out. Okay then, yeah. So you fire and then reload. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm using my fire bow.","response":"DM: You're using the fire bowstring. As you nock your first arrow, (swoosh sound) it bursts into flame as it hits your fingers."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh my god.\nMARISHA: (dejected groan)\nTALIESIN: Seven damage.","response":"DM: Seven damage? Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm so embarrassed.","response":"DM: I'm sorry."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (gunshot sound) You got me right in the ear.\nLAURA: 20 damage on the first attack.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Come on, Vex.\nLAURA: 13 on the second.","response":"DM: Okay, as both are going up with their crossbows ready to go, first one, Bad News - (gunshot sound) - with a cacophonous echoing gunshot that within this cavern, definitely carries some sound to it. And to some degree, suprise may be a little harder to find going forward."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: They were ready to start shooting at us.","response":"DM: However, the shot hits the guy in the shoulder, knocks him off balance for a second. Not enough of a wound to prevent his next action. You, however, place one arrow into the other guy's shoulder. He's dropped the crossbow. As he goes to reach for his other weapon, the other one just, right at the bottom of his throat, out the back of his head, and he just drops below the wall."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Awesome.","response":"DM: The other one does get a crossbow shot off at you, Percy. That is a 23 versus armor class."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That hits.","response":"DM: You take nine points of piercing damage. As the bolt just streaks you across the front of your torso. Passes through, thankfully, but you do feel there is a wound that's slowly turning warmer beneath your armor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I shoot at the other one?","response":"DM: That's been the round. Now, you guys have been inspecting the door. The door is not magical. There is some sort of contraption that opens it from the inside."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm getting my picks out, seeing if I can figure out some way to–","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a check with your thieves' tools."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 29.","response":"DM: A 29. You take a second and you find that the contraption that holds this door in place definitely is on the other side. It's a series of winches and a chain pull. You find that there is one slight gap where you manage to hook one of the chains, pull it out ever so slightly, and you know with a strong yank from a strong person, you could probably pull it out from the outside."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Grog!\nTRAVIS: Sounds like we need a strong person.\nLIAM: So this is the part where I ask Grog over to pull. Grog, grab this–\nASHLEY: I'll do it! I'll do it.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, me and Pike are on this.\nASHLEY: I'll assist.","response":"DM: Grog, you reach over and grab the chain, and Pike grabs onto the back of you and you both pull."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Give it a good heave-ho.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a strength check with advantage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh yeah, 23.","response":"DM: 23. As you pull, you hear the grinding of this chain against the stone, (cracking SFX) and you can see the actual door begin to rise upward this way."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's a Delorean.","response":"DM: Essentially. When it opens up, it moves the magma out of the way. That's how this construct is used as an exit. It's what I mentioned before. This is supposed to be an exit for the royal individuals of the stronghold. It only opens part way, however, because the stone wall currently blocks the rest of its movement. However, you can still move through it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We can't leave this duergar behind though, we gotta take him out.","response":"DM: Yes, there is one duergar still there. So that's been all of your guys' actions. We're bringing it back. Pike, you haven't gone yet."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: Keyleth you've gone, so the only one left to take an action is–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Tiberius, have you gone?","response":"DM: Yeah, he checked the doorway."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh right.\nASHLEY: Where's he at?","response":"DM: He's up on top of the wall, about 25 feet from you."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I want to create a spiritual weapon, like a poisonous lasso, and (whiff SFX) and then put him down into the lava.","response":"DM: Huh. Sure."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A lariat of truth?\nTRAVIS: That's awesome.","response":"DM: So using your spiritual weapon, you take a moment, you grasp your Sarenrae holy symbol around your neck, and as you pull your hand away from the symbol you see this glowing celestial rope extends out of nowhere. You begin to spin your fingers, and on its own, it begins to swirl and swirl. You then throw your hand forward and on its own, it cascades upward toward the edge of the wall. Go ahead and roll an attack roll."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: An attack roll? Which is?","response":"DM: Using your spell modifier as the attack bonus."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 10.\nSAM: Ooh. That ain't gonna do it.","response":"DM: Total of 10?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I think so.","response":"DM: What'd you roll?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I rolled a two, and then I have a plus eight.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That ain't no good.\nLIAM: It was a good idea though.\nLAURA: It was such a good idea.","response":"DM: The celestial lasso, which you don't get the feeling poison is something you could really muster based on your deity's central good–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I was just kidding! I was just getting a little crazy with ideas.","response":"DM: I like it. However, as it heads over the wall, you see it does not find purchase on the duergar. It instead finds purchase on part of the wall."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Fuck.\nTRAVIS: Poisoning the wall effectively.","response":"DM: Yes, it is now a poisoned property."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It was going to be pretty cool.\nLIAM: Remember it for the future though.","response":"DM: That brings us to the top of the round order. I believe at the top we have–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Mister Me?","response":"DM: Yes, Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Boy, oh boy. We're still trying to get that fucker up on the roof right?\nLIAM: Yes, he's going to run and tell people.\nSAM: I've got almost nothing. So I'll just - can I summon an Unseen Servant to push him?\nMARISHA: Oh yeah, that's a good idea.","response":"DM: We can give it a shot."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Roll high. Roll really high.\nSAM: I don't have any ranged weapons.\nLAURA: Natural 20!","response":"DM: So you conjure Unseen Servant. Mark off your spell use."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I look up and go, “Ooh, It's Monty's cousin.”","response":"DM: You see a slight shimmer of ethereal energy behind the duergar. It's going to attempt to shove him. It isn't, unfortunately, on its own, extremely strong. It's mainly meant as an aide. However, it is possible. Go ahead and make an athletics check. Not your athletics, just make a d20 roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Just a normal athletics.\nLIAM: Come on, 20.\nSAM: Yeah, I mean it's a five, so.\nASHLEY: What's your athletics? We're really rolling well tonight.","response":"DM: You hear a (ting) sound as the duergar's armor is given a hefty slap, but no apparent force is placed upon its body."}
{"prompt":"ORION: A hefty slap.\nSAM: Thank you, Jarvis!\nSAM: But is he confused?","response":"DM: A little bit, but not enough to not be loading his crossbow for a second shot."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Damn it!","response":"DM: Good thinking on that point."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We're a party of seven people just like, “Aw, damn it, you!“\nTALIESIN: Like a cat in a tree, just - (beckoning whistle)\nSAM: And I'm going to just give a little inspiration to Vax. That's Laura, obviously.\nLAURA: Yes, thank you.\nMARISHA: It inverted. That's what I always get mixed.\nLAURA: Nice.\nSAM: (hums Dueling Banjos)","response":"DM: You're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! I attack him.\nMARISHA: Pew pew.\nASHLEY: Pew pew!\nLAURA: It's good.\nLIAM: It's a one.\nMARISHA: Damn it! What is wrong with us?\nTRAVIS: What in the hot and holy shit is happening right now?\nASHLEY: What are we doing?","response":"DM: That's your first attack?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: My first attack is a serious fail. My second attack, though, is a 25.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's pretty cool.","response":"DM: So the first one you pull back, and as you pull back the actual arrow snaps."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You almost shot me!\nLAURA: Ow, that hurt my arm so bad.","response":"DM: Yeah, you're gonna have a little rash there probably tomorrow."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Great. eight.\nLAURA: (nervously) Haha.","response":"DM: It's getting its shot at you. That is a 17 versus armor class."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nope.","response":"DM: Nope?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nope.","response":"DM: You manage to just dodge out of the way. You hear it whiz past your ear. That brings us to Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll take one more shot at him.\nLIAM: Redemption, Percy.\nTRAVIS: Come on, buddy.\nSAM: Kill this guy.\nASHLEY: Get it.\nSAM: He's lasted longer than most of the people we fight.\nTALIESIN: 18?","response":"DM: 18 hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Come on die.\nTRAVIS: Come on, Percy.\nLIAM: Right in the belly button.\nMARISHA: Oh, that's nice. That's pretty.\nTALIESIN: That's 25 points of damage.\nTRAVIS: Thank you!\nLAURA: Yes!","response":"DM: With a second (click), you pull out one of your custom made, nasty looking bullets, load it back into Bad News. You pull it back, aim up, and fire. And once again, you guys are seeing this weapon up close again. With each fire, it takes all of his physical body to not get blown off his feet with each time it fires."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's badass, Percy.","response":"DM: (thunder crack) A plume of white and ash-like smoke comes shooting out the side of the weapon. Nearby, you almost have to close your ears instinctually from the loudness of the shot. However, the duergar at the top of the wall, you see where his head once was just (wet impact SFX) across the wall behind it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I love Bad News.\nTALIESIN: Let's move quickly.\nLAURA: Let's get in the door.\nSAM: I think they heard us.\nORION: I go in the door.\nTALIESIN: Going in the door.\nLAURA: We all go in the door.","response":"DM: All of you have made your way into the doorway."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can Trinket fit? Trinket can fit.","response":"DM: Trinket can fit with you, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just barely.\nASHLEY: Just bear-ly.\nLIAM: It's like Winnie the Pooh, in the–\nLAURA: If Grog can fit, Trinket can fit.\nTALIESIN: It's the one you don't suit.\nTRAVIS: Oh no, we can't see anything.","response":"DM: You guys make your way into this tiny little room–"}
{"prompt":"ALL: Whoa!","response":"DM: You're all very crammed in, to get anywhere."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Into this (high voice) teeny-tiny little room.\nLIAM: Feels like an intermission room.\nLAURA: Oh. A bathroom break room?\nLIAM: Yes. We could all relieve ourselves in this room.","response":"DM: You guys all slowly push into this storage room. It's very musty. It hasn't seen use in quite a while. In fact, you can see a little bit of mold is growing  on the side of one of the barrels in the corner."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ooh, dank.","response":"DM: There is a doorway that is closed on the opposite side of this wall, and from what you can see, there is a stairway that curves upwards to the second floor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh!\nSAM: Guys, I'm sensing a lot of purple and brown construction paper here.\nORION: I am as well, Scanlan.\nLIAM: That's your favored terrain, right?\nSAM: It is.\nLAURA: Can we take an intermission break at this moment?","response":"DM: I think as you guys just entered the stronghold, we'll take this as an intermission break. So take a little over 10 minutes. We'll watch the rest of the  videos here again, and we'll return as the party has just entered the Emberhold itself."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Still alive!\nLIAM: Holy hell.\nTALIESIN: Ow.\nMARISHA: Are you okay?\nTALIESIN: I'm fine.","response":"DM: 2d6 damage to Tiberius. So, guys, for those who are keeping up: two things, real fast. We want to thank Jacqueline Lassiter for the awesome food she sent for us."}
{"prompt":"ALL: (words of acclamation and thanks)","response":"DM: Seriously, thank you. A delightful, necessary treat after this game time. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. Also for the 2,150-subscriber mark, we're giving away this autographed photo of the cast."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Autographed photo.","response":"DM: We'll send out to you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's so handsome.\nMARISHA: Who is it going to?","response":"DM: Some lucky person in the chatroom once we hit 2,150."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh. We don't know yet.","response":"DM: Whenever that happens, that will be going to you. So, yes, returning to the game–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Also, we've got these t-shirts. You should want them.","response":"DM: We're going to now look into–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes, let us know if you want them.\nLAURA: We're going to look into that.","response":"DM: We're going to look into possibly finding a way to get these shirts to you guys in the next couple weeks."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Only if you want them, though. This is going to be a lot of work. We don't want to do it unless you really want them.\nORION: We hate doing work.\nTRAVIS: We're voice actors.\nTALIESIN: We're not here to work.\nSAM: Where are we? We were just going in a door.","response":"DM: Indeed. You guys–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on. Yes, they want them.","response":"DM: Cool. I guess that feedback is good. The party had just managed to not-quite-so-stealthily pry their way into the hidden entrance to the outside of the duergar stronghold of Emberhold. They found themselves crammed into a very tiny, essentially a storage room, with a stairway leading up and a closed doorway leading further into the stronghold. So, what is your preference?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think we should go through the door, instead of going up.\nLIAM: I agree.\nLAURA: Because any prisoners are probably going to be kept at a low level.\nTALIESIN: Can we quietly open the door?","response":"DM: Yeah, once inside."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we very stealthily try to open - oh, check for traps!\nLIAM: Yes, I'm going to sniff the door a bit.\nLAURA: (sniffing SFX)\nLIAM: Yeah, that's a 20.","response":"DM: 20? Best you can tell, the door itself is locked, but is not trapped."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, well - (clinking SFX) Okay, thieves' tools out. Oh, that's an easy 30.\nSAM: 30?!","response":"DM: A 30!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 30.\nSAM: Jesus.\nMARISHA: God damn.","response":"DM: Which is good because it's a very, very intricate lock. There is a specific key, a single key that is designed for this lock, that you gather is probably held by King Murghol himself."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: King Myrtle?\nLAURA: Mairgil. Mare - Mairgil?","response":"DM: Mur-ghol."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Marigold.\nSEVERAL: Murghol.\nSAM: And his queen, Durarara.\nMARISHA: Is that how you pronounce her name? Doo-gara-gar?\nLIAM: It's, uh, Ermahgerd?\nALL: Ermahgerd.\nLAURA: Ulara is her name.\nORION: Kuma.\nLAURA: Queen Ulara.\nSAM: Ulara. Uhura.","response":"DM: Yes. Uhura."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Uhura.\nTALIESIN: Kana.","response":"DM: Kumar."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't know! What is her name? Seriously, what is her name, now?\nLAURA: It's Ulara! Ulara.\nSAM: Ulara.\nMARISHA: What is – ?\nSEVERAL: Ulara.\nMARISHA: Ulara. (giggles)","response":"DM: Shh."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Maybe not.\nMARISHA: Uladra. Right?\nLIAM: I'm picking a lock.\nLAURA: Shh. He's picking a lock. Be very quiet.\nLIAM: (clicking SFX)\nLIAM: 'Ey!","response":"DM: Please do that every time you pick a lock. You manage to get the right sequence, and with a slight - (clicking SFX) - clicking sound, (squeak SFX) the door opens slightly on the inside."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.\nLIAM: It was pretty easy.","response":"DM: Leading into what you can see is a hallway, that continues further down to about there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Where is the door? Where is the door that I just picked?","response":"DM: The door that you picked, if you wanted to walk through is right there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's naturally there.\nLAURA: So that other stuff is upstairs.","response":"DM: All of this is on the floor that you're on."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Okay.\nLIAM: I'm going to take six or seven quiet steps forward, stealthily. 19 stealth.\nORION: As he does this, I'm going to pull out my Ioun stone from my pouch, and let it– (whirling SFX)\nTRAVIS: We're all trapped in that room together, right?","response":"DM: You are. Correct."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I fart.\nORION: Oh! Grog! Prestidigitation, and I (whoosh SFX) make a quick wind-gust–","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just circulate it around the room, will you?\nORION: I blew it away! I could blow it right up your nose, Vax! (fluttering SFX)\nTRAVIS: I'm closer to you now than I've ever been before.\nLAURA: I throw up in my mouth just a little bit.\nTALIESIN: Go around the corner and tell us what you see.","response":"DM: Just a little bit."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh. I'm sorry.\nTALIESIN: Take a very quiet peek around the corner.\nTALIESIN: Quietly.","response":"DM: As you peek through, you can get a general idea of what looks to be some sort of an empty storage room. A lot of materials have been moved out of it. It looks like the remnants of stone, things that were used for construction that once were in this room that have been pulled out to build things. Possibly moved as part of the war camp to start building some of the siege weapons that you saw above."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do I hear anything?","response":"DM: Not currently. Roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: Oh, that's good.\nLIAM: That's pretty good. 27.","response":"DM: Listening, you hear footsteps above. You hear very, very faintly through the stonework about 20 feet above you - (thumping SFX) - some footsteps moving above. Apparently there is some level of alert on the second floor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, shit. We should move fast.\nMARISHA: Hmm. I wonder why.\nLIAM: Go figure.\nLAURA: We should get out of the room.\nORION: Yes, Percy, I wonder why.\nLAURA: We start getting out of the room.\nTALIESIN: It's a wonder, looking outside.\nLIAM: I go back to the door and just be like–\nLAURA: (whispering) Come on. Hurry!\nLIAM: So, I want to go further - no doorway, as of yet. Correct?","response":"DM: No doorway here."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: If I go this way–\nLAURA: They're going to start coming down these fricking stairs in this room.","response":"DM: This way? It ends. The hallway comes to an end, with a wall."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well then, I'm going to peek into this door here. This open door.","response":"DM: Here?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No. What's right by the figure?","response":"DM: This is the one you just looked into that had this empty room that–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Thank you, thank you. So, down the one hall.","response":"DM: Down the one hall. Look past here there is a stairway that descends downward."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Down.","response":"DM: Looking down - pardon me. Looking down this hallway, you see what resembles - there's a door to your left that's closed currently, and it splits off into two directions, right and left."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right, I don't even tell anyone. I just start to slink down the steps.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Did he go down?\nLIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: Oh, geez Louise.","response":"DM: Okay. Put Clarota there. You continue down the stairway, and as you slowly move around, you can see down towards the bottom a very faint bit of reddish glow-stone light and a hallway that splits right and left."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) We should go downstairs.\nLIAM: Right and left? I go to the right.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Why don't we just go left?\nLAURA: We're getting bored.","response":"DM: As you look past the right - you guys are all waiting in the room?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You should just storm in.\nLAURA: I get out.\nLIAM: Start banging your weapons together.\nLAURA: No! I come out, because you're taking too long.","response":"DM: Anyone else?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I saunter about.\nASHLEY: I'll head on out there.\nSAM: I go where Pike goes.\nMARISHA: We're just losing all attention span? Is that what's going on? We're just wandering off.\nLAURA: No no no. I said we stay in the area, but I wanted to check on my brother because I feel like he's taking awhile.\nLAURA: And he was just gonna check the doors.","response":"DM: As you move and glance over, you can see there are two duergar stationed on each side of the split hallways. One is a closed doorway to your right, and to the left there's an open doorway that leads into a room."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And that's when I went to the right?","response":"DM: Well, as soon as you went into where the division was, you turned to the right and there were duergar there, and a duergar on the left."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to turn my chin over to the left, and see what I see down there.","response":"DM: There's a second duergar that is currently sitting in armor, weapon to its side. Just occasionally glancing in. You can hear, every now and then, sounds like a moan or a slight whispering gurgle, and the duergar will lean in - “Hey, shut up in there! 'Kay?!”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to go kill this guy.\nLAURA: You don't want to tell us what you found?\nORION: As I notice him going up, I'm going to -\n(click) Vax, what are you doing?\nLIAM: (softly) Uh, I'm killing someone. Hold, please.\nSAM: (humming a Muzak version of “The Girl from Ipanema”)\nORION: Uh, guys, Vax is going to go kill something.\nMARISHA: It's okay. Let him do it by himself. It's what he does best.\nLIAM: I'm going to sneak up on this duergar.","response":"DM: Make a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I worry.\nMARISHA: I know. It's okay.\nLIAM: 19?","response":"DM: 19? Let me go ahead and–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, no! Look at this.","response":"DM: This'll be an interesting–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Like a magician, you just whip it out, Matt.","response":"DM: That's what I'm doing. Trying, at least. There we go."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you want an extra hand?\nTALIESIN: If Mr. Wizard can do it, you can do it.\nSAM: Watch out!\nLAURA: It's that book.","response":"DM: Oh, it is the book, isn't it? Stupid book. As you've made your way here, Vex [sic] you look to the right. There's the duergar here to the left that's shouting into this room here."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do something!","response":"DM: You missed entirely what I was telling you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Will you fucking do something, please?\nLIAM: He's right there on the side. There's one over there, there's one over there. There's two. Oh, shit. Well, we all come slamming down in here.\nSAM: Yeah!\nTRAVIS: No, you're down there.\nLIAM: So I sneak back up and I put a hand on my sister's shoulder, and I give her a little come along motion. And tell everyone else–\nSAM: Don't you need some Grog?\nLIAM: –I mouth “Kima” at everybody, and then pull my sister down.","response":"DM: As you're doing this, you hear footsteps across the way echoing through the hallway, what sounds like a number of other foot patters heading through the halls–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) We should just go down.","response":"DM: –towards the front of the stronghold."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm just pulling Vex down.\nORION: The front? Oh, the front of the front. Not where we're at, right?","response":"DM: Vex and Vax both disappear off to the side, down a hallway."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Before they leave I just tap their shoulders and meditate and grant them Guidance.","response":"DM: Okay, you can give one of them Guidance because it's concentration."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Uh, Vex.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's me.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fuck.\nLAURA: Did you mean to give it to him?\nMARISHA: Yes.\nORION: Brava.\nSAM: The man one.","response":"DM: Vax."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Vax.\nLIAM: So I pull my poison blade out and I pull the keen dagger out. Okay, and I take the keen dagger - so the one on the left is by the door and the one that muttered through the doorway, right?","response":"DM: The one right here."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I give a little fwip, toss in my hand and throw it right at his neck.\nLAURA: At the same time I reach out and I go (arrow SFX).\nLIAM: And the other one, the poison one, toward the other.","response":"DM: Okay and you are?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And I was going to shoot at the other one.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll for this guy here."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That guy. That is a 17 for me.","response":"DM: 17 hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 27.\nLIAM: And then on the other guy, or should I just go ahead and attack?","response":"DM: Go ahead and attack both."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 17. So that's–\nLAURA: And 25 on the same.","response":"DM: Both arrows on the guy on the right?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Let's do both, one on each.","response":"DM: Each? (shooting SFX) You both - (impact SFX) - ?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah!","response":"DM: Okay, cool. Damage on the one on the left? Which is sneak attack because he didn't know you were there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So, 46 with the keen dagger on the guard at the door.\nTALIESIN: Damn.\nLAURA: So I was really useful!","response":"DM: The guy on the left, as he's leaning back, he's getting angry with whoever is in that room. As he turns back to take his post again, (swoosh SFX) (gurgling) he just gurgles, slumps to the ground. As he's slumping, an arrow goes (impact sound) into his stomach."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's like a punctuation.\nLAURA & MATT: Yeah.","response":"DM: Roll damage for the second attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The poison dagger goes (thunk sound). Well, I didn't roll to hit him.","response":"DM: And you are using the poison effect on him?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: 15 on the other guy for me.\nLIAM: That is a 19.","response":"DM: Okay, that hits. Now roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This doesn't get sneak attack?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Because I already used that. I made some noise hitting the first guy. Seven plus the poison.","response":"DM: What is the poison damage?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The poison is DC 15.","response":"DM: He does not make the save, even though he's a duergar."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I go running back up since I've already shot my arrows.","response":"DM: Let me check one thing real fast."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And I figured you've got this.","response":"DM: Check one thing."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: He could just clear this whole place by himself.\nLIAM: Nine points of poison on him.","response":"DM: Okay. So, an arrow (impact SFX) into his chest just as the poison blade makes contact. You can see him (gurgling SFX) double over for a second, but the hardy duergar once-dwarven form seems to shrug off a lot of the poison's impact."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, shit!","response":"DM: He is still dribbling a very heavy amount of deep crimson from his mouth, but he still (gasps) looks over and sees you both in the hallway and goes to reach for his warhammer and turn around towards the door behind him."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I throw an arrow at him?\nLIAM: Do we roll for initiative at this point?","response":"DM: You guys roll for initiative to see who goes first."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I turn to Pike and say, “What the fuck is going on? Where are they?”\nORION: I don't know, but this book, Scanlan, is incredible.\nSAM: I'm sure it is.\nORION: It's all about this, er, an ice thing–\nSAM: I read non-fiction.\nORION: –and these other things.\nASHLEY: Let's head down there. I'm going to head down there.\nLIAM: Careful, clanky.\nASHLEY: Oh.","response":"DM: So the rest of you are heading down there?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I follow Pike down there.\nSAM: I'm going, too.\nLAURA: There are so many prisoners down this way.","response":"DM: Everyone else roll stealth checks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Everybody fucking come down.\nMARISHA: Are we going down?","response":"DM: Stealth checks everyone. You guys both beat him on initiative."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: Roll attacks, both of you, just roll the dice."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Roll the dice.\nORION: Roll the dice.\nASHLEY: 19.\nLIAM: 28.\nASHLEY: Getting a handle on my armor.","response":"DM: Okay. You don't need to roll damage. He has like, two hit points left. You guys pepper him with additional arrows and daggers. The poor guys is like: “Uh, I'm gonna–” (impact SFX, gurgle) He just goes down with this horrible sense of overkill, his body just slumps up against the door, leaning against the wooden door he was guarding."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I say on my earring: “I think we found the prison cells. Get down here.”\nSAM: We're coming.\nORION: I'm assuming they're dead.","response":"DM: Both duergar."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I start to loot the bodies.","response":"DM: Stealth checks?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 16.\nMARISHA: 17.\nTALIESIN: 12.\nSAM: 12.\nTRAVIS: 20.\nASHLEY: 19.\nMARISHA: Woo! We're stealthy bastards.","response":"DM: That was with disadvantage?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I have to roll again?\nLIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: Why?","response":"DM: Because you're in heavy plate armor."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA & LAURA: No!\nALL: (words of encouragement)\nLAURA: That's not bad, that's still not bad.\nASHLEY: I rolled an eight.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Plus what?\nASHLEY: Plus nothing.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (clanking SFX)","response":"DM: You guys, all rush down the stairs (stomping SFX) the clanking of the plate armor as you're going down. The rest of you wince as you notice it, but you make it down anyway."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I should have picked you up.\nMARISHA: I'm actually going to go ahead and throw Guidance on Pike now.\nSAM: Little late, little late.\nTALIESIN: What does Guidance do?\nMARISHA: It gives you a plus on your ability checks. And it gives you a 1d4 plus to your–\n(several talking at once)\nSAM: Do they already knew [sic] we were here? Now they really know.","response":"DM: So, the rest of you have made it down."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Surprise!","response":"DM: In this hallway, there are two dead duergar on the ground. One with a closed door and one with an open door."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, let's go look in the open door. Stealthily.","response":"DM: You glance over into the open door, you can see what appears to be a series of dungeon cells held underneath the stronghold."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Lady Kima?","response":"DM: Within these, you can see there are a number of dwarven captives that are in very, very, very poor health–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I don't care about them.\nLAURA: We need to get them awake.","response":"DM: –that are currently lying down, unfed, gaunt."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are any of them Lady Kima? Because if they're not, they're about to die.\nLAURA: No, they're regular dwarves, they're good people.\nORION: I go inspect them and see what's going on.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'll go in with Tiberius.","response":"DM: Okay, you guys enter. As you look around, there are a series of largely decomposed bodies in a few of these cells. They are people who've just been left to die."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.","response":"DM: One, there are these kind of strange deep underground, rat-like creatures that are feeding on one of them. One of the dwarves is just wheezing in pain (moaning). You can see his stomach is a little distended. The other one is either unconscious, asleep, or dead. You can't tell."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I do a Mass Cure on them?","response":"DM: You can if you'd like."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. I'll do that.\nLIAM: Yes, I was about to say. I'm going to go start inspecting the other door.\nTALIESIN: I'll go with him.\nLAURA: Why don't you unlock the prison cells here?\nMARISHA: Yeah, can you unlock the prison cells?\nLIAM: Oh, sorry.\nLAURA: Can we go in? Can we talk to them?","response":"DM: If you guys want to. So you go through. It's fairly simple over time for you to unlock the cells if you'd like, the two that are in there. There's a difference between healing magic and nutrition. You make them feel physically better for the moment, but their physical form itself is failing."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Just a thought, shouldn't we clear this mess before we let prisoners out?","response":"DM: They need food, they need air, they need to be out of here soon. They're both on the edge of death."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Put them in the bag of holding, Grog.\nMARISHA: I pull out a water.\nORION: I go to the room, I take out my bottle of water..\nMARISHA: I'll do the opposite one.","response":"DM: You guys hear heavy footsteps coming from the stairway you guys just descended from."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I go stand right next to the stairway.\nMARISHA & TALIESIN: In the cells, in the cells.\nLIAM: I pull my sister and we flank. I push her into flanking position to the door.\nLAURA: Oh God, I nock an arrow, notch an arrow?\nORION: Where are they coming from?\nLIAM: The stairs, from where we entered?","response":"DM: What are you guys doing?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I jump in the cells and I pull a dead, decomposing corpse over the top of me.\nLAURA: Eww, Keyleth. All kinds of nastiness.\nTALIESIN: I find a corner of a cell and slowly pull out my gun.\nMARISHA: I'm going savage!\nTALIESIN: I should make sure all the doors are shut, not locked.\nASHLEY: I'm just, you know, preparing.\nMARISHA: Just kicking it, just chilling.\nLAURA: Do we need to move out of the way of the stairs?\nTALIESIN: The bear is at the back cell.\nLAURA: Scanlan, where are you?\nSAM: There's voices coming from the stairs?\nLIAM: Yeah, someone's coming.\nSAM: But there's a bear in the stairs.\nLAURA: Well, Trinket's coming down.\nMARISHA: I call, “Trinket, Trinket, Trinket (kissing SFX) Trinket!”","response":"DM: Trinket barely hears you from way over at the side."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (kissing SFX) Come on.","response":"DM: He's coming into this room. Clarota just steps back, along the side of the stairs and out of view. A few moments pass as the footsteps slowly trail off."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I leave and turn around where Vex and Vax are.\nMARISHA: I know.\nLAURA: What's in the other door?","response":"DM: The other door is currently locked from what you can tell."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: One moment. It is now not locked, I think.","response":"DM: (chuckles)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 25?","response":"DM: (clicking SFX) You push the door open and you see immediately, the fast moving heft of some large blade towards your head."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, snap!\nLAURA: Oh, it's Kima.\nLIAM: No, it's a trap ready to hit me.","response":"DM: That is 24 versus armor class."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That hits.\nLAURA: Oh, you didn't check for traps.\nLIAM: Didn't check for traps.\nTRAVIS: I thought you were good at this shit.\nLIAM: I'm going to use uncanny dodge.","response":"DM: What would have been 20 points of slashing damage is reduced to 10. So you take 10 damage as the axe (impact SFX) hits you and imbeds itself in the wooden door, pulls back. Now you see as a duergar wearing this nasty-looking black leather tunic with a hood pulled back, with a giant, gnarled, hefted greataxe, words escaped me on that one, has a bunch of scars on its face. As it's grinning, it pulls the axe out of the doorway."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right, I spit on the ground, and yank my belt off and throw it at his head.\nLAURA: And I yell 'hold.'","response":"DM: Okay. As you throw the belt–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hold?\nLAURA: Yeah, tell him to stop attacking.\nLIAM: Yeah, serpent.","response":"DM: –he ducks out of the way, pulls back out of the way, as the snake forms itself. It goes ahead and makes its attack. Go ahead and roll for snake attack against him."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Snake attack!\nLIAM: Okay, 12 plus, I don't know what, 12. Is my attack, his attack, snake attack?","response":"DM: Did you roll a 12 on that?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, that will not hit unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Is he in a cell?\nTRAVIS: Is a base attack a straight line from him to Vax to–\nSAM: He's protecting the cells.\nASHLEY: He's protecting the cells.","response":"DM: At which point he kicks the door closed again."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I, in my rage, bullrush through this?\nSAM: Yes, yes.","response":"DM: Now roll initiative, guys."}
{"prompt":"ORION: As he's going I immediately cast Stone Skin on myself. (cracking SFX)","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What I like is that there are eight of us and one of him.\nLAURA: Possibly, if no one else is behind that door.\nTALIESIN: So far.\nLAURA: He's in a room by himself.\nLIAM: I can see the square, it's very small.","response":"DM: You've looked inside, seeing a brief bit of the room. 25 to 20?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 26.\nLIAM: 20.\nLIAM: (shooting SFX)\nMARISHA: 18.\nLAURA: 15.\nORION: 19.","response":"DM: 15 to 10?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 14.","response":"DM: 14. 10 to five?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Seven.","response":"DM: Five to one?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (nervously) Four.\nTALIESIN: Where am I?","response":"DM: You are way back in this cell, and you hear a slam of broken wood and another slam of a door closing."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to run to the hall.","response":"DM: Make an acrobatics check to try and move through this cluster of people here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I can do that. 24.","response":"DM: 24. You leap over, vaulting off of Trinket, land and move into this hallway. And that's the extent of your movement."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try and take a shot and blow the lock.","response":"DM: Okay, with the Bad News or with your–?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh no, Bad News is away. This is just with the handheld, shooting at the lock at the door.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Jesus H, 30.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Nine points of damage.","response":"DM: Nine points of damage. As the door slams back and you prepare yourself to try and kick it open, you hear the familiar (zoom SFX) of one of Percy's pepperbox bullets as the actual handle of the door (impact SFX) gets blown off and there's a small hole in the wooden door now where its handle once was. The door swings open a little bit loosely due to the impact. That ends your turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That ends my turn.","response":"DM: Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. All I'm gonna do is grab the hole of the door and yank it open and yell, “Your turn, Grog!”\nMARISHA: Oh! That's fun!","response":"DM: As you pull it open, the dwarf backs up over what you can see now, this room is completely covered in a series of really nasty, hooked instruments. Hot irons, you can see large pincers–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh, it's like a torture chamber?","response":"DM: It's a torture chamber."}
{"prompt":"(all groan)\nTRAVIS: It's Christmas!\nTALIESIN: Grog is running into Toys R Us. This is going to be great.","response":"DM: You see gently as he backs away there is someone on this rack-like table. The dwarf backs up with his axe getting ready."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I use my bonus action to say, “You are so fucked, dwarf.”\nORION: I like where this is going, Vax. Wait, I go over there first and then I say that.","response":"DM: Acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Acrobatics, why?\nSAM: You gotta jump over people.","response":"DM: You've got to move through people. The area is congested. Small spaces, man. Downside of a big party."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay. 22.","response":"DM: 22. You manage to move through, push the bear out of the way. Move, Trinket. Get out the way!"}
{"prompt":"ORION: (muttering) Bear!","response":"DM: You manage to make your way, squeeze past Percy."}
{"prompt":"ORION: The bear surprisingly smells really nice.\nORION: I'm going to follow suit as I see what Vax is doing. I'm going to cast Hold Person on the dwarf.","response":"DM: You don't have visual on the dwarf currently, the dwarf is back–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: What? That's absurd!","response":"DM: As you run through the hallway - which you don't know there's a dwarf there - you rush out to the hallway after hearing all this commotion. You look in and there's an open door into a room that's currently vacant. You don't have enough movement to get close enough, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh well, poop. I… I encourage violence.","response":"DM: A wondrous use of an action."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Do it! Do it, Grog! Destroy them! With no regard to any of his existence.","response":"DM: Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's cozy down here. Okay, so with the dead body, I hear what's going on - we're roleplaying it up!\nORION: Get the body off of you.\nMARISHA: I morph into Minxy form.\nTRAVIS: Minxy!\nMARISHA: And as I morph into Minxy form, I take the dead body that's on top of me and just pick it up with my mouth.","response":"DM: In your mouth, the body stirs. It wasn't quite dead."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, why?!\nLAURA: (Gasps) Oh, Keyleth!\nMARISHA: It was supposed to be - I wanted the dead one.\nTRAVIS: Minxy says I'm sorry!\nMARISHA: Can I drop that one and find a dead one?","response":"DM: Well, you wanted a dead one. It is now."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Oh!\nMARISHA: That's fine, that's fine.\nLIAM: Oh, murdering children again.\nTALIESIN: Spend the entire game being the worst person in the world.\nMARISHA: I know! I try so hard, you guys!\nTRAVIS: Was it a child duergar?\nMARISHA: I try so hard, I'm still the fucking worst!","response":"DM: So, you now have a dead, gaunt dwarf, hanging from Minxy's mouth."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Keep chewing.\nMARISHA: Um, it was…\nTRAVIS: Oh, go ahead, do something else.\nTALIESIN: At least it's not gamey, it's fresh.\nMARISHA: Keyleth tries. Keyleth tries so hard.\nORION: You're not trying hard enough, damn it!\nTRAVIS: You hear a little dwarf in the corner go: “Mommy?”\nMARISHA: Vex brought up the fact that I killed a kid. I'm having all these memories coming back, I'm on the brink.","response":"DM: Yeah, there's some PTSD coming through."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So I've got this now-dead corpse in my mouth and I come out around the corner.","response":"DM: Make an Acrobatics check. Because you're still moving through this clustered hallway with a dead dwarf in your mouth."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Holy cow!\nMARISHA: I'm a tiger so–\nLIAM: That was Greyspine's cousin.\nMARISHA: Can I have an advantage? Oh, I rolled a 15. Plus being a tiger?","response":"DM: You're fine. You manage to push through, you're leaping through."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm pouncy. And I come out into the hallway.","response":"DM: You actually shift Tiberius out of the way. This is a very small space, you're a very big cat. You're really pushing for space here."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Move!","response":"DM: It's very, very tight quarters for you, you're like -"}
{"prompt":"(struggling SFX)\nORION: Keyleth, as a cat, you smell less good as Trinket does.\nMARISHA: It's not me, it's the dead body.\nORION: Oh. That's disgusting.\nMARISHA: And I look at the dwarf.","response":"DM: You can't see him from your vantage point, he's actually back out of sight."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I can't see him, you can't see him.\nMARISHA: No? Can I shift to see him at all?","response":"DM: You don't know there's a dwarf there. You just know there's some sort of commotion going on. You move around the corner and you see just an empty room."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Everybody give up your turn to Grog.\nLAURA: I know, let him go in the room.\nORION: Just let Grog deal with this butthole.\nMARISHA: I look at Grog and I foam at the mouth a little bit with the corpse and I–\nSAM: Encourage violence.\nMARISHA: –I encourage violence.\nMARISHA: Just gnawing on the dead dwarf.\nLAURA: Oh, well, let's make this nice and easy. I smack Grog on the ass and say, “Go get him”.\nTRAVIS: (eager snarling)\nTRAVIS: (eager snarling continues)\nMARISHA: Does he get advantage because we're all encouraging violence?\nORION: Yeah, or inspiration?","response":"DM: Oh no, you get inspiration dice for this whole set up. 1d8 inspiration dice."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You don't kill him in one shot, it's very very disappointing.\nTRAVIS: You said the room was full of shiny pointy things on the wall, right?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would like to bull rush the dwarf up and against the wall, try and spear him with all the sharp shit on the wall.","response":"DM: Okay!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Instant karma's going to get you, man.\nLIAM: You hear that, Keyleth?\nMARISHA: (growling)\nTRAVIS: 24.","response":"DM: Yeah, against his seven. You rush in and with your first attack, you grab him, lift him, and you can see there's a series of giant meat hooks hanging from the back of the wall, and you just lift him up and (impaling SFX) shove him down onto the hook which protrudes from the front of his chest. (gurgling SFX)"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, perfect. Tell me I get another attack.","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Excellent!","response":"DM: That's 12 points of damage and he's currently restrained by the hook through his chest."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Impaled? Oh!\nTRAVIS: Perfect! With my second attack as he's screaming out I reach inside, grab his lower jaw and pull him straight down.","response":"DM: Okay, make an attack roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no! That's so gross.\nASHLEY: Oh, I love this so much.\nLIAM: Vax is using his free hand to cover his eyes.\nSAM: Keyleth starts eating him.\nLAURA: Oh, sick.\nTRAVIS: With a 12?","response":"DM: For flavor, roll a 12. Why not? You're pulling his jaw."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: He rolled really high.\nTRAVIS: 15.","response":"DM: After you throw him onto the hook, his axe clatters to the ground and he reaches up with his hands to grab you and it looks like he's pulling back to try and bring you in for a headbutt. This angry look of burning rage in his white eyes, this fucked-up duergar with all these scars on his face, as he reaches up towards you, you take your giant hand and jam it into his maw. With this horrible (choking SFX) sound, as you put all your muscle into it, glaring him in the face with a terrible grin you (breaking SFX) and yank the jaw off from the bottom of his head."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I think he's going to make it.","response":"DM: Until eventually, he's no longer moving and you throw the jaw to the ground, just coated with blood."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're going to pull through, buddy.\nLAURA: Pike! I think Grog, um, I think he did his job.\nASHLEY: I scream out, “Good job Grog! That's your best one yet!”\nMARISHA: And they say video games are violent.\nLAURA: (gagging sounds)","response":"DM: As you've entered the room now–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wait, is he dead?","response":"DM: Oh, he's very dead."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We made cheese of him.","response":"DM: He lies there limply on the wall, twitching every few seconds. Grog, still in a rage, you look over at the other individual. You can see now strapped to this wooden frame is a smallish humanoid, female, currently chained and being pulled on a rack. You can see bunch of scars and wounds, blood pouring from each one of them."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is that our girl?\nLAURA: That's our girl!\nTALIESIN: I'm running in. Do I know how to disable the rack?","response":"DM: You can probably figure it out with a tinker."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Pike!\nTRAVIS: Is it chains or rope?\nLAURA: Come heal her!\nLIAM: We need Pike in here!\nTRAVIS: Is it chains or rope?\nSAM: I'll go!","response":"DM: It's chains holding her on."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to undo it.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait. Do we know it's her?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a tinker check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's her. It's gotta be her.\nORION: Whoever it is, we should help.\nTALIESIN: What do I add? Is it proficiency bonus?","response":"DM: Proficiency bonus."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 12.","response":"DM: 12? You take a moment and you manage to find where the winch to this machine is, where you can go ahead and release the tension and eventually the chains go a little more slack and (gasps) the halfling woman takes a deep breath and looks about the room a second, looks like there's a bit of a haze, but through the haze there's this constant anger and she looks down and goes: “So? Are you gonna let me go? Come on! Release these chains!”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Who is she?\nTRAVIS: Wait, wait. Find out who she is first.\nLAURA: Can we insight and make sure that it's really who she–","response":"DM: You can indeed. This is an insight check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Great, I don't get any… Anybody else want to roll for insight?\nLIAM: Five, one. Pike, roll well. The twins fucked it.\nASHLEY: Insight?\nLIAM: Scanlan! Come up here!\nSAM: Yeah, yeah, oh.\nASHLEY: 15! 15?\nLIAM: She's not in her right mind.","response":"DM: It's a very small room, only a few people can make it in here."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm gonna take a peek at her. What do I do? What do I roll?\nLIAM: Insight to see if she's in her right mind.\nASHLEY: 15? 18 is better.","response":"DM: At this point, it's pretty apparent that whatever this woman is, she's been here a while and has been subjected to many, many horrible things and still has that spark of life to her, mainly out of vengeance, anger, and pain, but she does not seem to be overtly aggressive or trying to deceive you; just trying to get out of these fucking chains."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, let's let her go.\nORION: I'll do an Arcana check on her.","response":"DM: What's that? Arcana check? To…?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: See if there's like any kind of magical impurities in her.\nTRAVIS: If she's under the Imperius Curse.","response":"DM: Best you can tell, there's none."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm pulling out my lockpicks and I'm going to start working on–\nSAM: I'm going to heal her with a little bit of a song.\nLIAM: And you know my lockpick snaps so… just totally broken.\nASHLEY: How hurt is she?\nSAM: If I may.","response":"DM: She's pretty rough. As you look up, she's not clothed. Her body is just a spray of scars and gashes and rake marks. She's been tortured to an extent you hadn't seen in person, and to still be tensing her muscles against the chains and looking at you with this intensity, if this is indeed Lady Kima, you now see why she's made the reputation she has."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Grog, the locking mechanism on this is jammed.\nSAM: Dadadanana, okay. I roll nine hit points.","response":"DM: The fresher wounds seal up, the blood flow comes to a stop. You see her muscles tense for a moment - her tension in her muscles relax for a minute. She looks to you for a second and says, “It's been a while since I've heard a song. Thank you.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It was a slow jam.\nTALIESIN: Please be careful for a moment. Can someone cover her ears for just a second?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I got it.\nASHLEY: Earmuffs.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to utility shot - I'm going to put my gun against the lock, somewhere where it will not harm her and just blow it.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll damage. You don't have to roll to hit, it's right there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 15. Is it two locks?","response":"DM: Well, there's one chain for the legs, one chain for the arms."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. 15 for the leg. 10 for the arm.","response":"DM: (gunshot sound) The legs get free. (gunshot sound) The chain mostly snaps on the top part, but not quite enough. It's enough for you, Grog, to-"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I got it! (snarling)","response":"DM: You reach over and bring it down, with a brief moment of extreme tension as the whole room watches Grog walk up with his axe and swing it down towards this halfling. Before you have a moment to stop, everyone's heart skips a beat. The chain is bisected–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ease down! Ease down.","response":"DM: –at which point the halfling woman immediately jumps to her feet with almost like a kip-up stand and is now standing on top of the table. Her arms are still bound and she - (groans) You can now see where the metal was weakened from the axe blow. She (metal snapping SFX) pulls herself free from the metal binding–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's hot.","response":"DM: –there's a blister across her wrist, from how long she's been pulling against these restraints. But she bore through it, with a little bit of blood that trickles from that wound. She has freed herself and she looks around the rest of the group. “So, I take it you're not from around here?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No! Would you like some water?","response":"DM: She grabs it from you, pulls off the cork and just starts chugging like she hasn't had anything to drink in a long time."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lady Kima, we need to get you out of here.\nLIAM: Allura has sent us.","response":"DM: She caps it off after a moment and takes a deep breath. “I'd hoped she would. It was foolish of me to come down here so unprepared. Just knew there wasn't much time.” (chuckles)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Time 'til what?","response":"DM: She looks around and says, “Look, we don't- it's a story. I have no–” And she kind of points to her pretty much unclothed, unarmored form, and says, “I need to find my implements. We need to get out of here.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Could I offer to you this black, studded leather, dwarven armor? It's not leather, actually.\nLIAM: It's magical, it'll fit you.\nORION: Would you care for this robe?\nLAURA: Which sounds better?","response":"DM: What armor were you offering her?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's the black, dwarven armor–\nLIAM: The armor that I found and gave to Grog. It's magical.","response":"DM: Oh, the studded leather."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.\nTRAVIS: It's in the bag.","response":"DM: She goes, “Sure, it works for now.” She takes it from you and starts putting it on. You see her wincing as she puts it on, as it covers some of the wounds. Her whole body is just sore, but she still pushes through it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm going to heal her a little bit more.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'll put my hands on her. I'm sorry. You're not fully healed, let me help you out.\nTRAVIS: (quietly) Grog likes scars.","response":"DM: As you do, she takes a moment and she says - You heal her and she goes, “Can I-” She sees your mace and goes, “Can I borrow that for a second?”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Uh…","response":"DM: “Please?”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: My mace?","response":"DM: “Your mace, please.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What do you need it for?\nTRAVIS: You can have mine.","response":"DM: “Do you trust me?”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I don't know. This is all I have to protect myself.","response":"DM: “You've come this far.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Grog has something for you.\nSAM: Say yes to life, Pike.\nASHLEY: Are you gonna give it back?","response":"DM: As you hand it out, she grabs it from your hands–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: That was rude.","response":"DM: –walks to the edge of the table–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I don't like her.","response":"DM: –stares at the dwarf that is currently hooked onto the wall. (angry yell) And with a yell, slams it right into his face, causing his head to explode against the back of the wall. Slams it again and again and again, and is just making hamburger of his entire body. The arm sloughs off and she's just going nuts. You can see her bludgeoning over and over again with a spray of gore on her. And there's this look of anger, frustration–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: She's raging.","response":"DM: –and a sick sense of joy a little bit in her eyes in how she's just tearing this dwarf apart. Eventually, after this frenzy, you're all taken aback, and she takes a moment. (heavy breathing) There is very little left recognizable of what once was a duergar."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I notice a bulge in Grog's pants.\nORION: I use my Mage Hand to slowly pick up my bottle of water…","response":"DM: Okay. She takes the mace she borrowed from you. (splatter sound)"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm sorry I questioned you.","response":"DM: As she begins to hand it back to you, there's a slight flash of radiant energy that emanates from her hand, and it burns all of the blood that currently encapsulates the mace off, and hands it back to you. “Thank you. I needed that.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: You're very welcome. I'm sorry I questioned you.\nORION: Give her something, Grog! Let her use one of your things!\nTRAVIS: That was amazing.\nORION: Like, you know, give her one of your things, Grog.\nTRAVIS: Could I, um, would you like to touch my axe?","response":"DM: “If you want to part with it, certainly.“"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, uh. (clears throat, sniffs) Maybe we should get out of here.\nTALIESIN: Why don't we collect your things?\nLAURA: Yeah, where are they? Do you know?\nTALIESIN: I would assume they're being stored upstairs.","response":"DM: “I have no idea. They're either in the vault or they're in the armory.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Vault or the armory? Those are places that we can go?\nLAURA: There's a vault?\nTALIESIN: Are there stairs in the room that we're in?","response":"DM: “As far as I can tell, my–”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Lady Kima, are these things absolutely necessary? We have a secret entrance to this place. We could leave now. Are they of vital importance, the things you've lost?","response":"DM: She thinks to herself for a second, and goes, “They are divine implements, gifted to me from an avatar of Bahamut directly. I feel, to leave them behind would be a partial failure to my quest. Not to mention, that what we may face beyond this, we'll need every bit of help we can get.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, shit.\nLIAM: Well, that's that then.\nORION: You'll have a friend in us, that's for sure.\nLAURA: Let's find the frigging vault!\nTALIESIN: Let's go upstairs.\nLIAM: Let's go to the vault! Let's go upstairs.","response":"DM: As you show the back of that card, she gives you a look and smiles and says, “Ah. It's good to see that your scale of color does not belie your intent. That is a face I've not seen for some time. I thank you.” She leaps off the table. “So.” (sighs) “Shall we?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do you know where the vault is?","response":"DM: “I can show you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) Yes!\nSAM: Lead the way!\nMARISHA: I go up to her, still in my Minxy form, and I rub on her legs.\nTALIESIN: Have you dropped the body yet?\nTRAVIS: I get right up behind them too, competing for space.\nTALIESIN: Are you dragging a dead body around?\nMARISHA: No, I dropped the body. While she was talking, I took the body, and I drug it back, and I buried my shame.\nMARISHA: So, first, I buried my shame.","response":"DM: Your shame has been sufficiently buried."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hashtag bury your shame.\nMARISHA: And I purr.","response":"DM: She doesn't look at you, but she pats you absentmindedly as she passes you, her direct intent on heading back up those stairs herself."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's go, but should we unlock all the other dwarves?\nLAURA: Yes, let's let all the other dwarves out, and maybe give them some food to try to help them out, if we can.\nTRAVIS: In the meantime, I have a greatsword or a morningstar mace that you can have until we find your items.","response":"DM: “Greatsword.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Greatsword it is.","response":"DM: She takes it from you, and the sword is a little over a foot taller than she is. Maybe a little more than that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: She's really fricking buff.","response":"DM: But as you hand it to her, she still takes it, and you can see–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She's a ripped halfling.\nLAURA: That's pretty badass.","response":"DM: –she is a built halfling female. She has seen some war, and she  has survived some shit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She's the Tyler Durden of halflings.","response":"DM: Kind of, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: As I see her grab the sword, I ask, “Would you care for some ale?”","response":"DM: She glances over her shoulder at you, and says, “Later. We have nothing to celebrate for yet.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Absolutely. Plenty of time!\nLIAM: I think Grog is smitten!\nLAURA: She comes to your knee.\nLIAM: Oh my goodness!\nLAURA: Can I run in the little prison, and tell the dwarves, if they are conscious, to say, “Don't exit from where you came. There's a secret entrance up and in a store room. Go that way, and stealth out.”","response":"DM: One of the ones that was semi-conscious–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: All of that, I say all of it.\nLAURA: Here's some cheese!","response":"DM: He takes it hungrily through the bars and just starts eating it, incessantly, as you leave."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Government cheese.\nLIAM: Is provolone all you've got?","response":"DM: Lady Kima's already up the stairs."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's Velveeta.","response":"DM: (disgusted groan) Velveeta!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We're following up the stairs.\nLAURA: Oh goodness, oh goodness!\nTALIESIN: It's going to be fun! Savage burning–\nTRAVIS: I'm right with Minxy, competing for first place.\nLIAM: I place a hand on Lady Kima's shoulder–\nMARISHA: First place, for how fucked-up we are.\nLIAM: –place a hand on Kima's shoulder and say, “Please, allow me,” and move several feet ahead of her and start sneaking along.","response":"DM: As you move up to her, you notice she's standing at the bottom of the stairs with a tension, staring up at the top of the stairway, where Clarota is looking down at her–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)","response":"DM: –and backing away, and she goes–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! Yes. Uh–\nLAURA: Wait- Wait!","response":"DM: “Who is this filthy–”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No no no no!\nMARISHA: (screams)\nORION: I put my Mage Hand in front of her. Wait, wa-wait! Hold on! It- it's fine! Er, this mind flayer is with us! We saved him, or he- he's our ally now; he's fine. No one needs to fight. He, uh, she's fine, he's fine. His name is Clarota.\nTALIESIN: He's been an enormous help.","response":"DM: Without taking her eyes off of Clarota–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: This is Kiva-\nSAM: Kima.\nORION: Kima.\nORION: We are allies, all, yes?","response":"DM: “Are you to tell me that you've come down here and allied yourself with an entity that is the anathema of the Mountain?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes!\nTRAVIS: Uh, what was that word?\nLIAM: I'm right at her shoulder, so I say, “We understand he's dangerous, but he's gotten us this far.”","response":"DM: “And for what purpose? You think they don't have plots lined out for weeks and months–”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, no, no! Listen, listen-","response":"DM: “–there is no trust to be had with these creatures.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He has been shit out by these creatures. They do not want him or trust him. He is an outcast. And we are working together, in this moment, and without him we would not have gotten here.\nLAURA: We see a single tear drop from Clarota's eye.","response":"DM: “And with him you will never get out.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No! We have his, er, alliance. There's a greater entity controlling his people, which he has been outcast from, like Vax was saying!","response":"DM: “And have you not thought for a second that perhaps all of you are being manipulated by this creature?”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Well, I have.","response":"DM: You can see the greatsword now flares with divine energy and she goes, “I will not stand here and let us ally ourselves with this filth!”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: (shouting) “Lady Kima!” And I blow fire breath. And I use Control Flames to create a bunch of swords around me with fire.\nLAURA: Don't threaten Kima! She's better.\nORION: (harshly) I give you my word.","response":"DM: Her attention divided from Clarota, now tends towards you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Don't act me a fool, and don't treat me like one either! None of us are half-wits as you are claiming. We would not be fooled by such a creature like this. The words he speaks are true. And we believe him.","response":"DM: You go ahead and make a diplomacy check. Or a persuasion. Persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god!\nLIAM: Get it on, Tiberius!\nTRAVIS: Do it.\nLIAM: Get. It. On.\nORION: That's terrible.\nLIAM: Oh. Get it off?\nSAM: Not good.\nLAURA: Not good?\nSAM: Not good!\nORION: 12.","response":"DM: 12. Okay. She walks towards you, and with each step, you can see the color of her eyes begins to vanish, giving way to an extremely bright, burning, silver light. And she says–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) Oh my god, she's so cool!","response":"DM: “Listen. You come with me. Without this creature! Or you continue with it, and without me.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Why you have to be like that?","response":"DM: “I will not walk beside this. I have had its people devour mine since I set foot in here. This creature, whatever its reasoning is, is not in your best interest. It will lead you into a web of your own destruction! I've seen their kind work.“"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Clarota!\nORION: Yeah, they're mostly buttholes, but he's not a butthole!\nORION: I understand that -\nLIAM: Clarota!\nORION: - we had to kill a couple and he actually helped a lot!\nLIAM: Speak your mind! Convince her. Fix this.","response":"DM: Clarota, at the top of the stairs, you can see his tendrils in his mouth curl back in a sneer, his hands crossed before–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: He won't even do anything!","response":"DM: –Clarota says, (gasping, breathy voice) \"Listen. I am not going to walk where I am not welcome. I will not wake up with this–”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Giving us a Walking Dead decision.","response":"DM: “–woman's blade in my back! We made a deal.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: People with kids. You deal with this all the time.\nLIAM: I walk between them and put hands out.\nLAURA: Come on, roll a 20!\nLIAM: And say, “We all want the same thing. Kima. Tell us. What is it that you've come here for? What is your purpose here? Speak your mind, if you are true.”","response":"DM: Kima turns back towards you, the same glowing flare in her eyes. “I've come here to rid this mountain and this continent of the darkness that resides deep within the bowels of this thing's city!”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Clarota, why have you come here. What is it you seek?","response":"DM: Clarota settles into itself for a second. “Ah, I've come to destroy this creature K'Varn and free my people.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Then the two of you. Get over your fucking shit.\nLIAM: We want the same thing here. Get over yourselves. Both of you. We share a common purpose. We are going to end this fucking bullshit. Kima, we have come here for you. Pay us the respect that we have earned. We have come a long way for you. He is an unlikely ally, but he has gotten us to this point. And together, for this moment and this moment only, we can work together. We don't have to be school chums or buddies in a week from now. But right now, right here, we will work together and achieve the same thing. What say you, Kima?","response":"DM: She looks towards you and says, “Free his people, he says. What do you think will happen once his people are free? Shall they let us walk out on our own?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes! He said so! And then they'll be buttholes when we leave!","response":"DM: “You know so very little of these dark caverns, my dragon friend.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, it's our first time here!\nLAURA: But they were under control of K'Varn at that point. Yeah!","response":"DM: “Oh! Understand; whether or not K'Varn controls them to give them direction, they are of that type of mindset at all points. They do not hope society will thrive. They do not want us free peoples to walk the surface. They want us for food.“"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Lady Kima, if I may. If you're intending us to choose between you, and our ally Clarota, and we can't get you to see eye to eye with us, then I'm afraid you leave us no choice but to choose our own friend Clarota over you.\nLAURA: (gasps) What?\nSAM: We're giving you one last chance. Either you are with us, or you are against us. This is a threat.","response":"DM: “So you walk in here, save me from my binds, under the words of my dear, lifelong friend Arcanist Allura–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We mean you no ill will. It is you who are aggravating the situation.\nLIAM: You could be sitting in a cell by yourself doing fuck-all, or ending this problem now.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Everyone's giving her inspirational talks.\nLAURA: I'm so nervous! Oh, Scanlan, come on!\nSAM: Well, I rolled a three…\nLIAM: I rolled a 13.\nSAM: But I have a plus 13! So that's a 16.\nLIAM: Plus 13? Three plus 13? Okay.\nASHLEY: Plus, plus, uh… hold on.\nASHLEY: Because, you didn't- where the fuck.\nASHLEY: War God's Blessing!","response":"DM: Cleric flail!"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: No, I can't do that, because that's when a person makes an attack roll.\nASHLEY: Get 'em, Scanlan!\nTALIESIN: Can I assist?\nLAURA: He assisted because he was talking–","response":"DM: Unfortunately, it's too late. Once the roll–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, he was with me, he was with me.\nLAURA: He assisted?","response":"DM: Right, right. And because of that, the DC has been considered. She takes a moment and steps forward. She's a few inches taller than you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Of course she is! Everyone is!","response":"DM: And she looks at you, and says, “He of the pretty voice. I am grateful that all of you have come and traversed all this danger in my name, to free me from the binds that have held me. And I do wish, very much, to walk alongside you to this end. And I understand, it may be very well possible that this thing has taken your minds without your knowledge. However–” And her eyes close for a second, and she opens them again, and that radiant spark of silver fades, and her normal eye color returns. “We see ourselves with little choices. And I have very little allies at this point to achieve my goal.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) Oh, thank god.","response":"DM: “If we are to travel together, this one must walk in step the entire time. One single misstep, and I will not hesitate to carve that head from your body in the name of Bahamut.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm sorry. Do you mean like dancing?\nTRAVIS: I will help you do that if he missteps.","response":"DM: Clarota, hands still crossed, takes a step down the stairs towards her. Its tendrils in its mouth kind of– (slurping SFX) (breathy voice) “And please, understand, if you ever intend to try and cut my life short, I will also not hesitate to bore that beautiful mind from your skull.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: So friends then?\nORION: Allies, allies.\nTRAVIS: Allies, allies.\nLAURA: Allies?\nTALIESIN: I suppose everybody understands everyone now.\nORION: Allies. Clarota likes allies.\nLAURA: Good times.\nLIAM: The enemy of my enemy…\nORION: Is…\nLAURA: Is my…\nSAM: Has mind-sucking tentacles.","response":"DM: She looks back at the rest of you and gives you all an understanding look and a nod and she says, “I pray that you are right. I pray that you're honest and I pray that through some strange will of the gods, this entity is telling the truth. Because if it's not, none of us will make it out of here alive.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're playing a game of chess here, Kima, and we will win.\nLAURA: I whisper in her ear: “I would have chosen you.”\nSAM: And I start humming 'Kumbaya'.\nORION: I take the dagger and make a happy face of fire.","response":"DM: She doesn't notice this, as she steps up the stairs towards Clarota."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god. Okay.","response":"DM: –To the first level."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Killing two guards on the way.","response":"DM: Clarota puts the hands folded back together. (unimpressed huff) (breathy voice) “Shall we?” And walks up the stairs after her. And you all begin to ascend back onto the first floor and that's where we'll end the game for this evening."}
{"prompt":"(Multiple groans and exclamations)\nMARISHA: What? No. What time is it? I thought we just got started?\nTRAVIS: I thought we were going to have to pick. We got like ten more minutes!\nMARISHA: Yeah, we have ten more minutes.\nSAM: No, no, no. That's fine, that's fine.\nLAURA: No, yeah, that is a good place, or we're going to get in a battle.","response":"DM: (chuckles) Depending on where you guys are going next it could be a bit of a lengthy encounter, so…"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god.\nLIAM: So the building is empty.","response":"DM: It's totally empty."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Completely empty.\nLIAM: There's ghouls everywhere.","response":"DM: There's nobody in there. No one has any idea that you're here."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Wait, show of hands, if we have to pick between one or the other, who's picking Kima?\nORION: Oh, Kima?\nTRAVIS: Who's picking turtle-face?\nLIAM: I don't know.\nORION: She's Allura's friend, right?\nTRAVIS: We're going to throw down, this is gonna be Marvel versus DC in this bitch.\nLAURA: She's Allura's friend, she's good!\nLIAM: Undecided, I don't know.\nLAURA: Would you pick Kima?\nTRAVIS: Yeah!\nLAURA: Okay, yeah.\nSAM: You just want her because she's badass and you could hump her.\nTRAVIS: Yeah!","response":"DM: Oh, Grog."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That would be the most awkward humping ever.\nORION: That's a good idea. Grog! You can go hump, I can get Allura.\nLIAM: She can hump your leg.\nTRAVIS: Did you see her work in that room of blood?\nTALIESIN: Only one of them is demanding that I become a liar.\nMARISHA: Isn't Kima a dwarf?","response":"DM: No, Kima is a halfling."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Kima is a halfling.\nMARISHA: Halfling?\nLIAM: She's a ropy, muscular, halfling.\nASHLEY: Wait, dang it! I wanted to take some torture weapons!","response":"DM: You can go back if you want to."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah, can I go back since we have ten minutes and go get some torture weapons?\nLIAM: What's it for?!","response":"DM: This would be pretty quick, you have to grab some things as everyone is heading up the stairs."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Who's your deity? Harvey Keitel?\nASHLEY: No! Just for Grog!","response":"DM: So, Pike, the war priest, however, who the light of Sarenrae has guided her through her life, once a gifted being of light and joy, upon coming to the edge of death, her soul taken from her form and returned, going at sea and traveling with some of the more rough and tumble folks of the landscape, has returned now with her mind bent on war, vengeance–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah!","response":"DM: –and what it means to win a battle, through force if necessary. Watching Pike rush off and going to gather up what appear to be two large, bladed hooks–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (hissing)","response":"DM: .–a lengthy hand-razor–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Nice.\nASHLEY: Okay, wait, hold on. Lengthy hand-razor…\nMARISHA: You're going to go Sweeney Todd all up in this shit.\nLAURA: (mimicking Ashley) Hold on, hold on. Lengthy hand-razor.\nLIAM: A Milli Vanilli album, and…\nASHLEY: Wait, what was the first one?","response":"DM: Two large, pointed hooks that are about two feet in length. Almost like a bladed jai alai."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: And you gather a small bag of various instruments that are rusty and nasty."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ew.","response":"DM: There is just some leather pouch and you put that in your bag. It's all you have time to grab before you have to bolt back up to get to the rest."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (swishing SFX)","response":"DM: And we'll pick up the next game as you guys head up the stairs back into the hallway you first entered in the center of the Emberhold duergar stronghold, Lady Kima released and a very tentative alliance. So, thank you guys all for watching."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Whoo!\nMARISHA: Pain in the ass, Lady Kima. Pain in my ass.\nLAURA: Hey.\nZAC: Oh hey.","response":"DM: Hello, Zac!"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: I was doing my little pop-ins here.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: So we had some donations to the charity.","response":"DM: Oh, that's awesome!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Really?\nMARISHA: Yeah!\nMARISHA: Thanks guys.\nZAC: I have really terrible handwriting, so… So I wrote these myself and I'm supposed to read them and…","response":"DM: Right, right, that's okay."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: TheConman93.","response":"DM: Conman93, thank you!"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: …Marilyn?","response":"DM: Marilyn, thank you!"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: A123Junior.","response":"DM: A123Junior, appreciate it, buddy."}

{"prompt":"ZAC: Almsnuffufin… Um, Eon? Something?","response":"DM: Yeah MisnurMenfrishunsen."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: AxisOfAnarchy…","response":"DM: Thank you. Nice, Axis."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: RuzGofDi.","response":"DM: RuzGofDi! Thank you guys so much for donating! Really appreciate it."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Give to charity. Thank you.","response":"DM: Thank you, guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice!\nZAC: And tomorrow we're having a special party to celebrate our reaching 2,000 subscribers.","response":"DM: Yeah. That's awesome."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: You guys are all welcome to stop by.","response":"DM: We might just do that. Awesome."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: It's from sevem to nine we'll have a band playing, we're gonna do some fun group games. Probably play some inappropriate Cards Against Humanity. And Super Fight and stuff like that.","response":"DM: As if there was appropriate Cards Against Humanity."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Every time I break it out, I'm like, I should never do this.","response":"DM: I know. It's part of the fun. And we're every Thursday, seven o'clock, 7PM Pacific Standard Time. Usually we run about two and a half, three hours, our game sessions. So please come watch every Thursday. We love to have you guys."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: And for Team Hooman tomorrow is Ify Appreciation Day. So if you guys want to get on that. And for those that know Ify as sholfboys and not much else, Ify is a really prominent figure in the local comedy scene and he does a lot of work on shows like Key & Peele, Comedy Bang! Bang!, stuff like that. He's a really talented dude. You should look him up before you write those tweets just so you know more of what he's about. And we are going to throw that dropcam up and set up for dancing. If any of you want to stay, you're welcome to. If not, you're welcome to leave.  No one is going to force you, except chatroom now that I brought it up.\nASHLEY: I mean, it's a good workout after all this food.\nZAC: You burn some calories after all that chicken, right?\nASHLEY: Burn some calories…\nLAURA: Right, right.","response":"DM: Exactly."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: We are, I think, 20 away from a giveaway. So as long as we're live, the giveaway counts.\nTRAVIS: Is valid.","response":"DM: Exactly."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: So, if you get 20 subs before we go offline we will ship this wherever you are in the world. So, let's throw the dropcam up!","response":"DM: Yeah guys, thank you so much! (kiss)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: And we found her!","response":"DM: You did. I was going to get to that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Your foot is melted off.\nLIAM: It's kind of there (groans).","response":"DM: Mostly. There's some… You can see four of the five toes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that's not bad. It's four out of five.","response":"DM: About three and a half."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Did I lose the big or the small?\nASHLEY: Oh, you can do without the pinkie.\nMARISHA: Your balance is probably a little wonky.","response":"DM: Yeah, a little bit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Clears that athlete's foot, though. Gone.","response":"DM: Sure enough."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is anyone following us? Can we do a quick check around and just see?","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Perception check? Starting it off with a 19.","response":"DM: Glancing around, you start hearing various duergar screams from above as the individuals that were still inside the fortress are in the process of trying to get out, or in the process of slowly melting in the molten rock. What you do also notice is that off towards the bottom base of the stronghold, a number of duergar that reside in the buildings that surround the exterior of Emberhold proper are mounting arms and charging up towards the stronghold to give aid to wherever this seeming, loud shouting and screaming is coming from."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can they see us?\nMARISHA: Does anyone seem to be paying attention to us?","response":"DM: No, they're far enough away where you don't think it's an issue, and you're off to the side, for the moment. But you do see probably close to 30 to 40 duergar are currently swarming out the small city, making their way towards Emberhold."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So right now they're focused on the chaos of the temple?","response":"DM: From what you can see."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We should get out of here.\nLAURA: There was a path further down that led further on into the tunnels. I think we should follow that.\nMARISHA: Well, hang on. Grog can't be far, right?\nSAM: He could be in another dimension.\nMARISHA: No, he can only be a thousand feet away.\nSAM: Says who?\nMARISHA: They used the spell Dimension Door that Tiberius has.\nLAURA: So we hope he used Dimension Door.\nSAM: I have a spell that can go to another dimension (chuckles).\nMARISHA: Well, I remember the gods on high telling us last week that we recognized the spell that was used.\nSAM: By the way, this is the best conversation we've ever had with Tiberius.\nLAURA: Oh, Tiberius.","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He has no idea what's happening.","response":"DM: He's in darkness. He can't hear. He's not conscious."}
{"prompt":"SAM: If Grog is close, we still need to get out of the way of these 30 people. So let's go hide.\nLAURA: We still need to hide. And heal.\nTALIESIN: Let's at least follow the path, find a place where we can hide, and recuperate.\nLAURA: Around the corner or something. Can we stealth further down?","response":"DM: You can try to. You currently are carrying two large solid stone statues with you, so it's definitely possible, but you're going to have to come up with a creative way of doing so."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Grog had the rug, didn't he?","response":"DM: Grog had the entire bag of holding."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Shit!\nMARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast Pass Without a Trace on the party.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Percy, I think you and I are on Tiberius duty.\nTALIESIN: Yes. (sighs) Okay.\nSAM: If we do not move, will this 30 duergar mass hit us at some point?","response":"DM: You can find out."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's like asking the future.\nLAURA: Can I use my robe of infinite twine, which I have on my person in another game before. Because it's connected to my rope. Can I use that and tie it around Kima and hook it to Trinket so he can drag Kima along?","response":"DM: You can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nTALIESIN: Very clever.","response":"DM: So I will say for this circumstance as you guys are preparing this: casting the spell, beginning dragging the stone. The group make an initiative check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We took too much time!\nLAURA: We should just run.\nTALIESIN: Natural 20.","response":"DM: Yeah, you have some flashing, there we go."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's been a kind die to you.","response":"DM: So, 20 plus whatever your initiative modifier is."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 27.","response":"DM: 27."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 13.\nORION: Who cares.\nSAM: Ten.\nASHLEY: 12.\nLAURA: 17.\nLIAM: 15.\nSAM: Distract them. Get them away from us.","response":"DM: You guys begin to drag the stone, or (chuckles) your two stone companions across the jagged obsidian floor in this deep, dark cavern. The heat from the nearby lava fall is still causing you to sweat profusely, and you're sore from the previous battle you just endured. Those of you who are wounded, you can feel the stretch of the muscles and tearing of what sinew has taken damage in the process. As you begin to pull, parallel to this duct of lava that pours off the side of Emberhold, you keep low so that you aren't actually blocking the light source, which would be a very keen visual to anything that's looking in that direction from a distance, but you slowly make your way across. At this point, the duergar have not been able to get there before you guys move off from the side, so they haven't caught up to the position you were previously, but they're beginning to swarm around the sides, and you see them yelling at each other and shouting commands. Some of them are starting to grab large rocks and fill in areas of the stronghold. Some of them you can see are robed individuals begin casting spells. You can see portions of other stone walls beginning to mount up and try and block the flow from the interior and exterior of Emberhold. However, you guys are still within eyesight, technically, of any duergar on that side of the fortress, so I'm going to ask everyone now to make a stealth check. Those that are pulling the statues with disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So that's Trinket.\nORION: Plus ten.\nLAURA: But we all add plus ten?","response":"DM: Correct. To the final roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nLIAM: I have a question. If I have advantage for other reasons– I have a cloak of elvenkind which gives me advantage– does the advantage and disadvantage cancel out into one?","response":"DM: They do. Your foot being wounded, though, is a disadvantage right now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right.","response":"DM: So that then goes back down to disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can't win with this guy.","response":"DM: Just for this circumstance, unfortunately. You're dragging a statue with a partially melted foot right now."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Liam, it doesn't matter.\nMARISHA: You still have plus ten to the roll because Pass Without a Trace.","response":"DM: So?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 14.","response":"DM: Plus the ten?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: That's including the ten.\nMARISHA: 22.\nTALIESIN: 11.\nASHLEY: 20. That's my low roll.\nLAURA: That's 20 for Trinket and 29 for me.\nLIAM: 25.\nTALIESIN: Keyleth, can you cover the entrance to where we are to give us a little bit more of a stealthy–\nMARISHA: No.\nLAURA: No more spells?\nMARISHA: I am exhausted. I can't do anything else right now.\nLIAM: And what's the terrain? Is it just flat out out in the open to see, or is it scoured with ins and outs? Peaks and valleys?","response":"DM: It's the same type of topography you've encountered when you first entered this giant cavern. So you can see large, crooked black spires of obsidian rock shooting up and curving towards the ceiling. It's all over the place."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can make another Hallucinatory Terrain. I can do that still.\nLAURA: Okay, maybe you can make it–\nMARISHA: Can I make it to where it just looks like a wall?","response":"DM: How long does it last?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I think Hallucinatory Terrain lasts an hour, if I think about it. Books, books, where's my book?\nLAURA: Can I look around and see if there's anywhere that looks like we could hide, tuck in between rocks or something where we wouldn't be visible?\nTALIESIN: Please.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a perception."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh wait, I get an advantage.","response":"DM: Because you are in the Underdark, correct."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 20.\nMARISHA: It lasts for 24 hours.\nSAM: 24 hours!\nTALIESIN: Put a lava flow in front of us.\nSAM: But you have to be concentrating the whole time. And you can't. You can't go to sleep.\nLAURA: 20.","response":"DM: As she's glancing at that, you make your way about ten minutes away from the area where the rest of the group is currently gathered, keeping a very very close eye on the topography of the wall of the cavern as it slowly curves around and further in that direction. You do manage to find portions of the wall that jut out and leave these small pockets. They themselves might not be super safe for a long period of time, but they give you a little bit of–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Cover.","response":"DM: Little bit of cover, depending on how well you were to dress. You might be able to see few individuals discovering you if you were to stay there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Let's do that.\nMARISHA: It's not a concentration spell. It just takes a minute to cast and it lasts for 24 hours. So I'm going to go ahead and cast it and make it look like there's just a wall with another lava flow that's come out, and is starting to happen.","response":"DM: Okay, so as you walk back to notify the party, you watch as a portion of the mountain seemingly out of nowhere, extends, and a lava flow appears, pouring out of the wall."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, was someone not inside?\nSAM: No, we're all in.","response":"DM: She was out and about while you did this."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I was searching for another place to hide.\nLIAM: It's fine. It's an illusion. Vax pokes his head through the illusionary lava and goes, We're in here.\nLAURA: Oh! Lovely.","response":"DM: So your heart rate eventually normalizes. You do have a decent pocket of space here that as long as nothing attempts to walk into the wall, you should be okay to rest here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So we have some time. Let's regroup.\nLAURA: I think we should probably–\nTALIESIN: Sleep in shifts.\nMARISHA: Wait, here's what I'm afraid of. If we sleep we could lose Grog's trail. He could be nearby right now.\nTALIESIN: We're not much use to anyone right now.\nSAM: Let's just make a decision right now to leave Grog and continue on.\nASHLEY: No!\nSAM: Let's just forget about him. He was a good friend.\nLAURA: What?!\nSAM: We'll have a toast to him.\nLAURA and ASHLEY: Scanlan!\nSAM: We'll sing about songs of his memory.\nMARISHA: You are shitting with us, right?!\nSAM: Within a few days we'll forget he ever existed.\nTALIESIN: Scanlan, no one else wants to go to a whorehouse with you. You'll be going to whorehouses alone.\nTALIESIN: Thank you.\nLIAM: Here's another option. My foot hurts, but I'm not too bad. How are you?\nLAURA: (sighs) I'm okay.\nLIAM: We could go look.\nLAURA: Or maybe I can use my tracking and see if I can catch a scent. Grog does smell.\nMARISHA: I can use my beast sense; that is one more thing I can still do. I could theoretically– We could use Trinket.\nLIAM: We need to undo the stone that has taken over Tiberius and Kima.\nTALIESIN: Do I have the necessary tools to synthesize a potion out of the basilisk blood?","response":"DM: You can certainly try. It's a very ramshackle set-up. You do not have an alchemical set, but you can certainly attempt to, using a small fire, a couple of your general smelting tools you use for your metal work. You could attempt to distill it down, but that would be a combination of a tinkering roll on your point, followed up by somebody else's medicine roll to attempt to properly prepare it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are all of Tiberius's things stone with him?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm going to walk over to Tiberius and cast Greater Restoration on him.","response":"DM: Okay. So as you're having this discussion. Tiberius, you briefly go from this moment in the heat of combat where you feel your muscles intensify and tensing up and not answering to your mind's command as you look up angrily at a series of duergar that have just been blown up by a fireball, to cold taking yourself. And as the cold fades, you are now in the center of a gargantuan cavern surrounded by all of your friends. You guys watch as Tiberius's form fades in through the stone."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA and ASHLEY: Tiberius!\nLAURA: Good job Pike!\nSAM: I was so worried about you!\nTALIESIN: Or we could cast a spell. That also works well.\nORION: (Dwarven accent) What the hell is going on?\nASHLEY: I didn't know if that was going to work.\nMARISHA: But that the only time you can do that, right?\nLAURA: Wait, she can't do that again? You can't do it again for Kima.\nASHLEY: I have another 5th level now, so I could do it again.\nLAURA: And once we rest, you'll have it again?\nORION: (Dwarven accent) Whoa. What happened to all the other little dwarves?\nSAM: You don't have to do the accent anymore.\nLAURA: You probably should keep your voice down, Tiberius.\nORION: Well, this is just how I sound.\nASHLEY: No. We already got through. We're on the other side. You don't have to act like a god anymore.\nLAURA: Grog is missing, actually.\nORION: (Dwarven accent) Oh, great.\nLAURA: And the queen took him.\nSAM: Are you stuck like this?\nORION: No, I could change back anytime I want, but I really like how I look.\nASHLEY: Are we going to rest?\nSAM: Wait, but what about Kima?\nMARISHA: We have to find Grog!\nLAURA: We have to find Grog but we have no spells. If we do find him, we can't do anything!\nSAM: Can you unstone Kima now or?\nASHLEY: I can, but then I wouldn't have another 5th level.\nORION: (Dwarven accent) Clarota, what do you think we should do?","response":"DM: Clarota, who is currently like staring at the statue of Kima, you can see there's a brief bead of thought behind Clarota's eyes and the voice sinks into the rest of your minds simultaneously. “We may be able to leave her here for safekeeping.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I knew you were going to say that. A different option. Oh, and thank you, Pike.\nASHLEY: You're welcome, Tiberius.","response":"DM: “If you insist on bringing her, then we should do it soon. We should not be leaving anything behind. Trace of our passage.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Where did your kin take our big friend?","response":"DM: Clarota thinks for a second and says, “It was not my kin that took him but the duergar. If anything, I imagine he might be residing within that infernal city, though if they've taken him elsewhere I do not know the way of the ash-skins.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: But Kima does.\nLAURA: We should wake her up.\nORION: Pike, you can do it one more time and take a little rest, right?\nASHLEY: I am going to walk on over to Kima. Touch her. Cast Greater Restoration again.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I touch her arm.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Don't cheapen this.","response":"DM: Classy. As you reach out, the divine energy emanates from Pike's hand that begins to cascade across Kima's form. Kima, who is in mid battle, with her greatsword in the air, as soon as her flesh returns to her, she finishes her swing."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I put my shield up!","response":"DM: However, it does (ping) into the side of your shield and you deflect the blow and you see Kima for a second is like, (panting slowing to normal breathing)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Easy! Easy!\nASHLEY: Calm down!","response":"DM: She throws the blade down on the ground and goes, “I am so sorry.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: It's okay! You were mid-swing, I get it. We are fine it was just a shield. We're fine.","response":"DM: She reaches around and she pulls her symbol of Bahamut out from her around her neck and just clutches it for a second and says, “What happened?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You were turned to stone, the king got killed, the queen took Grog, we don't know where.\nSAM: And Clarota was really helpful to us.\nLAURA: Actually, Clarota got you out of that castle alive.","response":"DM: She turns around and glares at Clarota briefly with a look of confusion and mistrust and Clarota just goes–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You honestly would not be here if it weren't for the illithid. It's true.","response":"DM: She glances back at you and gives under her breath, “And there's a good chance none of us may be here if it gets its way down the road. (louder) Nevertheless, I thank you. It is good to know at least we took one of their top champions down. The fact that the queen still exists is worrisome, as at least from what I seemed to gather she had the true reign over most of the duergar down here.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Do you know where she would be at?","response":"DM: “Where did she escape? How did she take him?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She disappeared with our goliath friend.\nLAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh. Wait, did I Hunter's Mark the queen?\nLIAM: Yes, you did.\nLAURA: Did I?\nTALIESIN: You did.\nLAURA: I can use my Hunter's Mark to track her!\nSAM: You can?\nSAM: How long does it last and how does it work?\nLIAM: But that was just 30 minutes ago.\nSAM: I know, but we all have to rest.\nLAURA: It maintains for up to eight hours!\nSAM: Eight hours, but we have to rest!\nASHLEY: Because we need to heal. I am pretty low.\nSAM: I'm at two.\nASHLEY: You're at two?!\nMARISHA: Okay. Theory? Proposition? Proposal. What if we use your Hunter's Mark, figure out where she is, get there, camp out nearby, tackle it in the morning?\nLAURA: Can I use my Hunter's Mark to find out where she is and then we rest and go there?","response":"DM: You can attempt that."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What if we took a short rest?\nLAURA: Wait, wait, wait. Let's just find out where she is first.\nASHLEY: What if we just took a seven-hour nap?\nASHLEY: Because that's all really anyone sleeps anyway.\nTALIESIN: I think six hours is about what it takes.","response":"DM: Six to eight hours is the general long rest period that I would allow for that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and ASHLEY: Okay.\nLIAM: I think we should all rest for a moment. I think Vex'ahlia and I should go out for an hour or two, just to see which direction– I mean, they are not going to back to Emon.\nLAURA: I've got Hunter's Mark! Just stay put, Footless!\nORION: Wait a minute. What happened to your toe?\nSAM: You're not stealth anymore. You got a busted foot. You're at disadvantage on everything.\nLIAM: I was pretty awesome 30 minutes ago. Now I'm just slightly less awesome.\nSAM: Can we at least heal you up, before you go?\nLAURA: Yes. Just give us one second. Can I use the freaking Hunter's Mark?\nSAM: How does it work?\nLAURA: I don't know!","response":"DM: So you take a moment, you step beyond the boundary of the illusion momentarily, close your eyes and concentrate on that small blip of nature based divine energy that you lent and grappled onto Queen Ulara with. You take a moment and concentrate and you recall her face, you recall, strangely, her scent. In a weird way, the bestial nature of your connection with Trinket and nature, scent is a very strong means of tracking and the scent of a duergar is a very terrible mix between salty brine and earth."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Like Axe for Men?","response":"DM: Essentially, yeah, yeah. It's Ye Olde Axe. You concentrate on this and you recall the stronghold, you begin to see a trace where all of a sudden her path in the stronghold is fading and is cold. A new path has opened up in the center of the duergar city at the base of the stronghold. It seems to have moved slightly in that direction, but you can't pinpoint where, and is currently at rest somewhere in that vicinity."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She is still close.\nLAURA: (whispers) The city, they're close. (louder) So that is right in front of the keep?\nMARISHA: Wait. Are they in an underground base?\nLAURA: They are in the city.","response":"DM: Essentially, where the cavern kind of rises up and meets the wall, Emberhold is at the top of that rising of the ground, and Emberhold lies there, where all the lava pours down and trickles down. You guys are off to the side. This whole portion of the floor that crawls up to Emberhold is covered in duergar buildings. It is a small city that surrounds it. She resides somewhere in the center of that."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So we're on the same level as them or are they above us?","response":"DM: They are a little bit above. You guys are at a lower point, as the actual ground you follow curves around and descends."}
{"prompt":"SAM: But once we walk out of here we will be at the same level.\nMARISHA: I have a theory. I've a new skill that I've recently learned and was practicing a lot when I was with the Earth Ashari while we were gone for the past six months. They taught me the ways of the earth elementals.\nORION: Oh, that's fun.\nMARISHA: So. And as an earth– but I am still new at it.\nASHLEY: That's okay, we all start somewhere.\nMARISHA: Thank you, Pike.\nASHLEY: You're welcome.\nMARISHA: Thank you. I mean I am a little self-conscious about it still, but I can travel through the earth.\nLAURA: And pop up, perhaps, where she is?\nORION: (Dwarven accent) Ooh, like a little gopher.\nLAURA: All of us? Or just you?\nMARISHA: It is not a burrowing thing, right?","response":"DM: You glide through the earth."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: More like a Shadowcat kind of thing?","response":"DM: Essentially."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it all of us or just you?\nMARISHA: Just me. But I could get inside.\nLAURA: Well, but then you will be alone, surrounded by duergar and Grog.\nMARISHA: Well, I am not talking about right now.\nASHLEY: Could we put invisibility on her?\nMARISHA: If we do some sort of flanking thing.\nLIAM: Well that does sound useful.\nTALIESIN: It is. It is going to be useful.\nMARISHA: I am wondering if we can make a tunnel, though. I can theoretically– okay, theoretically we could rest and I could keep all of my spells and use all of my magical focus to tunnel us out, depending on how far we are going. We can do an underground approach\nLIAM: But concretely, right now we need nappies.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: Let's sleep.\nMARISHA: But what if they leave while we sleep?\nLIAM: But we are essentially powerless.\nTALIESIN: And what are we going to do if we find them?\nLAURA: I'm going to only sleep for a little bit, cause I didn't use all my spells I only need to rest for half the amount of time, maybe.","response":"DM: It doesn't work that way."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think we'll be fine. Because she needs to rest as well. We hurt her pretty badly.\nLIAM: I think it is safe to assume she's brought Grog back to her seat of power. Why would she go anywhere else? She's at her strongest where she is.\nTALIESIN: I think they're staying.\nSAM: We're going to rest.\nLIAM: Sleep.\nLAURA: We've got to sleep, Keyleth.\nASHLEY: I know. You're right. I see what you're saying, but we need to…\nSAM: Grog will be fine.\nASHLEY: He's at a two!\nMARISHA: I'm so mad at him. Why'd he get stolen?\nTALIESIN: Brilliant idea.\nLIAM: One last thing before we lay our heads down for the night. Pike, do you have any salve or anything you could help me put on my foot, or could your god help with my little toe?\nMARISHA: I could help you with some natural mediciney stuff, maybe.\nLIAM: It stings a bit.","response":"DM: You have not encountered a person with any sort of physical marring to this degree, necessarily, and those that usually did, it was a permanent thing. So this is something that you would have to experiment with."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Could I try healing? A very concentrated energy just on his foot? A healing spell?","response":"DM: You could certainly try."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You can do it, Pike.\nMARISHA: Is there anyway I could assist her?\nASHLEY: Let's try it.\nMARISHA: Possibly?\nLIAM: I mean a clockwork foot from Percy does sound cool.\nASHLEY: If we're going to rest, it doesn't hurt to try.\nMARISHA: That way we can sleep on it.\nASHLEY: You can sleep on it.\nLIAM: Literally.\nLAURA: Maybe this yellow vial of potion could do something for it as well.\nLIAM: That's Ben-gay.\nASHLEY: I'll try Cure Wounds at, I'll try 4th level, since we're going to sleep.\nASHLEY: So I roll…","response":"DM: 4d8 plus five Is what it would be."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Why do you keep putting your foot up near me?\nLAURA: Can I keep an ear out for anything approaching?","response":"DM: Very much so."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wait, plus my spell caster–","response":"DM: Plus your modifier, which is five."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I start building a positive chi. Like a healing chi ball.\nSAM: Is she doing a standard healing here? Is my song of rest going to help at all?","response":"DM: Your song of rest would actually be of aid to this."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Please do.","response":"DM: All the healers convene, Scanlan begins–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I light some sage.\nSAM AND ASHLEY: Waiting for you.\nLIAM: All that improv school paid off.","response":"DM: As you take the healing energy you've gathered from your own nature-based casting, you infuse the healing spell. You do how many points of healing from the spell?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 27.","response":"DM: 27. Go ahead and make a medicine check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is this what I can maybe assist her with?\nLAURA: It looks really disgusting by the way. It's so gross.\nASHLEY: What do I roll? Do I roll the 20?","response":"DM: Roll a d20, and add your proficiency modifier"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Can I apply my Luck feat to her?\nLAURA: You don't have any feet left.\nSAM: Feet pun!\nASHLEY: 21.","response":"DM: 21. As you finish the spell, you can see where the mostly-gone second small toe has grown to mostly a full toe, and there's a small stub where the little one is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You've got a toe nubbin.\nASHLEY: Hey man, we got a little stub. A little bit.","response":"DM: You're promoting a level of divine regeneration at a very, very slow pace. You've never attempted this before, and there is some progress, but this may be an over time thing you have to do."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Over time, I just keep doing it?","response":"DM: Once a day, you might want to attempt this and eventually he probably will recover. But not immediately."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Until then, he's a gimp.\nLIAM: I think I see Pike's deity in my toenail!\nASHLEY: It's gonna take time. That was just a little manicure that we did real quick.\nMARISHA: We could just own it and call you–\nTALIESIN: Little piggy?\nMARISHA: Well I was going to say Vax the Nine-Toe.\nLIAM: And put a knife on it?\nTALIESIN: Could put a very tiny knife on it.\nLAURA: A teeny tiny little knife.\nTALIESIN: Could actually give you a nail clipper. You could clip your own nails.\nMARISHA: We can get you a prosthetic little toe that has a little compartment for poison.\nLIAM: I would take a brass claw.\nMARISHA: Or a brass claw toe. That's fun. Maybe we could get you a raptor claw. That's cool.\nTALIESIN: Let's sleep.\nSAM: Before we go to sleep, I go over to Kima and I say to her, Lady Kima, I think we're all going to take a rest and you as well, correct?","response":"DM: “I think I should.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We can trust you while we're all asleep not to do anything to any of our companions, correct?","response":"DM: “If you're worried about the mind flayer, I'll be keeping an eye, but nothing beyond that. Remember: he has to make the side-step, the wrong step, before I take any action. Trust and know that if I were to strike a blow, it's at his own poor choice and actions.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: That first part of what you said rhymed.\nSAM: Does she seem to be telling the truth?","response":"DM: Make an insight check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A what? What check?","response":"DM: Insight."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Insight. Okay, 18.","response":"DM: She seems to be true."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.","response":"DM: She is legitimately concerned about Clarota. But also understands that at this moment, it has not done anything to necessarily draw her blade."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Lady Kima, Clarota, may I suggest you take the first watch?\nTALIESIN: So it's going to be that sort of evening, excellent.\nLIAM: Rated M, for mature.","response":"DM: Clarota says, “Should you insist.” And Clarota's image shimmers and vanishes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sweet.\nTALIESIN: I'm falling asleep.","response":"DM: As you guys are all going to sleep, Kima's still sharpening her sword and she stops for a second and goes, “Everyone, I'm sorry you've lost your friend. If he lives, we shall find him.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He will live.\nTALIESIN: And we will find him.\nASHLEY: No, he will, Scanlan! You just calm down.","response":"DM: “But if they have indeed taken him prisoner and Emberhold is lost, there is only one place they would bring him: Yug'Voril.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) With the dude with the black horn.","response":"DM: “Considering the mess that you've made since entering their realm of living and work, you'd make for a great gift to their current standing demigod. If we aren't able to find him within the city, I think that may be the next place to look.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Once again, are you afraid they're going to take him while we're asleep? Is this a genuine concern? Is this something we should move on now?","response":"DM: “Not as long as you're keeping concentration, we should be fine.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm concentrating so hard.\nLIAM: We're busted up.\nTALIESIN: There's legitimately nothing to be done.","response":"DM: There's a softness that hits Kima's face and you can see a bit of a quiver to her chin and she goes, “The guilt I feel for unknowingly putting you all in danger for my sake is immense. It's because of me and my actions that you even delved this far and nearly lost life and limb, merely at the behest of Allura and… I want you all to know that I appreciate it. I really, truly do.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's great. If you can mention that to Allura, that'd be wonderful.","response":"DM: “I would really appreciate it to speak to Tiberius.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: (mumbles, makes spell sounds, returns to normal voice) I would really appreciate it if you mentioned that to Allura. I'm trying to get into her good graces and whatnot.\nORION: We share something in common, Lady Kima. I, too, have left my home and land because I did not want to sit on the council of Draconia. With blessings from my father and such, I gained ambassadorship on a mission for them, but really, just so I could–","response":"DM: Her eyes have glazed over and are staring off into the distance."}
{"prompt":"ORION: To get all the things out, and I saw this wonderful lamb in this field one time–","response":"DM: “I was speak to Allura of your honor and deeds, Tiberius. We try to have drinks and swap stories every few months. She's a good one.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, I think so.","response":"DM: She takes a moment to herself and looks around at the rest of you and says, “The cruel king. Who dealt the final blow?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (clears throat) That would be the kingslayer. Me.","response":"DM: She steps up and walks over to you and puts a hand on your shoulder and gives you a stern look in the eye and shakes your shoulder. She's a halfling, so she's not too much taller than you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Are you congratulating us for being murderers? Is that what you're doing right now?","response":"DM: “Murder and justice are two entirely different things and the deities of all good saw to it that this King's time was limited.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Are you suggesting now that we control the wills of the deities?","response":"DM: “No, but we enact them, as long as we work within your plans to keep us safe.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's mighty bold and presumptuous of you.","response":"DM: “My life has been given to guidance of the platinum dragon, who has not seen nothing but the positive direction for all of your species, mine and the rest of humanity, that exists in the material plane. You would do well to not disrespect one who looks out for you, even though you may not look up to him for guidance. The reason these lands that you grew up in are safe and free, as much as they are, are because of the sacrifices of my brethren who came before me under his light and guidance. I'm not saying you to worship him– each one has their own gods of choice. I just say, show some respect.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I do show respect, Lady Kima. I show respect when I feel that respect has been earned.\nORION: She's royalty, you have to understand.\nSAM: We're all a bit cranky. Maybe we should just turn in.\nMARISHA: Lady Kima, I am not saying that what we are doing here is not just. I only wish that you understand– and I humbly thank you for your appreciation and thanks for coming down here to rescue you. But you are correct. We have lost a friend. Someone who we have been through a lot with, way more than we have been with you. So. Before we start boasting congratulations and you start thanking us, why don't you wait? And we'll see what happens when we all get out of here first.\nLIAM: She's suffering from PTSD. Why are you poking the badger?\nLAURA: Maybe we should just calm down and go to sleep.","response":"DM: Kima takes a step forward towards Keyleth. And as you look up at her face, there's a tension, but you can see now that she's stepped near in to you, towards what little bit of light seems to cascade through this cavern, there are tears streaking down her face."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How do you feel now?","response":"DM: “They tried all they could to break me, but I knew my destiny would not end here. I have a destiny that does not end here.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I reach out really slowly and give her a handkerchief.\nASHLEY: And then retreat.\nTALIESIN: Lady Kima, as I'm sure you know, grief speaks before sense.\nMARISHA: All I'm saying, Lady Kima, is that after what we have done and what we have been through and the lives and the blood that even I have on my hands, you had better be worth it.\nTALIESIN: Let us wait for talk of worth and talk of might until we are reunited.","response":"DM: She puts a hand up towards you. “Child, let me explain to you why we are here. As while you may have stepped into the pretense of keeping me out of harm's way, there is a purpose that I and now all of us serve, here in the Underdark. Now, I've been on this journey for more than a year, traveling wherever the wind took me, finding where my gift would find an end to suffering, justice to the wicked and comfort to the downtrodden. I'd just returned from the frozen tundra northeast of these Cliffkeep mountains, heading to meet with Allura, the same friend who brought you here.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I pop out of my sleep. Did you say Allura again?","response":"DM: “Shh.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm sorry.\nLAURA: Tiberius. Shh.","response":"DM: “My vision came to me. I'm sure you're familiar with visions. The great platinum dragon bestowed upon my humble self a dream. I saw an ancient vision of the great and terrible god of undeath himself: Orcus. His crimson, leathery skin and endless wings rumbling through the Abyss itself. He had chosen a champion, one that would unite the material world and the heart of the Abyss, bringing a doorway of oblivion to our world. He cut from his own head two of his terrible black horns, placing them upon the brow of this chosen warrior, his avatar to these realms, granting him power no mortal should ever have. I saw heroes, long forgotten, rise up to destroy this shadow champion, losing much in the ensuing battle. Loss, far more than you or I will ever know. The body of the avatar was burned away,  but the horns of Orcus remained. Untouched by flame, blade, nor divine judgement. These keepers of the horns had a title that time has taken and the whereabouts of the artifacts that had been, thankfully, lost as well. Until the next dream dispelled my confusion. I felt a cackling entity of immense power, who had discovered one of the holding vaults, never meant to be found. This creature obsessed, spent all their attention to unlock the promised treasure within and over time, they did. One of the two horns had found a new champion, one who now resides deeper within the Underdark here. One we've now known to be called K'varn. This one who has united the illithid and the duergar alike under a banner of madness, expansion, and mockery of life. I've seen these experiments, as have you. This is what I came down here to dispose of, once and for all. Now, I hired some of the finest warriors in Kraghammer for this, all of whom have been slain or worse. That guilt weighs upon my soul. And this very quest, whoever this K'varn monstrosity, it holds the horn of Orcus upon its brow. My visions have told me that we must destroy it and must do so soon. If it had already unlocked the artifact's true potential, Kraghammer would be a ruin before you even arrived. But it's only a matter of time. We must end K'Varn and retrieve this horn and return it to the Tal'Dorei council to discuss how to seal it once more, hopefully for all of eternity. Your friend's loss is a terrible thing, but we will try to find him and should we not, understand that his sacrifice was not in vain. For we're here not to save one, but thousands, hundreds of thousands of lives, if we succeed. So we sleep, we rest, we find your friend and we destroy this, this abomination, this anathema.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Lady Kima, I only hope you do not eventually become what you fear so much. Good night.\nSAM: Sleep tight.","response":"DM: She picks up her blade, sits back down and goes back to sharpening (sounds of a sharpening stone hitting blade)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That was weird, right? Good night.\nTALIESIN: That went well.\nSAM: Pike, I'll cuddle you for warmth, if that would help?\nASHLEY: It's already so hot in here with all the lava and stuff, I would just prefer to sleep alone. I'm sorry.\nSAM: That's fine. That's what I meant.\nMARISHA: I turn into Minxie form and go off in the corner and curl up in the corner.\nLIAM: Scanlan, I'm very cold.\nSAM: You know what? We better let that foot heal. We better let it heal.\nLAURA: Trinket, go sleep with Vax.\nLIAM: That's a good idea. Come here, Trinky. Trink!","response":"DM: (bear sounds and sniffing)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Who wants nibbles?","response":"DM: Trinket comes up and curls next to you. The evening goes by, uneventful. Occasionally, you stumble out of your rest, keep an eye out. The beacon still resides. From what you can imagine, a natural body sleep cycle that you're used to passes. A few begin to wake up before the others, as you have no daylight to ascertain whether it is day or night. Indeed, who knows what it is at this point."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I relieved myself in the middle of the night.\nLAURA: Thank you for telling us, Tiberius.\nSAM: Did you get up?","response":"DM: Just wake up in a puddle of his own dragonborn filth?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I did my dragonborn business and buried it. As we do.\nLAURA: So have we healed completely?","response":"DM: Yes, you've all healed completely at this point. You had an evening's rest."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do we get all our spells back and stuff?","response":"DM: You get your spells back."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We have to pick them for the day, right?\nSAM: I can do things again.\nMARISHA: Yeah, hang on, got to think about this.\nORION: Put some Greater Restorations in there.","response":"DM: Your mark? Wait, your mark, your Hunter's Mark, which you can feel, the magic of it is slowly waning as the spell comes to the end of its effective period, is moving."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) Where's it moving?","response":"DM: It's moving out of the city."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where, which direction?","response":"DM: Best you can tell, it's heading towards the opposite side of the cavern towards where it curves down, deeper and below."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait. Where is that in relation to us?","response":"DM: To where you guys are? If you're looking out from next to the Emberhold, it's to your right, curving down and around."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should go that direction.\nMARISHA: I go and cast Pass Without a Trace on us.\nLIAM: This is suddenly turning into Labyrinth. “Beyond the Goblin city…”","response":"DM: To take back the child, which you have stolen."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You have no power over me.\nSAM: The way we came in the city was through the side path, right?","response":"DM: Yes, the side of Emberhold, which you followed the curvature of this giant cavern around and you slept on the side, up against the wall, using the illusion, the illusory terrain."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So we're already–","response":"DM: You're already away from Emberhold, you're on the side of the wall, maybe about a quarter to a half a mile further down."}
{"prompt":"SAM: But if we keep going, we'll get to the–","response":"DM: You'll head down further into the cavern, seemingly in the direction where her Hunter's Mark is currently leading, which has now faded."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay! Your Hunter's Mark is gone.\nLAURA: Well, it went that way. We should go.\nSAM: So, let's go. Let's just hurry.\nLAURA: As stealthily as possible so we don't alert the entire freaking camp.\nLAURA: I try to make it look like we weren't around this area as much as possible without our Dust of Tracelessness.","response":"DM: You're sweeping behind the group as they're all moving along. With your imaginary brush."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Trinket's doing that thing where he pulls with his front feet and drags with his behind.\nTALIESIN: He's just rolling like a giant brillo brush.\nMARISHA: I put Stone Shape in my Ring of Holding last night with my unused spells. I meant to tell you that last night.\nASHLEY: Oh, I forgot you had that ring.\nORION: I take out my Ioun Stones.","response":"DM: Okay, so your Ioun Stones are now slowly rotating around your head. Well, you can only have one up at a time."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, I only have one.","response":"DM: Yeah, okay, good. You said stones, so."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sorry. Pathfinder habit.\nLAURA: So technically, Lady Kima, we might be able to get back in eventually and get your weapon.","response":"DM: As you say that, she grins to herself and says, “I would like that very much. I had some sentimental value to that equipment.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And there's a vault.","response":"DM: “And there is a vault.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Unless it melted.\nLIAM: This will greatly enhance your ability to move forward with us, won't it?","response":"DM: “I think right now time is of the essence for your friend more than anything.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should go look for Grog.","response":"DM: “Besides, I highly doubt that that stronghold has been left alone, just because it's filled with rock.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Maybe on the way out.","response":"DM: Okay, so as you guys progress on the side, I would like everybody to roll a stealth check, please."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I don't know which one to roll.","response":"DM: You still have disadvantage, but you have advantage with your cloak, so you're neutralized. You're a normal roll right now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (softly) Stealth check.\nASHLEY: We have advantage?\nMARISHA: You have plus ten.","response":"DM: No, you have disadvantage still."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I do not. There's no plus anything?\nSAM: Plus ten.\nASHLEY: Ten still?\nORION: 29.\nLIAM: Plus ten?","response":"DM: Plus ten."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 29.\nSAM: 19.\nMARISHA: 33.\nTALIESIN: 17.\nASHLEY: 21.\nLAURA: 24.\nLIAM: 33.\nLAURA: Oh, I didn't roll for Trinket. Hold on.\nLIAM: Oh, Trinket rolled a one.\nLAURA: Trinket, shush. Oh, I didn't feed him today, he's probably so hungry.\nSAM: Have any of us eaten?\nASHLEY: We've rested.","response":"DM: Essentially, as opposed to having this minutiae of reminding you all to eat, I just consider when you rest and take short rests, you're snacking and resting. Otherwise, we communally spend ten minutes a game talking about what you ate. If food begins to become scarce, which it may in time, I'll let you know."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Foot flakes anyone? Foot flakes?\nLAURA: Fresh-ish?","response":"DM: Fresh-ish blood, if you will. You smell fresh-ish blood. You immediately glance over and you can see on the side of this cavern, which is about 50, 60 feet wide at this point, as it's come to a pinching point leading downward, you can see a spatter of blood across the wall to your immediate left, and what looks like a mangled mass of what once was a duergar, currently just torn asunder across this rock wall."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.\nMARISHA: Does it look to be natural, done by an animal? Or does it look like people with weapons?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The only time I've seen duergar split across like this was when we saw the camp of that creepy centipede creature.\nLIAM: With the stalagmite coming up?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Ten.\nLAURA: Do I see any of those kind of tracks around?","response":"DM: You check and look around on the ground as well, you unfortunately, as you look around, you're not able to pick up the fine details. You, however, just being naturally understanding of the Underdark, as well as having the previous knowledge of inspecting the initial camp: yes, these tracks are very similar. You see what looks like these strange dragging marks on the ground, these elongated ones. No footprints. Occasionally you see what looks like a human-sized footprint as well, and then these drag marks. You also notice that there is just beyond the rock threshold, as you step over towards the wall, you see three other duergar bodies that are torn asunder. Many of them partially eaten and violently torn apart. Some parts are scarred, some sort of acidic burn, and you see tooth marks, you see claw marks and you see portions of limbs that have been pulled off by sheer force."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Could I do a nature check to see if I would know of a creature that could do this?","response":"DM: You certainly can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's going to be that centipede creature thingy.\nMARISHA: Ooh. 26.","response":"DM: 26. It's weird. There are elements of the drag marks on the ground that resemble a creature that has pseudopods or some sort of a tentacle-like mass, but you know of no natural creature that also has this power, this type of hunting technique, nor would be this far underground."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I think it's another stitch monster.\nLIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: Stitch monster.\nTALIESIN: Stitch monster.\nLAURA: I like it.\nTALIESIN: I do, too.\nLAURA: It's a good name.\nMARISHA: Something tentacle-y though. Nothing ever good is tentacle-y.\nLAURA: Can I tell if Grog definitely came this way?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a tracking check, so just go ahead and roll a d20. You have advantage, because you're in the Underdark."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What do I add that to?","response":"DM: It should be under your tracking ability under your ranger abilities there. In your spells, under you ranger abilities. I'll see if I find it before you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't understand.","response":"DM: It's on the sheet I gave you, with all your character stuff."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh. Okay, cool.","response":"DM: That one. The one that's easiest."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Natural explorer, primeval awareness.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't have any idea what I'm looking for.\nLAURA: I'm just looking at words right now.","response":"DM: It's a survival check. There you go."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's a survival check.","response":"DM: You have advantage on it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Oh, good. So that's 22.\nLAURA: Two grooves?","response":"DM: About two-inch-wide grooves that continue down the path."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I wonder if they have him prisoner now. If he came out of his mind funk.\nMARISHA: Wheel tracks?","response":"DM: It could very well be wheel tracks."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Or they're dragging his body.","response":"DM: They're consistent and their width is consistent."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Their width is consistent? And they seem clean?\nSAM: They've put him on some sort of stretcher thing.\nMARISHA: Yeah, sounds like they have him on, yeah, a trailer.\nLAURA: Lovely. Well, Grog definitely came this way. As did the stitch monster, so you don't have much choice but to follow.\nTALIESIN: Let's continue.\nORION: Shall we?\nLAURA: Be aware. We're all very aware of–\nMARISHA: Things.\nLAURA: Any movement at all… happening.\nTALIESIN: Guys, stuff.","response":"DM: Keeping your eyes peeled, you travel for another two and a half hours down this cavern path. It grows tighter at points where you can only really fit three or four individuals through, it's about 20, 25 feet wide, then opens up sporadically into other small pockets, where the natural topography of this portion of this Underdark cavern structure seems to weave and bend. The warmth and that sulfurous smell that was intrinsic to the duergar portion of this cavern that you were so used to, begins to slowly fade and temperature begins to drop. Still uncomfortable, but it's growing more humid as opposed to dry heat."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's so good.","response":"DM: After another hour of travel, keeping your eyes out, the temperature drops significantly and is actually quite cold. The heat in the volcanic portion of this cavern structure apparently has passed you now, and you've hit an area of the rock where it is a much more chilled, much more ominous–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's humid still?","response":"DM: Human?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Humid.","response":"DM: Humid? The humidity begins to fade as well. The air becomes a dry cold."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So we're past that.","response":"DM: You eventually using, which by the way the only light source you have going forward is the light from your staff."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, Light!","response":"DM: I assume you've had it up this whole time or you've been walking in the darkness."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, yes, of course.","response":"DM: (chuckles) You continue down and the topography, which was once the black, jagged obsidian flooring of the previous portion of the Underdark, begins to give way to a more natural gray sand-type texture. Your feet sink about a quarter inch or so with each step, and you get about ten, 15 feet before the color of the sand and the texture changes dramatically. It looks almost like a peppering of small whitish-yellow stones and rocks, as well as bits of black and grey. It's like a giant, rocky pit out in front of you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What?\nLIAM: Meaning it's all solid stone that color or loose gravel and rock?","response":"DM: You find sand and then the sand eventually gives way to like larger pieces of these rocks and stones."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So it's like a pebble ball pit in front of us?","response":"DM: Essentially."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm looking for signs of mining.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to make an arcana check, also.\nTALIESIN: 15.","response":"DM: 15. Checking the walls immediately in your vicinity, you see there are signs of mining, but they're old, they haven't been used in a while. You can see some veins that are dried up. Looks like maybe the duergar had business down here mining."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Does it look like there– Can I do a nature check to see if this is an old lake bed? Like there is a river bed?","response":"DM: Sure, go and do that. What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 11.","response":"DM: What are you checking?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: For arcana.","response":"DM: What are you checking?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Just general, if I feel a general source of sinister magic anywhere.","response":"DM: Nothing arcane seems to emanate from the vicinity."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Vex'ahlia, you know the Underdark. Are there any critters crawling around in that pit?\nLAURA: Is this still the Underdark?","response":"DM: You seem to be still in the Underdark, but the Underdark in general you're familiar with; your training and studying on the denizens of it, what things to look for. This is not a natural or overall occurrence you've read about before."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I can't sense anything or any creatures nearby?","response":"DM: Not per se."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I rolled a 16.","response":"DM: Rolled a 16? As you're looking around, you go and inspect the stones. What you do notice is, they're not stones. There are pieces of glass, little shards of actual volcanic glass scattered across this entire field mixed with an endless seemingly sea of small bone chunks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh!\nMARISHA: Chunks?\nLAURA: Great!","response":"DM: Pieces of bone that have been rounded off, ground, broken."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Bone petals.","response":"DM: They're ancient."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, so there appears to be– are there any whole pieces of bones? Big femurs or skulls?\nSAM: This was some sort of burial ground.","response":"DM: It's hard to see. Most of the bones that have been here, have been around long enough to the point where they've eroded, been broken, destroyed over and over again to the point where you can't discern any of the original creatures they may have come from. It's just a sea of bone, obsidian glass, and small bits of stone that have fallen from the actual nearby cavern."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Can we see any sort of civilized construction here? Or is this all the work of nature or some living thing?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 18.","response":"DM: 18? You look past the barrier of his light spell, because you can only get a little bit past that due to your elven low-light vision. You do notice there are occasionally some spires of natural rock, some stalagmites that are jutting out in the distance, and you see what looks like some semblance of a ruined wall just beyond the edge of the vision. Like a crumbled, small wall."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I use my primeval awareness and see if I can sense Grog within six miles of us?\nLAURA: Oh, I can use an action to focus my awareness on a region around me and then I can sense whether– oh, well, no. It's only certain types of creatures.","response":"DM: Right. Which are?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Like goliath?\nLAURA: Well, no. It says “aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead”.\nLIAM: That still might be useful, even if it doesn't find Grog.","response":"DM: What you do gather, you do sense a very strong force of aberration-based, much further, like five miles ahead, way ahead, and you have this weird, “Okay, good to know.” You don't sense anything else, but you do sense a general presence about this entire sea of bone."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I've been here!\nMARISHA: What?!\nASHLEY: I was here in the vision.\nLAURA: Really?\nASHLEY: Yes, it was a field of broken glass and bone, and I feel like this is it.\nLAURA: So what do we do?\nASHLEY: And then after that, I got to a cavern of blue crystal.\nLAURA: So we have to go beyond it.\nMARISHA: So we're on the right road.\nASHLEY: I think we have to go beyond this.\nORION: Well, let's keep moving, then.\nLAURA: Can we keep to the edge and try to not disturb the rock as much as possible.\nLIAM: Could you describe the dimensions of this one more time?","response":"DM: Yes. The cavern itself is about 120 to 150 feet wide. You don't see the ceiling right now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, it's that high?\nLIAM: So, from our left to our right, 150 feet?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And is it a big circular shape?","response":"DM: From what you can tell, it just opens up and then continues and then darkness. You cannot see beyond it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are there any rocks around us? Any big rocks?","response":"DM: There are a couple of small spires about 60, 70 feet out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Anything loose? Anything I can grab near us?","response":"DM: Around you? Most everything that's grab-able are part of it, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: We don't have the magic carpet. So never mind.\nSAM: What, do you want to fly?\nLIAM: I say we take a wall.\nTALIESIN: Say we just gingerly try and cross against a wall.\nLAURA: Yeah. Anything to throw as far as I can out and see if it–","response":"DM: You look around and find a small pebble, and you chuck it (sound of pebble flying through air and landing) It arcs around, bounces a bit, and comes to rest."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's just go.\nMARISHA: No! No, I'm not touching that. Nope.\nSAM: What are we going to do? Turn around? Grog's that way.\nMARISHA: Okay, here's my idea. We've got that immovable rod.\nORION: Yes, I know where you're going with this, and we'd all have to make a certain–","response":"DM: Once again, there's something about this whole area, there's a presence about it. It's ominous, and everywhere about this floor."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't want to touch this. I feel like we should go over it.\nASHLEY: What if these bones come to life?\nLAURA: Can you send your light source up? Can anybody send light up and see how high the ceiling goes?\nORION: (mumbles) Shoot an arrow, if you would, Vex, please? Wherever you wish.\nLAURA: Okay.\nORION: Light!","response":"DM: Okay, cast out an arrow. As it shoots over, arcs through the air. You get a look of the cavern. You can see it's a large, arched,  natural cavern with a number of hanging stalactites at the top. It goes up, arcs past, and then lands probably about a half a mile down the way. Really nice shot."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Thanks.","response":"DM: And it lands with a (impact noise). With what little bit you can see through the arc, this path just continues and continues and continues for that full half mile."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: There's no way to avoid it.\nMARISHA: There's no way to avoid it.","response":"DM: You do get a nice view of what looks to be more of these little, central pieces of broken wall. Looks like there was either a small series of structures or buildings that were built once within this cavern that have all completely crumbled to ruin with but a few small bastions of foundation that still remain."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Tiberius, how many times can you cast pillars of… whatever? Pillars.\nORION: Grand Columns is the spell, Vex.\nLAURA: How many times can you cast Grand Columns?\nORION: Multiple times, I guess.\nLAURA: Could we potentially walk on columns across this thing? Potentially.\nMARISHA: I mean, I could wall of– bend us a stone wall that's and we could just walk along the path. But it goes only so far.\nORION: Hold on a second. I've got something here.\nLIAM: We're seeing the remains of buildings scattered throughout, maybe we could go from–\nLAURA: What about a wall from out from the side?\nMARISHA: The side? And then we walk along that side?\nLAURA: Yeah!\nMARISHA: Yeah, we could do that, right?","response":"DM: How big is the wall you can make?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What were you going to say?\nLIAM: Well, there's little islands of structure left, we could just–\nLAURA: Hop.\nLIAM: Stand bridge, stand bridge, stand bridge.\nMARISHA: I can go 120 feet. I can make about 120 feet wall.","response":"DM: You saw about a quarter to a half mile. This seems to continue."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So, that might not be enough.\nSAM: She'd have to do it 20 times.\nTALIESIN: I think we may just have to walk gingerly.\nMARISHA: Maybe we can fashion–\nASHLEY: Should we find traps? Check for traps?\nMARISHA: Can we fashion snow boots?\nLIAM: Vax starts feeling along one side of the wall. Does the ground look firm and more stable on the edges? Or is it all just the same?","response":"DM: Do you step out a little bit into the area?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hand on the wall.","response":"DM: Hand on the wall? I mean, it's a wall."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, but I mean– yes.","response":"DM: But you step out with your hand on the wall."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm not stepping out yet. I'm looking at the ground. Is it pebbles and rock all the way to the sides?","response":"DM: All the way up to the wall."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nORION: Lady Keyleth, if you will, could you perhaps make a flat, sturdy stone tablet we could all particularly stand on.\nMARISHA: Sure.\nORION: Make sure it's under a hundred pounds, if you could. Or actually, two hundred pounds, a little bit more to work with.\nMARISHA: I use Stone Shape and I bend down and make a big circle where I am. Carve out a little cylinder with Stone Shape.\nMARISHA: Disc.","response":"DM: Disc-like platform, that's (boof) on the ground, right at the base of the platform."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Everybody, hop on.\nLAURA: Trinket, hop on this rock.\nORION: Wait a minute, how much does Trinket weigh?\nLAURA: A lot.\nLIAM: Is it 200?","response":"DM: Trinket weighs more than that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Trinket weighs a ton. All of us together.\nMARISHA: Maybe you could just levitate Trinket behind?\nORION: I don't have that spell anymore. I need to know how much she weighs for this.","response":"DM: Trinket, I mean, looking at it, you haven't really weighed her yourself, you gather–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket's a boy!","response":"DM: Trinket weighs approximately–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Trinket's a boy?! With a name like Trinket?\nLIAM: Haven't you seen his wang flopping around under his tail?","response":"DM: Trinket's probably close to a thousand."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So here's the situation. I can get us all across, but I cannot take Trinket as well.\nLAURA: I'm not leaving Trinket behind. So everybody get on that and we'll see what happens.\nSAM: Why don't we go across. He can come back and get Trinket.\nLAURA: Okay, yeah. How about you guys go and I'll stay with Trinket. You guys go.\nLIAM: Well, I'm not going to leave her.\nMARISHA: Can we make him weightless and then tug him along with the rope? We can't do that?\nASHLEY: I have a question. How many feet across?\nLAURA: It's like half a mile.","response":"DM: Quarter to a half mile from what you can tell, like I said, you only have vision enough to where the arrow arced and it was a very long arc, that just trailed off so you gather anywhere between a quarter to a half mile."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I want to run across.\nSAM: With your heavy armor.\nLIAM: Sneak right in there.\nLAURA: Oh, just do it.\nASHLEY: Wait, are we getting on the rock?\nLIAM: How far is the closest little island of remaining structure that you referenced?","response":"DM: Oh it's probably about 60, 70 feet out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't sense any undead with my primal awareness do I?","response":"DM: The perpetual presence that you sense across the entirety of this bed of bone and glass, if you had to describe it, it has some sort of undead-ish realm. It's not your specialty, I mean it is, like undead creatures are, and the presence is similar to that."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I get my Mace of Disruption ready.\nLAURA: Oh, and Kima!\nMARISHA: (gasps) Oh! We're done! We can do this! We polymorph Trinket!\nORION: That's it, yes!\nMARISHA: We polymorph Trinket!\nORION: Very good.\nASHLEY: Into a tiny tiny?\nORION: Make him into a chicken.","response":"DM: You instinctively glance around, you look down, and you notice your holy symbol of Sarenrae has a hairline fracture in it. What was once a perfect and impeccable sphere of design– you've had this your entire life, you look down and see, you don't know how recently, but a portion of the metal symbol itself is cracked."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, Pike.\nASHLEY: Oh no, this is terrible.\nLAURA: Pike, pray! do something!\nORION: I motion over to Pike and I take her medallion slowly off of her and go– and bring out my Mending Wheel.","response":"DM: Your Mending Wheel, which was where? It was in the Bag of Holding."}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, I held that.","response":"DM: The Mending Wheel's this big. You haven't been carrying it with you this entire time!"}
{"prompt":"ORION: What? I thought it was like this big.\nASHLEY: I'll take my symbol back, put it back on, and say, this is something that I've got to– this is something I need to deal with. We can't just put it in a Mending Wheel.\nLIAM: The gods reward deeds, not words.\nASHLEY: Yes.\nMARISHA: Maybe it happened in the fight.\nASHLEY: I think I know why it happened.\nSAM: Maybe because you've been killing unarmed people?\nASHLEY: I think it was when I slit the guy's throat. She got mad. Just a hunch.\nSAM: But you know what? We'll do some good deeds when we're done.\nASHLEY: Yeah. This is something that I need to fix, but thank you for trying.\nORION: I forgot we didn't have it.\nLAURA: Well, Trinket, what do you want to be? A lizard? A mouse?","response":"DM: (bear noises)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: A kitten? (gasps) A kitten.\nASHLEY: A little kitty.\nLAURA: You want to be a kitten?\nMARISHA: And I go (floop), and I make him a kitten. What kind of kitten?\nLAURA: Oh, he's a Persian.\nMARISHA: He's a Persian kitten.","response":"DM: Trinket's form (shwoop) shifts down into this tiny white puffball with a pushed-in nose."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You're the cutest, Trinket.\nASHLEY: I go and I snuggle, and I nuzzle him.\nLAURA: I tuck him into my shirt.","response":"DM: You sense immediately, Trinket is not necessarily pleased, but will deal with it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well, he's so cute.\nLAURA: He's so cute.\nORION: In Draconia, those are snacks.\nSAM: I wouldn't say that.\nLAURA: Let's go! Come on! Let's get on this thing! Grog's getting ahead of us.\nMARISHA: Let's get on the Wonkavator, everybody.\nORION: I cast Telekinesis on the stone slab, lift us up, and push us.","response":"DM: Okay, how much weight can you push through Telekinesis?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: A thousand.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I did all the math. (clears throat) Vax weighs 155, Pike weighs 75. Taliesin weighs 190, Vex weighs 120.\nASHLEY: But Scanlan weighs nothing.\nORION: Sam weighs the same, 75. Keyleth weighs 125.","response":"DM: Yep. Kima weighs 105. With all of her armor, she'd be 105."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Clarota can float.","response":"DM: Clarota can float. Does that still fall under a thousand total?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, should. Is that right?\nSAM: What about you?\nTALIESIN: Plus the rock.\nLAURA: The rock would be less.\nORION: That's why I kept a hundred pounds for that.\nMARISHA: A hundred pounds for the rock.\nLIAM: Want to run those numbers again for the calculator?","response":"DM: Rock's 100 pounds? That's not a lot of stone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's a very thin piece of stone.\nORION: Nine. Nope, we're at nine– we're there. We're at nine-something. You can do all the math, but it's nine-something.\nORION: Ten minutes.\nLAURA: Quick! Float us!","response":"DM: So, as Tiberius begins to concentrate, the stone begins to glide out over this expanse of broken bone and obsidian glass."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I hover about– what's bone break?– around six feet above the air. That's how high I take it.","response":"DM: Okay, so you're cresting about six feet. You have to move it around occasionally to avoid some of the large stalagmites that are jutting out of the bones."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do we see anything? I'm keeping an eye out, see if I see any movement or anything that's maybe sparkles. I don't know.\nTALIESIN: Keeping an eye behind us, as well.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys, keeping an eye out, you see more and more of this ruin, and you can see the further in you go, you start seeing bits of bone that are larger than what's near the edge. You start seeing bits and pieces that are full bones, so they've been more– still rounded and weathered, but they're less ground down as supposed to the edges where most of the traction seems to be. You get about 300 feet out before you hear a loud, echoing scream across the cavern. (loud yell)"}
{"prompt":"ORION: In front of us?","response":"DM: In front of you guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What's it sound like?","response":"DM: It's male, and it's loud."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Go! Can we go faster?\nORION: We hear this. I push us forward. I mean, we're going in that direction anyways, so I speed us up.\nLIAM: Keyleth, take the gnomes!","response":"DM: Correct, okay. As you speed up and continue–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I jump on Keyleth.\nLIAM: Take the gnomes!","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Grab some feathers.\nSAM: I'll grab on as well. Why not.\nORION: Cool, so I get a little bit more control over it now. (grunts)","response":"DM: A little bit more. As you're pushing forward you feel the stone itself has this weird wobble to it, but you still manage to keep concentration, pushing forward. Eventually, the little bit of light from your Light spell cascades past one of these joining parts of a wall, and then beyond that you can see what looks like a few other stone pillars that are sticking up. And you see what looks to be a small party of duergar that are in the middle of battle. There is one duergar who is splattered across the bone floor. You see a troll that is currently in the middle of a fistfight with something that's moving extremely fast. This blur of motion. You can barely make out the physical form before the troll turns and runs in your direction, surprised to see the light coming towards you, and in its expression of extreme confusion and fear, you see something (whoosh) past, and its head just (soft falling sound). Rolls off the top of his shoulders."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's not Grog! We're going to toward a monster!","response":"DM: (crashing sound) The troll body hits the ground. As it does you see bits of bone begin to rise up and pull the troll down underneath."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, it's really good we're not standing on it!\nORION: Avoid! (whooshing sound)\nLIAM: Daggers out.\nTALIESIN: Guns out.","response":"DM: As you guys begin to push forward you can see two of the duergar are now backing up instinctually. One looks down at his feet now that have been grabbed, and he's being pulled under, and he just starts trying to wrestle himself free. This blur of motion jumps off one of the platforms, spins in the air, and lands with a slam that completely splatters across the rock that he's right next to. This duergar, you can see part of his jaw go flying off to the side and silence hits him in the middle of his scream. The last duergar there, you can see who's looking around, sees the stone platform, and goes, “Let me on! Let me on!” He goes running over and is trying to jump up towards the stone platform you guys are on."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How much does he weigh? (giggles)","response":"DM: Well, he's going to go ahead and try and grab it with an athletics check– he makes it! (latching noise) He gets onto the side."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Kick him off!\nMARISHA: Fuck that guy!\nLAURA: I punch him in the face!","response":"DM: Okay, okay. You go ahead and (punch thud noise). You just beat him in the face. He holds tight. You're not a very strong person, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I grab him by the cloak. What is it? What is it?","response":"DM: “I don't know! Get it away! Get it away!”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: In eagle form, I'm going to do a nice high soaring lap.\nSAM: We're on you!\nMARISHA: I know! It's okay! I'm going to use my– I'm soaring high. It's an easy breeze. We're on the people mover. Okay. And I'm going to use my keen sight to see if I can get a good… (pew)","response":"DM: Okay, so, using that you glance down and in this brief moment where it seems like the cacophony of this entire circumstance slows down (slowing sound noise). And your eagle eyes glance down, and you can see in a brief moment the blur stops. You see a humanoid form. Looking at the body and the torso, it looks elven. Its very thin and gaunt legs dangling as four giant, jagged-looking tentacles sprout from both sides of its torso, holding it aloft. Two lifting it off the ground and keeping its body suspended, while two are (fwhoosh) whipping around in the process. As you're glancing, you see its head (cracking noise) glance up toward the wall. These blank, white eyes shooting around in different directions spontaneously, with this maddening look. Whatever this is is clearly insane and is currently driven on some sort of hunger bloodlust. The stitch marks you see across its body are very reminiscent of the earlier abominations that you saw, created by K'varn and sent throughout this cavern structure."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Keyleth's the only one who sees it, though, at this moment?\nORION: Do I see it?","response":"DM: You guys haven't yet. At the moment, you're talking to this dwarf or you're shoving him off the platform."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Can I see it as I'm cruising through? I see him?\nLAURA: We wanted to throw him as far as we could.\nLIAM: Yes, the twins pull him up and one–\nLIAM AND LAURA: Two, three!\nORION: As soon as I do that, I cast True Strike. (ftsssh)\nORION: On him!","response":"DM: On him?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: What it does is, it allows me to see–keep going, I'll tell you. Go ahead.\nLAURA: (whispering) Go faster. Go faster!\nORION: I'm still going! We're still going. I'm not standing and watching.\nSAM: Have we passed it yet?","response":"DM: Everyone roll initiative."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my god, we're going to fight? We're going to fight this thing?\nMARISHA: I was going to say we should try and avoid him. Poop monster.\nLAURA: Oh, god.\nSAM: No, we're floating above it. We've got advantage.\nMARISHA: Do we?\nLAURA: We're all stuck on a single piece of rock.\nORION: Yeah, well, that's the thing.\nSAM: We're fine. One of us has guns.\nLIAM: And we saw the duergar get pulled under by skeletal arms?\nSAM: By the bones.\nLIAM: Yeah, the bones pulled down, right? So it's not just this thing.","response":"DM: I'm using this as the figure for the creature."}
{"prompt":"ORION: By the way, Matthew.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: True Strike. I extend my hand and point a finger at a target. My magic grants me a brief insight into the target's defenses. On my next turn, I gain advantage on my first attack roll against the creature, using that spell as a guide.","response":"DM: Gotcha. So! For the purposes of this, the two gnomes are alongside Keyleth's eagle form."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, we're going to use the little thingy?\nMARISHA: Yeah, are we going to use the levitating thingies?","response":"DM: What? Yes, we are. Let me pull them out right now over here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Levitating thingies!\nMARISHA: Levitating thingies! Makes us look cool.\nTALIESIN: It's been so long.\nLAURA: Ooh, I like it.","response":"DM: There's the rest of you. Although, Trinket is a kitten."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Trinket is a cat.\nTALIESIN: Trinket only has the power of “adorability.”\nLAURA: 21.\nLIAM: 17.\nORION: 18.","response":"DM: 18? 15 to ten?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 12.","response":"DM: Ten to five?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Eight.\nTALIESIN: Eight.\nMARISHA: Team Eight.\nTALIESIN: Boom.","response":"DM: Pike, what did you get?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Four.\nLAURA: Yay!","response":"DM: Okay, yay, Pike, bringing up the rear!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Team Single Digits!\nASHLEY: Team Single Digits!\nTALIESIN: We'll get there.","response":"DM: It uses its quite grand movement of 50 feet to (shh) lumber over to this side, and it gets two attacks with its tentacles, with reach. Actually three attacks."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: On who?","response":"DM: This is going to be at you guys."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I don't need this foot.","response":"DM: This is going to be one at Kima, one at you and one at Tiberius as you are the three currently within its positioning view. First one is going to be at you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: Oh, that is going to be a 14 to hit?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No.\nMARISHA: Here's my question. Is this all happening still over top of the bone pit?","response":"DM: Oh yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: That brings us to Vex."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hunter's Mark!\nLAURA: Right on that guy.","response":"DM: Do it. He is Hunter's Marked and I'm putting this on here as a reminder of your mark."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nTALIESIN: It's so fashionable.","response":"DM: Isn't it though."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to lightning arrow him. Oh, I can't do that because I Hunter's Marked him.","response":"DM: Correct. that was your bonus action."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to Hail of Thorns that guy.\nLAURA: Okay, at level three.","response":"DM: Okay!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Through my Bow of Blazing Bowstring.","response":"DM: Okay, so as you pull back your arrow, you pull it up, you can see the thorns (thoosh) actually grow rather rapidly out of the wood itself and as you pull back, the bowstring itself ignites setting the bow, the shaft of the arrow on fire as well as you release, rolling?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 22.","response":"DM: 22 to hit?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes!\nASHLEY: Yeah.\nLAURA: So then I roll my regular damage plus 3d10?","response":"DM: Correct, plus the fire damage which is 1d10."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, whoa. So 14 for the first.","response":"DM: Okay and then roll technically 4d10 because it's the fire."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 4d10, this is crazy.","response":"DM: Yeah!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Four, 11, 19. 21.","response":"DM: So 21 plus 14?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: 35 points of damage. Nice. So you release (soosh)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh plus Hunter's Mark damage!","response":"DM: Yep, there you go. That's why you did it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Six.","response":"DM: Nice, 41 points of damage in the first attack from the ranger."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Before that ends I go, hop off.\nLAURA: Hop off? No way. I'm not stepping on this bone shit.\nLIAM: There's undead things in there\nLAURA: That's my turn.","response":"DM: And that's your turn, and you're holding a kitten."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh he's tucked into my armor.","response":"DM: Oh, he's tucked into you? Okay. That brings us to Tiberius, you're up. Tiberius, what are you doing."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Tibber-hoods.","response":"DM: What you got?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, everyone hold on tight.\nSAM: You're giving us opposite notes.","response":"DM: What you got?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: How wide was the stone tablet? Ten feet for all of us to fit on?","response":"DM: It's about 15 feet round."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Perfect, I move us right above the butthole and, everybody hold on. And I fucking slam all of us right on him. (boosh)","response":"DM: Okay. So the platform comes cascading down at a fair speed immediately breaking over this creature, as it is a pretty thin wall to have only been about 100 pounds. It completely shatters over the top of it. Everyone who was on that platform, go ahead and make a dexterity check."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Get it, guys. Come on.\nLAURA: I get two because it's favored terrain, right?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, okay good.\nLIAM: 17.\nLAURA: 23.","response":"DM: Oh, Pike's not there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 24.\nASHLEY: I'm not happening for a while.\nORION: Me too?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 12.\nORION: Wait, do I make a dexterity check? I mean I'm not– okay.","response":"DM: You do. You're still on the platform. It just shattered around you. So you however fall prone on the ground from the impact and land on the ground. That's also going to end your turn."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Did it do any damage?\nORION: Can I not do any bonus actions?","response":"DM: Unfortunately not, due to the failed dexterity save. It practically knocked the wind out of you due to the impact."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay.","response":"DM: That was the unfortunate part of missing that dexterity check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay.","response":"DM: However, it does deal from the crushing damage to the entity that'll be I'll say 3d10 points of damage. I'll see if it makes its save to reduce to half. Which it does. Rolled a 21. What's your DC in your spell?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17.","response":"DM: So it makes its save, so it's half damage. Roll 3d10 and it's half that."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (counting noises) What is that, 19.","response":"DM: Your Boot of Haste."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Boot of Haste? But aren't magic items resistant to–","response":"DM: Oh yeah I was messing around."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, yeah. Start sneak attack from behind. 32 for the first attack.","response":"DM: You unfortunately do not get sneak attack on this. It knows where you are. You do not get the round before it– nobody else is adjacent to it because everyone else had to jump off the platform."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So no one's right next to it? I'm the closest one?","response":"DM: Currently no. You are the closest one to it because everyone had to jump off as it fell, and the fact that as soon as you rush towards it, its head (cracking noise) clicked over its back and looked straight at you, almost the neck bending in the process."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You block me every chance you get with this one. So that was the first attack…","response":"DM: No, this creature is really quick and very aware of its surroundings."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So first attack is nine. There's more coming. Here comes the poison dagger, which is 23.","response":"DM: 23. That does hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is ten. Because of the Boots of Haste, I get a third attack.","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And that misses entirely. In fact, I think I threw my dagger into the bones.","response":"DM: What did you roll a one?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: A one, yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, so the first strike hits. The second one, you feel the poison energy pulse through the blade. What's the DC on that again?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's 15.\nMARISHA: We need to get off this floor real bad.\nSAM: Well you're not on it.\nMARISHA: I'm not.\nSAM: You can make a dance floor next to them.\nMARISHA: Hell no.\nSAM: She's Wolverine!\nSAM: Okay. Do I have a clean line of sight on her? Or are we too far away?","response":"DM: You guys are up in the air being held by her. Probably actually I'd say…"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm doing the eagle glide.","response":"DM: You guys are about 30 feet up right now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh man.","response":"DM: Okay, what's the range on that?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's a girl?\nASHLEY: It's a her?\nSAM: Isn't it a girl?","response":"DM: No it's a male elf."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah, well I'm so demeaning to it, I call it a girl.\nASHLEY AND LAURA: Why is that demeaning?\nSAM: Because it is a chauvinist. I know that.","response":"DM: What's the range on that, Scanlan?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm looking.\nASHLEY: Disadvantage on his roll!\nLIAM: You're in the wrong group to being saying that shit, man.\nSAM: I'm drunk!\nSAM: How far am I? I can't even tell. I can't see the board.","response":"DM: You're about 70 feet."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can't do it.","response":"DM: You can hold your turn if you want to wait for Keyleth to go."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can hold my turn? I've never done this before.","response":"DM: Yeah. Meaning if you're waiting for someone else to take their turn first, you can hold back until they do theirs. So you can wait for her to pull you closer."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. I will wait for that, then, and I love women.\nASHLEY: Oh, we know. We know.\nSAM: Biblically.\nMARISHA: Keyleth does a little dip really quick.\nMARISHA: Makes Scanlan a little nervous.\nSAM: God, Clarota.\nMARISHA: Clarota!","response":"DM: Instead Clarota is going to…"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can he heal us?","response":"DM: No. Clarota's not really the healing kind. Clarota is going to cast Blur on himself to try and keep it from taking one of these points of wound damage. So he uses his turn to cast Blur. Clarota's form begins to shift and vibrate in and out of place where it's hard to see exactly where Clarota is standing. Clarota is going to take two steps back, unfortunately in the threat range of the creature. It gets (whoosh) a reaction to attack against Clarota. Thanks to the Blur spell, though, it misses entirely. So the strike strikes and it passes through with no effect. Clarota moves behind one of the rocks here, actually this far, for cover. That ends Clarota's turn. Keyleth, you're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. I caw-caw closer","response":"DM: Like over where?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, there's good. Shit, can't cast any spells unless I land. I'm going to have to drop down. Can I perch on one of these stalactites?","response":"DM: You can, but you're going to have to let go of the gnomes to do so."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Do it.\nMARISHA: Can I drop off you guys?\nASHLEY: Yep.","response":"DM: You hear (bird noises)."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What?\nMARISHA: And I drop them off really quick.\nASHLEY: What did she say?\nASHLEY: But don't I get a plus ten?","response":"DM: Not for acrobatics, you don't."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right. You're a bullet falling from the sky.\nSAM: 16.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Eight.\nMARISHA: I'm going to turn back into Keyleth holding onto the rock.","response":"DM: Okay. So we'll put you there. Keyleth, no longer an eagle. This is out of the way. You guys both land here and here."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But I'm still on the rock. I still want to be on the rock.","response":"DM: I'm considering you on the rock, but I don't want to have to try and balance you right there. Scanlan, you land, catch yourself on the bones, and you're fine. Pike, you sink into your waist at the impact."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're gnomic lawn art.\nASHLEY: Aw, dang it!","response":"DM: Percy you're up!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, I'm not done!","response":"DM: Right. Sorry, you turn back. So Keyleth, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The laser pointer's dead. Now I'm going to make a wall of stone. Wait, is there someone in the way? Is there somebody behind him? Is that Vax?\nLIAM AND MATT: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Damn it, Vax!\nSAM: He didn't ask to be dropped there.\nLAURA: That's where we landed.\nTALIESIN: A doughnut of stone.","response":"DM: I would say, based on the description of it here…"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: A horizontal wall?","response":"DM: Ten foot by ten foot panels."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Panels. Squares.","response":"DM: Alternatively, you can create ten foot by 20 foot panels that are only three inches thick. So yes, you can, you can create any shape you desire, so you can make it a doughnut hole type thing if you want to."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Dope. So, I'm going to make a doughnut-shaped dance floor, and I'm going to make a hole in the middle to where he's still in the middle in the bone, but we're all on rock. Around this area.","response":"DM: So, it's just around all of you guys or underneath everybody?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Underneath us.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm making a dance floor.\nSAM: That was an excellent move by a strong, independent woman who doesn't need a man to tell her what to do. Or to validate her in any way.\nMARISHA: I want everybody–","response":"DM: You might not be able to get Pike."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can't get Pike?","response":"DM: No, because there would be a weird loop there."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I can maybe try to Sprinter's Boots my way up.\nMARISHA: Well, as much as I can do, but I want to make a nice hole to where he's still–","response":"DM: I would say you can either get Pike or you can get these guys here. That's about where you're going to call it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: No worries. Do some damage!","response":"DM: What are you going to do?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to boost up Pike. She's halfway underground.","response":"DM: The wall comes out and it stops there. That's as far as you can get it. This whole area now is a wall. It pops you out of the stone as the stone lifts you up. You have to catch yourself for a second, but it's not so abrupt to the point where you get knocked off the side. You're all lifted up about ten feet. So just mark that area as stone wall. Got it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Except for douchebag.","response":"DM: Except for douchebag."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Now that I'm within range, may I go?","response":"DM: After Percy, and then it's your turn. You all get to hold at the same time, so. Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Does he get an attack of opportunity if I run?","response":"DM: You don't know."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How close am I? I can't see.","response":"DM: It took one reaction against Clarota."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're further than five feet away, because had you been five feet away I could have sneak attacked.","response":"DM: Okay. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Shoot twice into the face of the asshole, Percy.\nTALIESIN: 14?","response":"DM: 14 does not hit, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: But 28 will.","response":"DM: 28 will. So the first shot, you shoot, the body just goes (sound of air splitting speed) and totally unnatural sense sees where the aim is and is already out of the way before the bullet gets there. Returns, but you catch it up with the second shot from the Pepperbox, and blast in the side of its chest. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh my god. This is awful. Six.\nTALIESIN: That's just embarrassing.\nLAURA: That's something, that's something, Percy!\nASHLEY: Hey, you know what? We're getting close!\nLAURA: That's better than a one.\nMARISHA: Pike is just an inspirational poster today. Like, it's okay, we can do it!","response":"DM: Right here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: If I could even climb up on it, that would be very cool.","response":"DM: That's going to, with your run speed, you're going to have to do that next turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine.","response":"DM: You don't have enough action to do that, but you get to it. Scanlan, you're up!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to blind him. With Blindness in his eyes.\nTALIESIN: Try blinding him with science, that usually works.","response":"DM: Are you using your hand cone?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I am using my hand cone.","response":"DM: I assume you do, for the most part. So what's your DC with that?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 19.\nORION AND ASHLEY: Yes!","response":"DM: As you release the arcane essence, you can see this darkness spill up and completely cascade over the white, almost soulless, freaking out eyes of this creature. It's very Silent Hill in the way it moves. Suddenly, its eyes (shhh noise) fill over with darkness, and you can see it beginning to writhe and move around like it's unable to truly grasp the full surroundings. It appears to have taken effect."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Nice!\nSAM: And then I give a little inspiration to Pike. I look over to her, give her a little wink, little smile…\nLIAM: Spirit her on with anger. Good job.","response":"DM: Take your 1d8 inspiration."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 1d8? Okay.\nSAM: That's all it takes.\nSAM: I think so.","response":"DM: You're going to stay right there?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Where am I?","response":"DM: You're on top of the wall, right here."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah, I'm staying on that wall, yeah. I don't want to go anywhere, yeah.","response":"DM: Okay. Pike, you're up."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. So, from where I'm at–","response":"DM: Yes, on top of this wall here."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm on top of a wall? I'm going to Guiding Bolt the whatever-it-is.\nSAM: The whatever it is.\nASHLEY: And then– okay, wait, hold on. Let me cast that at– So what do I roll for?","response":"DM: You roll and add your spell attack modifier to it, I believe it is, to hit for Guiding Bolt."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So I roll the d20 to see if I hit?","response":"DM: I'm pretty sure, yeah. It should be in the description."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.\nLAURA: That's good, that's good!\nASHLEY: 15.\nLAURA: Plus anything?\nASHLEY: Oh, plus– wait, what am I plussing? I'm so sorry!","response":"DM: Your spell attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's on your spell page.","response":"DM: It's on your spell page, top of your spell page."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: You haven't used it in a while. Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 23.","response":"DM: 23 does hit!"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yes!\nASHLEY: Okay, so then we do–","response":"DM: 4d6 points of radiant damage to it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's also blind.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 15? And I'm going to add my inspiration from him.","response":"DM: You can't add that to damage. It's only to hit."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Save it for later.\nASHLEY: So, 19.","response":"DM: 19. So, as you look down, you grab your holy symbol, and even though it is cracked, you still feel the presence of Sarenrae looking down upon you. The divine energy coalesces in your hand, and you throw it forward with a divine wrath as it streaks across the air. It slams into the side of this weird twisting abomination, and as it blasts into it you can see its tentacles reel back and pull back in severe pain and it roars this horrible, screeching (bleeegrh screech) scream into the cavern around you, echoing down the hall. It's looking a little rough."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. And then there's nothing I can do from there, right?","response":"DM: That's your action. You can move if you'd like. Move along the wall, or hop off it, or whatever you want to do."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Come closer to me!\nASHLEY: I'll stay!\nMARISHA: Because she's an independent woman.\nSAM: That's a proud choice, and I honor and respect it. I love women!","response":"DM: So currently, because it's–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Pike's not the only one cashing karma points.","response":"DM: So technically, I should have remembered this, but you hit anyway: while it's blinded, attacks against it have advantage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, okay.\nORION: No. 17.","response":"DM: 17? Nice! Let's see…"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: On the ground, you look up like…\nORION: No! My big toe! Bah!","response":"DM: Third strike is going to whip around and attempt to grab… roll between both… Okay, it's going to go for Lady Kima. And that's a natural 20."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.\nTALIESIN: She's a magnet.\nMARISHA: Even with disadvantage?","response":"DM: Well, actually, no, technically it would've still been a 15, so it's not a critical, but it still hits."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's good.","response":"DM: Unfortunately, without her full armor, her AC is not that crazy. So it's not a critical. That's nice. That brings it to a total of 18 points of damage with an additional six acid damage to Lady Kima."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh. Acid. None of us have gotten hit yet.","response":"DM: And the tentacle (whoosh) wraps around her and grapples her in place, and she's currently held in place by its tentacle. She stays where she is. It is now going to attempt to leap away. It brings all of its tentacles to the ground and (whoosh) leaps up into the air."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Attacking before it goes.","response":"DM: You get one attack of opportunity against it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 27.","response":"DM: 27 does hit."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I swing at it with my cane as I'm on the floor.","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I get an attack?\nLIAM: 11.\nMARISHA: Son of a bitch!","response":"DM: Vex, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And I'm going to attack it twice.\nLAURA: Ooh! That was a 30!","response":"DM: You have advantage on these strikes, by the way. Well, actually, let me see, because I think it gets a save each turn to try to get rid of your blindness, which it does not make."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Nice. Is he blind?","response":"DM: Okay. So still blinded."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 29.","response":"DM: Hits. Definitely."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And 23.","response":"DM: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage on both attacks. First one with the extra d10 for Blazing Bowstring. This arrow: once again, you pull out, burst into flame (whoosh). The heat is a bit strong for your face, but you release it forward; it actually impacts into your damage. Streaks across with an arc of fire, and slamming into its side, dealing?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 14 points of damage on the first one.\nASHLEY: And can I cast War God's Blessing on her and give her a plus ten? For an attack roll?","response":"DM: She's already attacked, but to other people, you can. And you can do it after they roll. If somebody rolls and you're like, that's a really bad roll, you can be like, plus ten! and it might give them enough to push them over the edge. It's not for damage."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: It's not for damage. It's for–","response":"DM: Attacking, to make sure you hit them."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I understand. Okay, great.\nLAURA: But with Hunter's Mark– she's still Hunter's Marked!","response":"DM: Correct. Oh, did you not roll that damage?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Four.\nORION: Yes.","response":"DM: So, do you get up? You're currently lying on the top of the wall."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I look around, and I don't like what I see, and I try to get up.","response":"DM: Okay. You (grunts) stand back up. You're currently at the top of the wall; it's ten feet up."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Really? Okay, where's he again? All I see is mountains. Oh, I see, you put the yellow ring around him? And Kima's to the right of him?\nLAURA: Kima's being held by him.\nORION: Oh, okay. Great. I look at him, see what's going on. I (ping) my Ioun Stone, and I conjure out Telekinesis from it, and I guide it towards the monster's tentacle to unwrap it off Kima, and I attempt to pull it off her.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an arcana check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's Telekinesis, Kyle!\nORION: Sweet! 20.\nORION: Can I also go like, (bash) Stop hitting yourself!","response":"DM: The tentacle starts slapping around its body, and it looks confused. It's not enough to do any damage, but it looks unsure as to why it's having a hard time controlling its own limbs."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I give a nod to Kima.\nORION: That's my turn.\nLIAM: I'm still hasted, so I'm going to use a bonus action to go stealth.\nLIAM: What?","response":"DM: It's blinded."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, it's blinded? But do I still need that to sneak attack, though? Or does it matter? Never mind. I'm running at it, and since Kima's right there, I'm going to stab the bejesus out of it.","response":"DM: Go for it!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to use Luck on that roll.","response":"DM: Okay. Well, you have advantage, remember, because it's blinded."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, great. So that is a 29.","response":"DM: 29 hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.\n(incoherent mumbling)\nLIAM: Which part gets doubled? I always forget.","response":"DM: It's the dice."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So 19 goes to 38, and then the damage gets added to that, right?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: With the sneak attack, and the damage gets doubled–","response":"DM: Correct, and then the bonus at the end gets added on to that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, and then with that knife in, I'm going to stick the other knife in and attempt to attack it and then drag it to the ground. Grapple it to the ground with my body as I attack. Second attack is a 25.","response":"DM: 25 hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. That's seven.","response":"DM: Are you doing damage, or you grappling him?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll grapple.","response":"DM: Okay, so there's no damage on this. Go ahead and make an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. 20. Natural 20.","response":"DM: Nice! So you grab it, and you pull it. You have it currently held. Its physical body is pulled to the ground, and you can see its arms are trying to pull it up off the ground, and (slurpy noises) flipping around. Complete chaos in the air. You imagine you'll probably have a hard time holding it down, but for now it's currently blinded and grappled."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: With haste, I have a third attack.","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to drag across its throat. That is a 25.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And that's seven.\nALL: (noises of disgust)\nSAM: It has a maw?","response":"DM: Kima's turn. Kima sees you holding it down. Takes the sword, swings it, and is going to come on down, spending a level-three spell as a Divine Smite against it. That hits with a 22. This advantage is kicking its ass. Second attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice Blind, Scanlan.\nORION: Kima?\nMATT AND LAURA: Kima.\nLAURA: Oh, I wonder if that's going to happen to all of us.","response":"DM: She's unable to break from that. She's now being pulled down into the ground beneath her. That brings us to Clarota's turn. Clarota is going to move–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Who all is on the dance floor?","response":"DM: Ugh, can't do this."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: All of us except for Percy, I think.","response":"DM: Clarota's going to stand here and pull back and begin to coalesce this bluish crackling energy in Clarota's hand. The tentacles of Clarota's face begin to swirl and pull back into this horrible grimace as it releases this bolt of lighting energy that arcs past, just overhead of where Kima is, since Kima's been pulled down below. Lightning Bolt. Two ones in a row, are you fucking kidding me? I'm rolling terribly tonight, guys, by the way."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's mostly in our favor.\nLAURA: It's better than one, Clarota! It's better than one!\nMARISHA: What?","response":"DM: No, continue."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. And I make a Grasping Vine from that stalactite over there.","response":"DM: Here?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes. And I'm going to take it and wrap it around Lady Kima and try to yank her out.\nMARISHA: Around her waist. Not her neck, again.","response":"DM: Right."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Just wanting that out there.","response":"DM: Yeah. It's a good thing. So, Grasping Vine… yeah, okay. So it pulls 20 feet; she gets pulled 20 feet. I'll go ahead and say, make a wisdom check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm trying not to hurt her.","response":"DM: Right, I understand. This is more your strength of will versus the strength of whatever–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just adding my wisdom?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 20. Total.","response":"DM: 20. So, as the vine wraps around her and begins to pull, she reaches over and grabs the vine for extra strength, and (fwoomp) it pulls her out of the wall. She goes flying over and lands at the side of the stone with a vine that's still loosely wrapped around her, but it's definitely pulled her free of the floor."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I leave it to where it's holding her up, to where it's not touching?","response":"DM: Sure! Yeah. She's currently held aloft by this vine that strapped her. She's looking confused. Thankful, but also wants to be let go."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I take a bonus action to shout at her? Be like, “Calm down Kima! Jeez!”","response":"DM: Sure. Is that the end of your turn?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes!","response":"DM: Okay! As you finish casting the spell and shouting at her, you look down and notice the ground. (swish, shoosh) Begins pulling you down"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, I'm still on the stalactites. I haven't moved off the stalactite! I'm straddling it.\nASHLEY: A little straddle action!\nMARISHA: I'm riding that stalactite","response":"DM: Go ahead."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Riding it side-saddle.","response":"DM: It's really hard to be on top of that and cast spells and talk about this. (chuckling) It's a giant piece. I'm going to say, go ahead and make an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Jeez, Kima! Stop! This is hard already!","response":"DM: Percy!"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl and find myself a seat on top of that stalactite. That's my first thing I'm going to do.","response":"DM: Okay, well, at the start of your turn, make a dexterity check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 20!\nTALIESIN: Athletics or acrobatics?","response":"DM: This would be athletics, just to pull yourself up on the side."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Rock climbing check.\nTALIESIN: 13.","response":"DM: 13. Okay! You can decide whether or not you want to attempt to ascend this or make any attacks this turn, because right now it's going to take your full round to get to the top of this. It's a very thin, jagged, almost vertical wall you're trying to climb up and hold onto."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How far away am I from the stones? From the platform?","response":"DM: From the platform here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: From something I can stand on that's not sand.","response":"DM: You're probably about 35 feet."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So I could make it in a run?","response":"DM: You could make it in a run, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What's your movement?\nTALIESIN: My movement is 30. Just almost make it?","response":"DM: Yeah. Right now, this wall's blocking you from even seeing the creature. As far as you know, you see a giant wall and you hear fighting on the other side of it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll make it to the top of the stalactite, then.","response":"DM: Okay, so. (grunts) You get up to the top. I'll put this here as a reminder. But that's where you are right now. Okay, that ends your turn. Scanlan!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is there anywhere I can stay on the dance floor and get a line of sight with the creature?","response":"DM: I'll say you'll be able to get right up next to Tiberius, right here, and be able to get line of sight."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And can I throw lightning and not hit Tiberius?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's a he! God!\nSAM: I have no ranged attacks. Except I can Viciously Mock it, so that's what I'll do. I'll say, you know what? Your tentacles make you look kind of fat, and the elf thing is played out. It's sort of 1990s. Orlando Bloom. And the whole bone thing is just really tacky!","response":"DM: Tiberius looks over. You look over your shoulder at Scanlan with a curious look. Rolled a four. So essentially, being blind, all it can rely on right now is audio sensation around it. And it picks up ringing through the air. What hint and shred of humanity is within its psyche understands the Common you speak in its direction. And for a moment, it seems to sag all its tentacles. Go ahead and roll damage for your Vicious Mockery."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Three! Yes! It's the only ranged attack I have.","response":"DM: I was just seeing if there's another effect of Vicious Mockery."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: He's dead!\nMARISHA: Yeah, he just dies!\nORION: Negative two to self-esteem.","response":"DM: Vicious Mockery– has disadvantage on– okay! So it has disadvantage on disadvantage on its next attack. Got it!"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Does that mean it has triple?","response":"DM: Nah. If it did, that would be awesome. Pike, you're up!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh! And as my bonus action, I'm going to inspire somebody. I don't know. Who? I look over at Liam and I do– sorry, Vax. And I do one of these.\nLIAM: I giggle-snort.","response":"DM: Okay. That brings us to Pike. You're up."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so where are we at? I'm so sorry. I can't see.","response":"DM: You're right there, on top of the wall, on the far back end. You can't even see the entity. It's way off to the side and a bunch of people are in a row on top of a wall that Keyleth created."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to use my Sprinter's Boots and get over. Everybody's healed; everybody hasn't really taken too many hit points?","response":"DM: You've guys rolled really well and it has rolled terribly."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So I'm going to go around here. Oh, I don't know, can I have–","response":"DM: It's a very thin wall. Make an acrobatics check to try and move and tumble through the people. With disadvantage because you're in heavy plate armor."}
{"prompt":"SAM: But you've got inspiration.","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You can add that to your roll. So add inspiration.","response":"DM: Roll twice. You're at disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 13.\nASHLEY: What, plus eight?\nSAM: You can roll a d8.\nLIAM: It's advantage, so pick the higher.","response":"DM: No, disadvantage, because she's in heavy armor."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh oh oh.\nASHLEY: 16.","response":"DM: 16? You just manage to barely squeeze through people without falling off of the top of the wall, finding yourself right there."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. So then, since I'm there, I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt again.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: And then I'm going to cast it at 4th level again. And then, which is–","response":"DM: Roll to attack twice. You have to roll to hit it first. Roll twice, because it is blinded and has disadvantage. You have advantage on it, I mean."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 18.\nLAURA: Plus your spell thing?","response":"DM: 18 plus your spell."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh, which would be 26.","response":"DM: That does hits. Go ahead and roll damage. You are at 4th level, that is 7d6 damage."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Nice! Holy crap.\nSAM: Pike, perhaps you should spare it for your god, or offer it in sacrifice to your god?\nASHLEY: Sorry, guys.\nTALIESIN: That's a lot of math.\nSAM: You know what? Women are good at math.\nORION: They are.\nTALIESIN: They are.\nSAM: Probably better than men.\nORION: I would say probably.\nASHLEY: And then do I add anything?","response":"DM: No, that's just the 7d6."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 26.","response":"DM: 26 damage, nice!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Good adding.\nASHLEY: Hey, thanks!","response":"DM: As you pull through the rest of the crowd, you stand next to someone, you grab your holy symbol again. This time, looking up to your hand. This divine energy materializes and shines down in a god ray onto your hand as you gather it with your fingers, it seems to formulate this actual thick rock feeling sensation. You swing it underhand softball pitch with absolute furious anger that slams into the side of the creature, bursting with the divine energy, doing a very sincerely impressive amount of damage for a small Guiding Bolt. It's currently still trying to get back up after Vax has been holding it to the ground. You can see it blast its side. You are almost pulled over on top of it by the sheer force of the impact."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Sorry, Vax!","response":"DM: That brings us to the top of it now."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's still alive?\nASHLEY: It's still alive?!\nLIAM: It's got that healing factor.\nSAM: Can we undo its healing factor?","response":"DM: After all the impact, all the sounds it's hearing, it moves over to this vicinity."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ain't he grappled?","response":"DM: Oh, you're holding it here."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm holding it.","response":"DM: It's going to attempt to break from your grapple."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Good luck.","response":"DM: So you make an acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do I get advantage on this?","response":"DM: For this check, you do, I believe."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, good. 27.","response":"DM: 27? 29. It slips out of your grasp, moves over to this vicinity here. And you can see now, the tendrils open up, even though its eyes can't see. You can see what looks like a bunch of gills across its body, slits in its torso and it almost looks like all of them open up into these tiny little mouths. You can also see teeth rippling through them and expels this cloud of green gas that (fssh) around everyone within ten feet of it. Everyone on the wall, right here. Clarota– you are just out of range of it– and Kima are affected. So that would be Pike, Vex, Trinket, technically. Clarota. So I need you guys to make a constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What?\nSAM: (garbled) Make a constitution saving throw.","response":"DM: Pike? Whenever she comes back."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Who has to do this? Pike, Clarota?","response":"DM: Pike, Clarota, Trinket, Vex."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should I roll for Pike?","response":"DM: Wait until she gets back. What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 19. Oh, 19 and then for Trinket– oh no.","response":"DM: Clarota does not make it. Kima does not make it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can roll for Pike.\nLAURA: No!\nSAM: I've got this, guys. We're connected in a special gnome way that you have no idea how pure this bond is.\nLIAM: Here comes the one.\nSAM: 16, plus whatever.\nLAURA: Oh, plus her– wait, I'm looking up her constitution. Plus one. 17.\nLAURA: Seven.\nLAURA: But I rolled a 19.","response":"DM: Right, as this cloud of greenish gas bursts out from all these strange slits in its body, you feel this acidic fume fill your lungs and touch your skin. You manage to duck out of the way and resist a lot of the damage, as does Pike, pulling up her cloak in front of the way. You guys take 14 points of acid damage. However, Clarota and Kima and Trinket all take 28 points of acid damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) 28 points?!","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: For Trinket?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is Trinket still a cat?","response":"DM: Trinket's kitten form is taken away as the Polymorph wears off–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, shit. Boom!","response":"DM: (boosh) This bear bursts out from your chest."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, no, your shirt is ripped.\nLAURA: All of a sudden, my bosom comes flying out.","response":"DM: So Trinket's at full health again. Hold on, the kitten form, I'm going to say, would have about five hit points, so taking five from 28… Trinket has taken 23 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Pike, you just took 14.","response":"DM: 14 points of acid poison damage, as this entity vented its torso into this giant fume of acidic gas."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It would have been much more if Scanlan hadn't been around, that's all I'm saying.\nASHLEY: Oh, wow. Okay.","response":"DM: At which Trinket bursts out of Vex's torso, landing into the bones below. (growls)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, in the bones?","response":"DM: Yeah, because on the wall (fwoosh) out in front of you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Now we know how many hit points it takes to kill a kitten. That will actually be useful. Five. Five hit points.\nLAURA: Five hit points. That's good.\nTALIESIN: Five hit points, everyone.\nLAURA: That's me!","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is there anything– what's nearby? Is anything within five feet of it?","response":"DM: Oh, actually, I should see if it– it does resist. It is no longer blinded."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, snap.","response":"DM: You can see the darkness fades from its eyes and the whiteness bursts from its face. It's intent now, as each eye individually darts around and takes reference of all the points of possible attack that are now before it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, its blindness wore off? Oh, poop.\nLAURA: Is anything within five feet of it?","response":"DM: Trinket is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket's going to be affected. Oh! I command Trinket to move, then. Can he?","response":"DM: Okay. Trinket can, yeah, if you want."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can he try to climb up and get away from it? Oh, no. He'll take a hit, won't he.","response":"DM: He will."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do it.\nLIAM: If it hits. It could miss.\nLAURA: Oh god, but he's so low on health.\nASHLEY: Where's he at?\nLAURA: He's right next to it! Get up, Trinket, get up on the wall. And I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns on the thing.","response":"DM: What's the radius on Hail of Thorns?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Five feet.\nTALIESIN: Bears can climb trees.","response":"DM: Trees, yes. Solid, smooth stone walls? Little more of… but–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What is it, is it an acrobatics?","response":"DM: It's going to be athletics for Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Athletics. I don't know what to add, but it's 19 plus whatever. Strength?","response":"DM: 19 plus strength."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 23.","response":"DM: Okay, Trinket scrambles up the side of the wall. As it does, one of the white eyes is looking around like an iguana (tchh) focuses on Trinket, (whoosh) goes to whip toward Trinket. That is going to be a 24 versus his armor class."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, it hits!","response":"DM: Trinket takes 17 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: Plus an additional five points of acid damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket's unconscious!","response":"DM: As Trinket climbs up the wall, (shh, groan) and then streaks and falls back down onto the bone, unconscious."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Bear down!\nASHLEY: We'll heal him!\nLAURA: Oh, no! He's lying in the skeletons.","response":"DM: So you're now there up top. What are you going to do? You watched Trinket fall and hit the ground."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Kill him!\nSAM: Not Trinket.\nLAURA: Do I get to– can I move if I attack, or is that it?","response":"DM: You gave Trinket your move on this turn, so you can still attack from where you are."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Attack him!\nLAURA: Will somebody save Trinket?\nMARISHA: I'll save Trinket.\nLAURA: Okay, then I still attack him. But wait, will I do damage to Trinket, then, still on the ground, unconscious?","response":"DM: What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, I was going to do Hail of Thorns, but I shouldn't because he's within five feet?","response":"DM: Within five feet."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You could do a regular arrow.","response":"DM: You've used your flaming arrow twice."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, I only used it once.","response":"DM: No, you used it at the top of the round, too."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shitballs. Okay, then I'm– I have regular arrows. I'm going to use Bloodseeking Bow, then.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god. I'm freaking out.","response":"DM: Make your bloodseeking strike, now, with the fury and anger and frustration–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 26.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nASHLEY: Roll for damage.\nLAURA: 11, plus Hunter's Mark. 15. And then the Bloodseeking Bow does ten bleeding damage each round.","response":"DM: Nice. Okay, when we get back to its turn, it'll have ten bleeding damage on it. You have your second attack, too."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. 24.","response":"DM: 24 hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's 12. 13.","response":"DM: Okay. So both arrows (zoomf zoomf) sink down. You can see your jaw's tense and you can feel the tear running down your face, but you are intent on taking this son of a bitch down. That brings us to Tiberius. Actually, at the end of your turn, go ahead and make a death saving throw. For Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god.\nSAM: Death saving throw?!\nLIAM: Three successes or three fails. That's first fail.\nASHLEY: Wait, what? No. I can add a plus ten, right?","response":"DM: To a death saving throw?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Not so much.","response":"DM: It has to be attacks for you, unfortunately. So that's one death saving throw on Trinket. Tiberius, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: This is a grizzly situation!\nORION: Okay. I assess the situation, and I don't like it.\nSAM: The end.\nORION: No. I cast Watery Sphere on him, and try to capture the guy in my sphere. That is– oh, plus this! (gasps) Oh my god, I always forget it's that number. It's 27.\nORION: 18 plus nine?","response":"DM: I'm just trying to get familiar with this one real fast, guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So he uses his spell attack bonus, I'm assuming?","response":"DM: Watery Sphere, you said?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah. I was looking that up, too.","response":"DM: Watery Sphere. Got it here. Okay. Over the edge, and ten feet– okay, it's not an attack roll for you. It has to make a strength saving throw. Saving throw. That is a 21. What's the DC for your spell?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17.","response":"DM: Okay. So yeah. The sphere appears. The creature is ejected from the side right there. So the sphere is still there, but the creature is un-grabbed by it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Does it do damage?","response":"DM: As far as I know, it just grabs."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, fine. I can still move it, yes?\nLAURA: Can you pick Trinket up and bring him up on the wall?\nORION: She's got this. I'll move it over just to make him all soak-y in it anyway. It's not going to– I can't move him. It doesn't control him, right?","response":"DM: No, not if he makes the save. If he fails the save, then yes, you have them trapped in the sphere, but currently basically (sploosh) pushed his way out of it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, fine. I don't do that. I spend– I don't do anything, actually. That's my turn.","response":"DM: Okay. Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so Clarota's right by it, so I'm going to roll along the back of the thing and sneak attack right into its back.","response":"DM: Right here?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right there. Yeah, roll around next to him, one dagger in. That is a 29.","response":"DM: 29. Yeah, that hits. Damn."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (counts quietly) Okay, that is 33, plus sneak attack damage, so three, seven. Shit. 18, 20. That's 40 plus four. 44.","response":"DM: Rogues, man."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 51. I want to carve his shoulder blade out and away like a piece of turkey–","response":"DM: It's not a critical."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No. Critical's the double. Oh, sorry, scale that back to–\nLIAM: 20. It was 20 plus two, 22. 29.","response":"DM: 29 points of damage. Still nice. So as you reach back and you angrily take the dagger and drag it down, you actually find one of those seams of its arm, and you drag it across the front as the arm actually (floop) falls off on the ground and it squirms on its own."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What's taking this thing so long?","response":"DM: You've managed to pull one of its tentacles off."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Next dagger's out. That was a bad roll, but I'm going to use one of my Lucks to do that again. That hits. That's 27.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So that is seven points of damage.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Last dagger out. That's 26, for eight points of damage.","response":"DM: Nice. Eight points of damage, got it. Great!"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: How is this thing not dead?!","response":"DM: Kima is going to rush around here."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Don't be stupid, Kima!\nSAM: What is it with you and Kima?\nLAURA: What are you talking about? She's a paladin!\nSAM: She's fighting with us! Don't dispirit her while we're fighting!\nLIAM: This is really awkward for the rest of us, just so you know. We really like her.","response":"DM: Kima's going to attack twice with her greatsword."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't like her.\nSAM: I don't like her either, but I'm not openly hostile to her.","response":"DM: Kima goes to strike twice, but with each blade strike, the head glimpses over, sees the attack and the body bends out of the way of the first strike. The second one, a tentacle actually slaps the blade out of her hand and she has to reach over and pick it up again off the side of the ground. The blind was very effective these past couple of rounds, but now it's back to its full strength and can see, and you can see now that it can see where everyone is, it's going to be much harder to hit. Unless you're this guy and this girl. That brings us to Clarota. Clarota can't use what Clarota wants to do, unfortunately. Instead, is going to–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What does Clarota want to do?\nTALIESIN: Dance.\nASHLEY AND LAURA: Dance!","response":"DM: You've had it used on you before. It's called a Mind Blast that the mind flayers did before in a cone attack that can stun things in front of it. But everyone's been clustered around it, so Clarota can't quite get a place that doesn't affect somebody else. So instead he's going to do a tentacle attack against it. That is– oh, wow! That's a 26. That hits! Takes 15 points of damage and is grappled by Clarota. Clarota currently has his tentacles wrapped up onto it and is trying to pull it down with a combination of psionic energy and its tentacle grab. Keyleth, you're up!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Around his waist!\nMARISHA: Okay. Around his waist.\nMARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay. So the Grasping Vine– from this one here?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Nope, that one.","response":"DM: Okay. The wall is here, so it's going to have to curl around the side, wrap around the body. As it begins to pull, you can see the bones have already begun to reach up and begun to start pulling Trinket's body down. Go ahead and make the check for that again which is…"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What is it?\nTALIESIN: Will.\nMARISHA: Oh, will?","response":"DM: For this one I think it was to try and– wait a sec, I'm just making sure. I think it was wisdom for the– Let me check it real fast, just to make sure. This is starting to get down to the heavy. “Creature must make dexterity saving throw to resist pull.” Yeah, so go ahead and make a willpower check. Wisdom check, sorry."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 20 again.","response":"DM: The vine wraps around Trinket and begins to pull. The bones hold tight and the body is not moving from its position."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No!\nASHLEY: Wait, so we don't know?","response":"DM: It's at a standoff right now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's a standoff. It's tug-of-war.","response":"DM: Yeah. Not sinking, but not being pulled out, either. It's this stalemate right now between the two. The vine is taut and holding Trinket level."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to spend my movement to get nice and firm, sit myself down, pull out the big gun.","response":"DM: Okay. Bad News. You see it over this wall now. The top of this stalagmite– it's about 50 feet to the top. You get to the top, you pull the Bad News out. You have a pretty clear shot down towards the entity."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Taking a sharpshooter shot. Natural 20 on the first shot.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll damage for this one."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This is going to be so much fun. (counts out loud) 42 points of damage.","response":"DM: How do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I take a bead and I want to wait until the eye is looking right at me, and I want to take it right through the eye.","response":"DM: Okay. So as the entity turns around, its head cocked to the side, its tendrils (sucking noise) flailing around it, one lifting it up. You can see, it begins to reach up to bring a lash down upon the bear that is being clasped on the ground, its eye streaks around and catches yours. You release, pull back on the trigger… (gunshot) The impact blows you off the top of the stalagmite. You fall in the air, but in that split second, you keep your vision on as you're floating back and this whole– this moment as time slows, not wanting to lose this moment, you see the bullet (ssst) into the head. One of the eyes now goes dark from the crimson impact. The jaw opens slack (groaning), with all the teeth exposing as the back of the head (explosion)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I love it!","response":"DM: The giant hole now, which is like you can see portions of its lower jaw are still visible, but the entire top of its head is gone. You can see parts of its flesh trying to reach up and re-form, and then starting falling limp as its form begins to quiver and eventually fall apart. The seams all begin to unravel and its entire body begins to fall apart into chunks. Eventually what's left is this elven torso that slinks to its knees (boof), takes a step,takes another step, and then falls onto its back, completely destroyed. The bones begin to reach up and take its body. Trinket is still currently being held aloft."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I see what's going on. I cast Telekinesis (fssh) and start pulling it up.","response":"DM: Okay, make an arcana check. You have advantage on this because the Grasping Vine is also helping."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh my god. Arcana? 12.","response":"DM: 12? You (strains) you're pulling, you're pulling, you're pulling, but unfortunately whatever cursed force holds this land is keeping the body–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, I run up and take the Mace of Disruption, which also has the holy oil on it, which fights against undead! So I take it and I go (ffff) right underneath.\nMARISHA: Grab onto the vine!\nLIAM: It's scared of her.\nASHLEY: It's scared of me. Yeah, that's right!\nLAURA: Get Trinket out, and I'll pull Pike up.\nMARISHA: Okay, I pull the bear out.","response":"DM: Between the two of you guys, you manage to, now that it's been released from the bone, as Tiberius (strains) lifts up and the vine grasping, you lift Trinket up onto the wall, and Tiberius you (thud) release Trinket on the top of the wall."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm healing! Giving a healing potion.\nMARISHA: Can I take my Grasping Vine and I want to reach out and grab the elven man real quick.","response":"DM: You reach out the Grasping Vine and you lift up the remnants of the elven man."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I want to throw his remnants back onto our dance floor.\nLAURA: The minimum, because someone else can heal him, right?\nASHLEY: Yeah.","response":"DM: Yeah, yeah. That'll be 2d4 plus two."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Seven. He's only got seven little health points!\nLAURA: Trinket!","response":"DM: As soon as it opens up and the first thing Trinket sees is your face, Trinket begins to lick the side of your face."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! (sobs) Buddy! I'm crying and I'm petting him and I say, “It's okay.”","response":"DM: Kima, Clarota, and Vax. You guys are still on the ground. You can feel the stones and bones beginning to pull up against your feet. Clarota immediately begins to lift off the ground using his Levitation ability, and pulls free of the bones, lifts there for a second. Yes?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I keep propellering my Mace of Disruption as I walk? On the ground?","response":"DM: You can. As you're walking along, you're just (kssh) hitting bits of bone. As you are, they just disintegrate and turn into dust. It's leaving a track. A little bit of a groove in the ground as you do so."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Follow me! Follow the track!\nMARISHA: I'm going to loot this corpse real quick. See if I see anything with this.","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: With this corpse. Does anyone want to help me? Who's got better investigation?\nTALIESIN AND SAM: Sure.\nLAURA: I've got it, but I'm busy with Trinket.\nMARISHA: Ugh, yeah.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, never mind.\nSAM: I've got it. 24.\nMARISHA: Scanlan!","response":"DM: You start looking at it, and the clothes that are on it are soiled and destroyed and are just ruined by whatever process it went through. as you inspect the shoulders where the tentacles are, you start seeing these strange little fleshy nubs, and as you pull away at where the wounds were taken from pulling off, you can see there are arms inside the torso that were pushed inside to attach this entity."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can we–","response":"DM: Can you what?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Go ahead. Sorry.","response":"DM: You can see a couple of fingers poking out of each side."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Should we take the body?\nSAM: Do we see any ligatures? Is there sewing? Or has it been stitched together?","response":"DM: The tentacles were stitched to it, and you can't see any actual stitches, like it's this weird thing where it's actually bonded to it, but it looks like some sort of strange–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'll do an arcana check on that, and I already got 22.","response":"DM: Okay. There is a magical essence from somewhere in the torso, but you can't quite ascertain–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: From somewhere in the torso?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do we recognize this elf at all?\nSAM: I'll take out my dagger and dig into his torso.","response":"DM: As you (squishy flesh sounds) begin to pull out bits, the rest of you guys manage to make your way up to the top of this stone wall now. You're all for the most part safe, for the time being."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Thank you for that.","response":"DM: Sorry. You cut through the body. You start seeing there are just layers and layers of teeth growing out of all portions in the interior of it. You find the fingers are attached to a hand, which are attached to a wrist. You pull a little bit, and with this horrible sickening (fssht) sound you manage to pull an arm out from inside the torso, covered in its own blood and fluids."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Prestidigitation! Clean that up.","response":"DM: You clean it off. The magical essence you were seeing earlier actually is coming from a set of metallic bracers that are on the wrists."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Take them! I take them.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't put them on, though. Don't put them on.\nORION: I'll inspect them.\nLIAM: They're cursed.","response":"DM: Okay. Make an arcana check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Let's see. 13.","response":"DM: 13? It takes you a while, but you manage to get an idea of what the essence of the magic is."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I think it's for you, Vex.\nLAURA: Oh, really? Let me see it.\nORION: Translated, it's Bracers of Archery. You should check it out.\nASHLEY: Can I cast Cure Wounds on Trinket? And I cast him to 20. Second level. I rolled.","response":"DM: You rolled a 20 total?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah. 20 total.","response":"DM: Okay. So Trinket heals 20 more hit points."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, yay! Really?\nMARISHA: Let's get out of here.\nSAM: Hey, will you lead the way, Pike, with your crazy mace path?\nLIAM: Air guitar us out of here?\nASHLEY: Can I keep on? (guitar noises)\nORION: Actually, wait a minute. Hold on a sec. My water sphere is still there, isn't it? I'm going to take it and push it along our way as well, in front of her who's swinging it as well.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Push it up to 30 feet.","response":"DM: So you're pushing this behind her?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: In front of her. Just a nice little (pssht) like 30 feet from where we are.","response":"DM: Okay. So the sphere crests ahead as you guys push forward. Pike, you're taking your mace of disruption with your shield up and you're slamming it before you. As it does there's just plumes of dust that are being cast in the air behind you guys. You cough a little bit as it's lifting the small spray of dust. You begin to make your way across this open field of bone and glass to the other side, finding for the first time in a little bit of time solid stone ground. You all take a moment and gather your breath, and as you're taking a moment, you look over and you can see in the darkness ahead of you what looks to be a faint source of light around another large pillar or cluster of stone in the distance."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Is it a color?\nLAURA: Do I see any tracks around?","response":"DM: It's reddish-orange and appears to have a flicker to it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do I see tracks? Can I sense goliath tracks?","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll a survival check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: How far away is it from us?","response":"DM: It's probably about 70, 80 feet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 25.","response":"DM: 25? You see more duergar feet patterns, and you see those same singular tracks."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And you said it's flickering, the light?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Probably a campfire.\nSAM: Let's go kick some ass.\nMARISHA: Want to go see?\nLIAM: I'll go take a look.","response":"DM: Roll stealth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Take a short rest there.\nSAM: Do we need it? Is anyone hurt?\nMARISHA: Just a short one.\nLIAM: 25.","response":"DM: 25?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Everyone rest while I go peek, because I'm fine.\nSAM: We don't need rest for spells, we just need rest for health, right?\nMARISHA: Just a short rest, yeah, so I can recharge my animal changes.\nASHLEY: If we take a short rest, do we get any spells back?","response":"DM: No spells back, unfortunately. You guys stay back while you go ahead and stealth your way up. Did you roll disadvantage on that one?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Disadvantage?\nSAM: Your foot.\nLAURA: Because of your foot!\nLIAM: But the cloak then cancels it out.","response":"DM: That's right, yes, so you're fine. It's a natural roll."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So 25.","response":"DM: 25, okay. So you make your way through the darkness, around the side of the stone platform and as you crest your vision, you can see the flickering is indeed a small campfire. Not used for light, but apparently used for cooking as the scent also hits you. There is some sort of meat currently being cooked on this flame."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Does it smell good?","response":"DM: It smells pretty good. You're not quite sure what the source of the meat is. You worry for a second because you see the two duergar that are sitting there, currently holding the meat in the center of this, are staying next to a giant troll who has his hand on the side of a rickety wooden cart. On this cart, which you can see, there are two sets of wheels on each side, there is a large lumbering goliath individual currently held down with bands of iron. Your mind for second thinks, “Oh god, are they eating him?” but you see he appears to be intact, though with a quick glance as you peer around the other side of the stone column, you can see his body is riddled with scratches and small wounds and incisions, and you can see where streaks of dried blood are across his entire body."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They're going to try to make him into one of the stitch monsters!\nMARISHA: Yes, they are.\nLAURA: We're not there.","response":"DM: You also do see, across the way there are three tents set up around this area. One of the tents opens up and you see a duergar female step out: silver circlet across her forehead, long robes. Queen Ulara walks up and starts talking to the other duergar, pointing to your goliath friend, to Grog, on the front of this. Motions to the other two and steps back into the tent, closing it behind her as the two other duergar grin. One reaches into his pouch and begins to pull out small, looks like metal hooked utensils, possibly to go in for another round of whatever they'd been doing."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm going to kill that bitch!\nLIAM: Into my earring, (whispers) Come, now.\nORION: Ooh! Vax just said we should go!\nLAURA: (whispers) We should go!","response":"DM: And this is where we're going to end today's session."}
{"prompt":"(all groan)\nSAM: Wow. That was exciting, and I feel empowering to a lot of the female–\nORION: Female viewers, absolutely.\nSAM: Pike did a lot of important things.\nORION: Absolutely, I would agree.","response":"DM: So. As a quick overview as to where we were, the party essentially was given a quest from the capital city of Emon to find the missing folk hero Lady Kima of Vord, a halfling paladin, very well known, who had gone missing while on a pilgrimage vision quest over the past year. She had been missing for a number of weeks, nearly months at this point, and you were sent to the dwarven city of Kraghammer to find and bring her back safely. After going to the city, you discover that she had delved into the mines, seeking some sort of extremely dark evil that was seated somewhere deep beneath Kraghammer proper. In searching for her, you managed to find your way through the mines into the entrance passage into the Underdark. The Underdark which is a very scary place. You've encountered a number of subterranean beasts and creatures, some of which are unnaturally mutated or altered by some sort of magic you cannot place."}
{"prompt":"Upon going through these caverns, a few battles with duergar, the ashen-skinned evil subterranean dwarves– further subterranean dwarves, I guess you'd say, and encountered your first mind flayers, illithids, which seem to have allied, strangely, with the duergar. Normally enemies by nature, they're working together under what you discovered in sense is a common enemy referred to as K'Varn. Nothing really is known of K'Varn, other than it has a great power and has united these two forces for some nefarious purpose. Apparently these abominations, and these strange mutations you've encountered, these experiments, also seem to have been created by K'Varn, though no one knows quite why or how.\nAs you traversed down, you managed to… befriend an arcanist mind flayer that was cast out from the colony, named Clarota, who has aided you under the intent that you would help him free his people of the slavery of K'Varn and release the mind flayers to their own normal state of mind. And you've made your way to the  Duergar fortress, Emberhold, found and released Lady Kima, who underwent many, many weeks of torturous experiences to come through still firm of mind and ready to kick some ass. Through a very painful battle in the Emberhold, you managed to pull your party out, only a few of them turned to stone, and with a foot burned off.","response":"DM: And Grog being dominated and Grog-napped by the surviving queen, duergar Queen Ulara."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What? Everybody needs a nap.\nMARISHA: We're going to have to get one of those child leashes for you.\nLAURA: Maybe we can get a chip implanted in him so we can track him all the time.\nMARISHA: Oh yeah, like a dog chip?\nTRAVIS: I like chips.\nLAURA: Yeah. Or like one of those tiles you put on your keys.\nMARISHA: Yes. That's actually not a bad idea. Can we do that?\nTALIESIN: There's an app for that.\nSAM: A Grog-jack?\nTRAVIS: Percy, you can make that.","response":"DM: Grog-jack? Whenever he gets taken, it gives a little beeper in your pocket."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: So, the party then, in trying to locate Grog's position, found their way delving past the lava fall-based element of the obsidian rock duergar Underdark. Deeper into discovering this… cursed… pit of undeath, bone shards, and glass. Upon traversing it they encountered one of these abominations that you've seen traces of left before, this weird, half… partial elven, partial tentacle monstrosity, that slashed through your party, nearly killed Trinket, but was defeated by you."}
{"prompt":"You managed to make your way across this bone field and discover what appears to be a camp, across a number of pillars in the distance. Vax went ahead and stealthed up, looked over and saw that there was a camp of duergar, and apparently the surviving Queen Ulara giving them orders. Next to Grog, who is currently bolted by iron bands to some sort of a cart that they've been dragging him through this tunnel passage with. And that is where we have left off. So.\nTALIESIN: I think I've got a plan.\nSAM: Oh. Because I did, too.\nTALIESIN: You have a plan?\nSAM: No, I want to hear yours. Let's do them both without telling, and just see what happens.\nTALIESIN: I'll Roshambo you for it.\nORION: I actually– I actually like this idea, Scanlan.\nTALIESIN: Keyleth can meld through rock. So, if we can get the attention of everyone who's guarding Grog, she could slip through while we're drawing them out, and get through and let him go in the midst of the fight.\nSAM: That works with my plan.\nTALIESIN: That works with your plan?\nSAM: My plan was to– was to go in there and distract them while you did something!\nLAURA: Perfect plan!\nTALIESIN: I like that plan.\nSAM: I hadn't completed the thought because the something hadn't been worked out.\nTALIESIN: You were 80% there.\nLIAM: Actually, let me tell you all that Grog is up here, you didn't know.\nTALIESIN: I assumed you'd come back by now.\nLIAM: No, I'm still up there.\nSAM: That raises the stakes!\nLIAM: Last week I said, “Come up now.” And that's when he called it.\nORION: And I had already taken off. So I'm already headed there.\nTALIESIN: Well, he's at least said, “Come up now.”\nMARISHA: So we're… we're there.","response":"DM: So Tiberius, roll a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Great… Great, Tiberius, go for it.\nTALIESIN: Damn it.\nLIAM: “Hold on, let me show you my collection of tin cans tied to my tail.”\nORION: Actually, you know what? No, I'm fine, I'll just roll.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, roll the shit out of that.\nORION: 16.","response":"DM: 16? Okay. So, as Tiberius coasts up along the back portion of Vax's arrival point…"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (whispering) Where is everybody?\nLAURA: (whispering) We're on our way.\nORION: (whispering) I don't know. I heard you–","response":"DM: You notice one of the duergar looks over his shoulder in your direction."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And plan over.","response":"DM: And begins to make a few steps in that direction."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait. Who? You?\nSAM: Yeah, he went in anyway.\nLAURA: Yeah, and he's not stealthed enough.\nLIAM: Oh, come up here please…\nLAURA: “Okay!” We stealth. Can I head that way?\nLIAM: And I'm throwing a knife into the dwarf's neck.\nSAM: Oh, Jesus! That's not very stealthy at all!\nLIAM: Well, it's coming over!\nLIAM: He's not waiting!\nSAM: We've been doing this for 30 seconds. We're already in a fight! I was going to distract them!\nLIAM: I'm not going to stand here and wait for the duergar to walk around the corner.\nORION: I was going to distract them, too.","response":"DM: And… you got one of them."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's a classic movie moment.\nSAM: I'm going in. I'm walking into the camp.\nMARISHA: What? Wait, okay, wait. Are we abandoning the plan?\nTALIESIN: No, we're just going for it right now.\nLIAM: Oh my god!\nLAURA: I rolled a nine, so it doesn't even matter.","response":"DM: It doesn't matter at this point."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I rolled a ten, yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, so the rest of you begin trudging in, down this tunnel, towards the edge."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Goddamn.\nLIAM: You know, if you wait five minutes, I can at least take one out.","response":"DM: As Scanlan approaches, the duergar immediately turns around."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hi, duergar!\nLIAM: Right up behind him– (surprise sound effect) Cut his neck, cut the throat.\nMARISHA: I turn into an earth elemental.\nMARISHA: Go, twinsies!\nTRAVIS: Who hits Scanlan?\nSAM: (sighs) Well, the best laid plans….\nLAURA: My first one was an ultimate fail.\nSAM: 12 versus armor class?","response":"DM: Versus your armor class, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm okay!","response":"DM: You pull back and the giant war hammer swings past you and you duck out of the way. Thankfully, though the duergar are relatively small, you're much smaller, and as a gnome you slip right out of the path of the actual hammer blow. Your first arrow misses, second one you said hits?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 25.","response":"DM: 25 definitively hits. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh, why? Why? Oh, I'm cursed today! Eight.","response":"DM: Eight damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Eight damage.\nLIAM: 20. Natural 20!\nTALIESIN: First of the night.\nLIAM: There is a magnet inside this die. I should be– Just full disclosure. Okay, so natural 20.","response":"DM: Yeah. We're buying you new dice next week."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, yeah. Will you buy me new dice as well? Thank you.","response":"DM: So! As you pull Tiberius back, clutching the front of his snout, keeping him quiet, you pull a dagger out, toss it in the air, catch it and fling it at full speed, striking true. Go ahead and roll damage. With sneak attack bonus. Also multiplied because of the crit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes. He's gone, he's gone. Okay, … (mumbles numbers) 47.\nLAURA: I nod to you. Good job.\nSAM: I step forward and say– is her name Ulara?","response":"DM: Ulara. Queen Ulara."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Queen Ulara. Show yourself! Step out and talk to us. Everyone hold.","response":"DM: And the rest of you, are you all staying where you are? Are you coming forward with Scanlan?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, you're talking? We're doing a talking thing?\nLAURA: Let's step up behind him. I want to step up and make him look more imposing with me and Trinket behind him.\nMARISHA: I am– I am going– Hang on, wait, what are you do– what?\nLAURA: I want to step up behind Scanlan with a bear behind him, and make him look more imposing.\nMARISHA: I'm going to… slink back into the shadows and turn into an earth elemental, and sink into the ground.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And hopefully they don't see that happen.","response":"DM: Keyleth… is no longer Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Great way to leave a party.","response":"DM: Kima steps forward, making a point to step angrily onto the corpse of the duergar. You hear the crunching of bone and metal as she steps over his corpse. Percy, you're approaching as well?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm… staying a little bit back.","response":"DM: Okay, so about there?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, about there.\nLIAM: DM?","response":"DM: Yes?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Where on the map is the queen right now?","response":"DM: You don't see right now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Don't see her.\nSAM: She's in the tent. She's in the tent, right?","response":"DM: Grog, which is right over here."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I see what's going on and I rub my ring and I go invisible.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Greater Invisibility.\nSAM: Do I roll again?","response":"DM: I'll say okay, because it is a different skill, so yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Matt, I'd like to move to the other side.","response":"DM: You'll get about there with this round."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 22.","response":"DM: 22?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Fucking love this game.\nLIAM: And they're clearly with her.","response":"DM: They are at her side, like they're ready to defend her."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: They could be charmed.","response":"DM: “Talk, small annoying creature, and perhaps it'll delay the inevitable.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: My friends and I have come–\nLAURA: Hello!\nSAM: Hi, yes… We've come from the above world. The normal world, let's say, to your fine kingdom down here below. And we were on a mission. We're a bit of– I don't want to brag, but we're a bit of an elite task force, sent in by kingdoms and kings that you probably haven't heard of way down below, but anyway. I'll spare you.","response":"DM: Hold that thought just for a second. Percy, go ahead and roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, shit…. When it's out of the blue like that it's always bad.\nTALIESIN: Ten.","response":"DM: Okay. Continue."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wait. DM. Vax is creeping along the back of that tent and curving around.\nLIAM: Thank you.\nORION: I'm going to do the earring and go to Scanlan and be like, “Keep it simple, will you? I mean, really, calm down.”\nTRAVIS: Yeah, how could you?\nSAM: My lady, we have come on a mission. To save someone that you were holding captive. We have completed our mission, and in the melee, in that hovel you called a palace back there, we lost one of our own, and we would like him back. Now, I'll make it very simple because my fellows are begging me to keep things simple. It's a simple binary choice. You can all die right now, or you can turn over our friend and we will probably, probably leave you in peace. I would promise, but I don't make promises to dogs.\nTRAVIS: (high-pitched) Ooh! Oh snap!\nMARISHA: Oh shit! I move in behind where the pillar is, but in the ground.","response":"DM: Behind where this pillar is, in the ground?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, I'm– yeah, I'm there-ish.\nTRAVIS: I'll die once I finally come back.\nSAM: Saving throw?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What is that?","response":"DM: Roll your saving throw for intelligence."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.\nLIAM: Small square near the top upper left hand.\nTRAVIS: At least I don't have to roll for intelligence.\nSAM: 21.\nLAURA: Do I roll for Trinket, too?\nTALIESIN: 16.","response":"DM: Yes, you do. Okay. Vex."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 14.","response":"DM: Okay. And?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And Trinket is eight.","response":"DM: So, you double over, clutching your skull, as the pain is too much to bear, and you find yourself unable to actually draw commands to your muscles for them to function. You are currently stunned."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Great.","response":"DM: Roll for Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, he rolled an eight.","response":"DM: Trinket falls to the ground with this horrible (bear groan) sound, digging his nose into the actual dirt to try and find a way to escape this piercing mental agony, this psychic damage…"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's pretty shitty, you guys. It sucks.","response":"DM: Both of you guys take 22 points of psychic damage, by the way."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, good. Trinket's about to die again.\nMARISHA: Who's all stunned?\nTALIESIN: Laura, twice.\nORION: Bear and Vex.","response":"DM: Pike also."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And Pike.\nLIAM: DM, I'm throwing a dagger at the queen.","response":"DM: Okay. Now we roll initiative, folks, because stuff has begun."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (fumbling) Can I do something right before that?","response":"DM: No, essentially this triggers the combat now. This was an immediate occurrence. Now we're going into initiative order."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay.\nLIAM: Now, by my saying that, do I get into the initiative order, or does my action come out, my decision come out before?","response":"DM: I would say for the two that didn't act this turn, you guys can have advantage on the initiative roll because you guys have been holding your actions. So Tiberius, you can also have advantage on your initiative roll, since you guys were holding off."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 21.","response":"DM: 21?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Nice, that's better!\nORION: That's way better than a two.\nLAURA: I don't roll anything because I'm stunned?","response":"DM: You are stunned currently. You still roll initiative so we have the order that you go in."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 21.\nTALIESIN: 22.\nMARISHA: Oh are we doing this?","response":"DM: We are."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's on like Tron.\nLAURA: I've got a 13.","response":"DM: Guys, hang on. So 20 to 15?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 22.\nSAM: 18.\nMARISHA: 16 here.","response":"DM: Okay. 15 to ten?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, me. 13.","response":"DM: There we go."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You play stunned well.\nLAURA: I'm not a victim. I'm going to kick butt as soon as I wake up.\nLIAM: 21 over here.\nTALIESIN: We need earth elemental stats if you know where they are, by the way.","response":"DM: Oh, did you not print them out? Monster Manual."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Monster Manual.","response":"DM: Here we go. (funny accent) See, this comes in handy more often than you'd think."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah. But while we're looking that up, I'm basically going to pull my gun, I'm going to fire four times into the face of that awful, awful screaming bastard.","response":"DM: Of the, the mind flayer over here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, the mind flayer.","response":"DM: Okay, so you whip around, he's there in your face, go ahead and make– You're using your action surge to fire two additional times, you said?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, wow, four rounds. Go for an attack."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: First attack with Pepperbox is 13?","response":"DM: 13? Unfortunately misses. Form shifts (whooshing sounds), and you can feel the psychic energy of its oppressive mental force, causing your hand to miss its aim with each pull of the trigger."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's my fire shot… so that's…\nTRAVIS: Put it on him, Percy, let's go.\nTALIESIN: Oh my god, this sucks! Eight points of damage. What is this about?","response":"DM: Okay. Third attack?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Third attack.","response":"DM: Spin the barrel again on the Pepperbox (gunshot)."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Natural 20.\nTRAVIS: Get on it!\nLAURA: Murder him!\nTALIESIN: That's 11 points of damage.\nMARISHA: Is it doubled?\nTALIESIN: That's 2d10. I double the dice, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: Or roll and double the dice number, but that's fine. Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So that's that. And now I'm going to take a sharpshooter bonus, so… Oh, that sucks. That's 11, that doesn't hit.","response":"DM: Unfortunately. So the first one hits, the second one actually clips part of its chest and you can see, as it tries to use its psychic abilities to resist the bullet, it still pierces its chest in the side. Missing everything vital, still causing it to (makes painful hissing sound), sucks in the air for a moment."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That was a terrible roll. I'm going to use some movement to dodge left to get out of the way of that guy.","response":"DM: Okay. So going this way?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to go… Yeah, about there.","response":"DM: Okay, cool. Probably should get out the laser pointers."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'll bring him one.\nSAM: Hey, is Grog stone?\nLIAM: Grog's tied. Grog is held by iron bands. He's down.\nTRAVIS: Grog's been hitting the peace pipe.\nSAM: He's unconscious.","response":"DM: You guys don't know; you haven't seen him yet."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I saw him, you described it to me last week. He's in iron bands held on a cart.\nLAURA: But he's awake, right?","response":"DM: Yeah, on a cart. You haven't checked."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Iron bands?\nLIAM: Yeah, he's tied down.\nMARISHA: He's on the whole cart though, right?","response":"DM: Tiberius. You're up next."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Great. I peek over the little thing, and I go, “Ooh!” and I throw a fireball from my ring.\nORION: Oh, right in the juicy spot of those three.","response":"DM: Right here?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay. So. As they're all sitting there, looking ready to pounce for this series of battle, all of a sudden there's a slight streak of reddish energy in the distance as you all are watching. It looks almost like the fire pit behind them just explodes in this giant fiery ball of red, angry magical fury. So go ahead and roll your 8d6 damage."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (mumbling numbers) I'm missing d6s.\nTALIESIN: There's two more.\nORION: Wonderful. (mumbles) That's… 31 damage.","response":"DM: 31 points of damage, okay. Queen Ulara you notice, as the duergar are generally considered– as this blasts in this area as well– both her and the duergar make their saving throw; they have magic resistance innately against it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Against magic?","response":"DM: Yeah, they're hardy creatures, man. However! The elf on this side ends up being thrown to the side and its entire body gets thrown about 20-30 feet across from the force of the explosion, landing on the ground lifeless, next to you. (skidding noise) On the ground, a burnt cinder. The dwarf takes the brunt of it as well. Appears to still be alive, but looks very horribly burned and is looking at its hands now like (pained grunting sound). Barely standing."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And then I spend two sorcerer points to (crackling sound effect) form an ice knife.","response":"DM: Before we get to that point, Grog, you also take that damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh. How many points?\nLIAM: He's a freaking sponge. He'll be fine.\nORION: Why?","response":"DM: Because you said you threw it in the fire, there? Grog's right there. On a cart."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I said the juicy spot of those three! I knew Grog was there. Of course I wouldn't throw it there.\nTRAVIS: I can take it.\nORION: Okay, fine.","response":"DM: I pointed here."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, but… I thought– I don't know.","response":"DM: Be specific next time! But yeah, that's okay. He can take it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We're down all of our laser pointers.\nORION: And I throw that, right in the back of Queeny's head.\nMARISHA: Get it. Get some.\nORION: 19.","response":"DM: 19 does hit, even with her mage armor."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sweet. And then that's 1d10. So that's a ten. And then… it (exploding sound effect) shatters, and then does– where the fuck is it– 2d6 damage as well.","response":"DM: Okay, to her and everyone– Go for it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: In a five-foot radius. So yeah…","response":"DM: Right."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And that guy's like right next to her, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (whispering) Hey, Matt. How much damage did I take?","response":"DM: What was the damage on the fireball?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 31.","response":"DM: 31? 31 points of fire damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Cool.\nORION: Cool, and that's four points of damage to both of them.\nLAURA: Are you dead?\nORION: And I have Greater Invisibility, so I'm still invisible and I just peek back behind the rock.\nTRAVIS: (painful roaring)","response":"DM: We'll get to that in a second. Vex. Vax, sorry."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, I'm going to use my feat, Cunning Action, for one extra action per turn of combat, use for either dash, disengage, or hide. So I'm going to double distance and go one… two… three, four, five– I still can't see her– six, maybe… seven, eight, nine, ten. Stop right here by Clarota. (over enunciating) Clarota– Clarota! And dagger, dagger at this jerkface over here.","response":"DM: Right here?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yep.\nLIAM: That was stealthed, by the way.","response":"DM: Right, roll a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And he hasn't gone yet, so for the assassinate feat for rogues, if he hasn't gone yet, this is a critical hit.","response":"DM: In theory, combat already began when he attacked the rest of your party."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: Combat's begun. Sorry."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The feat says if you have the jump, if you go before the person's gone, but we can talk about that later…","response":"DM: Correct, but they've already attacked half your party with the mind blast, so in theory the battle's already begun."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, I didn't hit to– Okay, so that hits. 16 plus– 27.","response":"DM: That definitively hits, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so three… plus (mumbles)\nLAURA: Kill him.\nLIAM: (muttering numbers) 36 total.\nLIAM: Oh, sorry, asswipe! Okay, that is a 19.","response":"DM: 19 does also hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And that is eight damage.\nSAM: Okay, so all that's remaining on the battlefield is the queen and the mind flayer?","response":"DM: The mind flayer, the queen, and this duergar here that has not acted yet."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes! I mean…\nSAM: And just dive at her. Just dive full, head-on, straight for her and bear hug her with Banishment.\nORION: Oh yeah, baby!\nORION: You know you can cast that from a distance?\nSAM: No, you have to– it's touch.\nORION: Is it? Oh!","response":"DM: Yeah, it's a touch spell."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's touch.\nSAM: I do most things through that.","response":"DM: As you charge forward, you pull out your enchanted hand cone and shout the incantation towards her with an angry glare."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ooh, get lost, motherfucker!","response":"DM: It had a DC of 19 for that?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, even with her spell resistance, she does not resist it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's not you it's me.","response":"DM: Is it an intelligence or wisdom save?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh. I don't know things. Target, plane of existence, banishment… I don't know. Where does it say?","response":"DM: It should say what saving throw it is."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Find it.","response":"DM: I will do this for you. On a charisma saving throw or be banished. So, if it was on anything but a charisma saving throw, she would have shrugged it. Charisma, she does not have in spades. As you reach out, she pulls back and you see her beginning to form this crackling bolt of energy you've seen once before in the throne room that shot out and hit multiple members of your party once for a severe amount of damage. This would have been a very dangerous round if you hadn't connected with her right in front of her clavicle. She looks at you with this look of confusion and completely caught-off-guard frustration before her entire form (sucking sound) blinks out of existence and is no longer visible on the board."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Bard ass!\nSAM: Yes!\nSAM: Do I get my bonus?","response":"DM: Yeah!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to give inspiration to Grog because he needs it.\nTRAVIS: Wow.","response":"DM: With that, he looks over to you and gives you a little wink and a smile. Go ahead and take an inspiration dice, which for him is now a d10."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: An upgrade!\nTRAVIS: Heck yeah.","response":"DM: So you can add that inspiration die to any ability checks, any skill checks, saving throws."}
{"prompt":"SAM: For instance, busting through iron bars.\nTRAVIS: Thank you, thank you.\nSAM: She's in a better place.","response":"DM: Keyleth, it's your turn."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (gasps) Oh shit!\nMARISHA: And in rock speak, I say, “Grog it's okay. It's Keyleth”","response":"DM: You hear (makes deep gargled sounds)"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (screams in terror)\nMARISHA: I still don't really grasp that you can't–","response":"DM: It's your first time doing elemental form; you're still trying to figure it out."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Seeing that he's still tied up, I'm going to pick up the whole crate and put him over my– no I'm going to football carry him like this.\nSAM: Is he on something?","response":"DM: He's strapped to a giant cart."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She's carrying the whole thing?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Awesome.","response":"DM: Because earth elemental."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Awesome.","response":"DM: So you're there, now you still have about– what's the speed of?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 30.","response":"DM: 30. So you've got about, say, ten more squares, or I'm sorry ten more feet you can go."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to start football rushing that way.\nMARISHA: Get the fuck out!","response":"DM: You're now being carried by this giant lumbering earth elemental that is just bringing you under its arm. Great! Vex? Do you make your saving throw? Intelligence."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Plus intelligence?","response":"DM: Intelligence saving throw, that should be at the top."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 23!","response":"DM: 23. Using your mind, you shrug off the remainder of the ability. That does end your turn, but you're no longer stunned, which is nice."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's great, that's the end of my turn?","response":"DM: That's the end of your turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do I roll it for Trinket too?","response":"DM: Yes, Trinket as well, thank you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Little Trinket gets the little bitty dice. Oh, I don't think he got it. No, he still rolled an eight.","response":"DM: Yeah, so Trinket's still on the ground, slowly digging his nose into the dirt, trying to find a way to his–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Does that mean he takes more damage?","response":"DM: No more damage, but currently is unable to function."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He's dreaming of honey.\nLAURA: Okay. He's dreaming of pain.","response":"DM: Yeah, very bad news. Okay. That brings us to Pike, who's also going to try and make her saving throw. Fails it, unfortunately. Pike dropped her shield, dropped her mace, and is clutching the side of her head, screaming silently as the pain is wracking her brain from the inside. That brings us to this duergar, who's going to rush over to the one who just banished his queen and attempt to– his physical form begins to swell with strength and frustration. The duergar swings at you with his war pick. That is…"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Cutting Words.","response":"DM: Okay. So it's a 16. Go ahead and roll your d10 number. It's a d10 now."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That's d10?","response":"DM: It's a d10 now. You leveled up, yeah!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: This is a d10?","response":"DM: Yep, so it's a 16."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It was a four.","response":"DM: It was a four, so it takes that down from a 16 to a 12, which does miss."}
{"prompt":"SAM: He misses!","response":"DM: So as he rushes towards you–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So good.\nLIAM: Here comes the illithid.","response":"DM: Not yet. This is going to be, Kima is going to try and make her saving throw. Kima does make it! Does shrug off the effect. Turns around angrily, holding the greatsword that you gave her, staring off at the mind flayer right there. Clarota, however, is going to go ahead and turn this way. Coalesce a giant ball of electrical energy into his hand, and release an arcing blast of lightning energy towards this mind flayer, who does make its saving throw. However, it's still a nice 8d6 lightning damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do they know each other? Are they friends?\nTALIESIN: Not anymore.\nTRAVIS: Soulmates.\nLAURA: I think that guy dated Clarota's ex-girlfriend.","response":"DM: So, 20 points of lightning damage. As the blue energy arcs off, and you see it grounds itself on the incline of this tunnel you guys, have, heading down, the mind flayer visibly is burned, charred, wounded. It looks really really rough. That ends Clarota's turn, Kima's turn. Back to the top of the round. The mind flayer looks at its certain circumstance. Puts its hands together like this, it seems to concentrate…"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I see it, I cast Counterspell! (fwoosh)\nLAURA: That's great.\nLIAM: Come on Tibs. Tibber-hoods.\nSAM: That's nothing, that's no numbers.\nMARISHA: Oh, there we go.\nSAM: That's a good number.\nORION: What is that? 22.","response":"DM: 22? That'll do it. So as this entity you've seen before, they tend to like create this small localized portal into some other plane, and then like step through and vanish. You see it begins to coalesce the same arcane energy, and for a moment you see a spark of some sort of door beginning to open. As Tiberius steps from behind the rock, releases this torrent of sparkling arcane energy that closes the gate entirely and the mind flayer for a second looks confused before it, across the way to wherever it came from and sees nothing."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, so sorry.\nTRAVIS: Are you still invisible?\nTALIESIN: So sad, so sad.","response":"DM: And is going to turn tail and run."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasp) Just running?\nTRAVIS: With his feet?\nLAURA: Can I shoot him?\nSAM: He ran?","response":"DM: Well, yeah essentially levitating away."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Does he have a goofy run?","response":"DM: It's more, its a gliding. it's a (whoosh) About five or six inches off the ground."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Shoot her!","response":"DM: Percy, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shoot him, Percy!\nTALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take a step towards– who's buggering Scanlan over there?","response":"DM: A duergar."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's a duergar? I'm just going to take a shot at him really quick.\nSAM: Don't hit me!","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Not going to hit you.","response":"DM: Hard to see him right now; there's a big tent in the way, if you want to take a step forward, continue moving."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll take a step forward, I'm going to continue moving, this is going to be a running shot.","response":"DM: Okay. So, as you turn, pull your gun off to the side, (explosion) offhand fire–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 18?","response":"DM: 18 does hit."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't like guns.\nTALIESIN: That's– don't go anywhere. That's nine damage.\nTALIESIN: And I'm going to shoot again.\nTALIESIN: 18.","response":"DM: 18. That also hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Bad News.\nTALIESIN: Eight damage. Bad News has not come out yet! This is just my little Pepperbox.\nSAM: Yeah!","response":"DM: You see him gearing up for another two-handed strike down at this tiny gnome character in front of him. The first blow hits the war pick, knocking it out of his hands. He looks over, confused, at you as the second blast hits him right in the side of the face, completely destroying this side of his head entirely. This wet gurgle as the duergar slumps to the ground, almost on top of you, but you step out of the way as his body (boof) hits the ground right there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice. Nice, Percy!\nTALIESIN: Bam.\nLIAM: Where does he get such wonderful toys?!\nTALIESIN: I make them!","response":"DM: That's Percy's turn. Tiberius?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You want to chase them?\nORION: I'm going to slink my way all the way behind the other rock.","response":"DM: Over here?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Towards everybody, closer. Yeah, back, there you go.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to… Yeah, screw it, I'll do another Fireball at the illithid going away. Where do you think you're going? (fwoosh)","response":"DM: So, as you fire this beam over here, it detonates in the distance, safely far enough away from the party. Go ahead and roll damage for that fireball. As the mind flayer that is drifting away glances over its shoulder, you see its greenish glowing eyes go wide for a second, cartoon-style, \"Oh, shit!”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Did you go, “Fireball!” as you do it? Hadouken!","response":"DM: And, with its advantage against the spell– it's a dexterity save, correct?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, so that's–","response":"DM: Doesn't make it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 19.\nORION: Yep.","response":"DM: Okay, as the mind flayer's drifting away, you guys see this arc of red, beaming energy (whoosh) off in the distance. (explosion) You see rocks cascade off the top of the wall, hitting the ground with a force as the entire tunnel shakes and rocks. As the smoke and the flames dissipate, all you see is this pile of blackened creature on the ground from where the mind flayer once stood."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, peace out! Mind gobbler.\nLAURA: Is that everybody's?\nSAM: Fellows! Gather around. She might come back at any moment and we should be here to surround her when she comes back.\nLAURA: Okay, yeah.\nSAM: And someone get Grog out of that thing!\nORION: Oh, crap, I forgot about that one.\nLAURA: Yeah, how do we get Grog out?","response":"DM: Grog."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What?","response":"DM: While they're all doing this, what do you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well, am I still chained up to the cart?","response":"DM: Yeah, these iron bands are across your entire body."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Being carried by an earth elemental.\nTRAVIS: Excuse me, giant rock thing. Could you perhaps get me out of this shit?\nLIAM: I start hiking back towards Grog.\nLAURA: Pike and Trinket, are they still stunned, or are they… better?","response":"DM: They've shrugged it off by now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Then I run over and try to see what I can do.","response":"DM: Ulara still can't make her saving throw for the life of her, even with resistance."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I go try to mess with the things on–","response":"DM: Oh, yeah. As you guys approach, and begin making your way up to the front here, grab these duergar."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I'll move on the other side of that rock so I can see better and have line of sight.","response":"DM: Over here?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, on that side, yeah.\nLAURA: Grog! Are you hurt?\nTRAVIS: I can't tell yet.\nTALIESIN: I'm keeping my distance.","response":"DM: There?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: I'm still in this wonderful therapeutic chair.","response":"DM: So you go ahead and you try and pull the bars off? Is that what you're doing? What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are they bars?","response":"DM: They're iron bands that surround you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Don't want to hurt him.\nTRAVIS: But it's a wooden cart? Is it a wooden cart?\nLAURA: Maybe bust the wood on the bottom.\nTRAVIS: Or just smash the cart.\nSAM: Or he can pick a lock.\nLIAM: It's what I do.\nMARISHA: Oh, is there a lock on the bars? Yeah.","response":"DM: Yeah, there's an intricate lock mechanism."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Try that first before I suplex Grog.\nTRAVIS: Thank you.","response":"DM: Cracks a little bit in the process."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: “Give me a little space. Let me look at this.” Can I detect traps on his bands?\nSAM: Checking for traps?! She could come back at any second, hurry up!\nLAURA: I keep my arrow notched.\nLIAM: That's a 17.\nLAURA: In case she does come back.","response":"DM: 17?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay. They appear to be just general locks."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And are there locks contraptions on them?","response":"DM: There is a lock on them, yes. So go ahead and make your–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 19.","response":"DM: 19. (tink) The band that's part way across the waist opens freely on the hinge on the one side."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Was there just one?","response":"DM: Yeah, that was the one."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (groans in relief) Oh my god!","response":"DM: So go ahead and make an athletics check. I mean, there's multiple bands around you. Across your shoulders, your torso, your legs, your ankles."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to move on to the next one.\nTRAVIS: 25.\nLIAM: And a 25 on my lock pick.","response":"DM: Okay, you get a second band. You rolled a 25? And Marisha, do you want to go ahead and make an athletics check as well? Or that would be a strength check for you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: For what?","response":"DM: For your form, your elemental form, to try and pull the bands off of Grog."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: Unless you want to do something else."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to recommend to Pike that she do a bit of healing.\nLAURA: Oh, Pike! Can you heal Trinket. He's really almost dead.\nSAM: Is Pike okay?","response":"DM: Pike comes over and spends a 3rd-level healing spell."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I failed.\nLAURA: You failed what?\nTALIESIN: Life. Oh wow! Yeah, you did.\nMARISHA: Strength check.","response":"DM: Okay, Trinket heals 21."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, good.\nLIAM: Vax is moving to the next band. That's a 24.\nTRAVIS: I got a 25, does that not help?","response":"DM: Yeah, between the two of you, over the next few seconds or so, you pick the next one and with that remaining push, you force the rest of the bands off. Grog, you make your way up to your feet."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (groans in relief)","response":"DM: There we go! At that point in time, there's a slight ripple in the space right before this fire pit, and in that place Ulara, Queen Ulara, reappears again."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hold her!\nLAURA: I've been waiting for it.\nMARISHA: Can I grab her?\nORION: Wait, can I do something? Can we react to this?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I see it and I cast Hold Person.\nLAURA: I release an arrow!\nSAM: I also cast Hold Person.\nLAURA: 29.","response":"DM: 29? Okay, that does hit. You can see now, the second set of shackles spins around her, she brings her hand up like this and they just scatter around her, resisting a second Hold Person. Now all her saving throws are coming through."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I just grab her as an earth elemental. Just like (mumbles with a deep voice).","response":"DM: If you want to."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: So, damage on the attack?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I Hunter's Mark her, as well.","response":"DM: Oh there you go. See that, chatroom?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What is that? 13?\nLIAM: 12.\nLAURA: 12! Plus… That's 16 total.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to take a headshot with Bad News.\nLIAM: Wait!\nTALIESIN: Oh, are you doing something?\nLAURA: We need to talk to her.\nTALIESIN: Okay.\nMARISHA: I bear hug her.","response":"DM: Okay, so go ahead and make an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Athletics, I don't have that.","response":"DM: I know, it's just a strength check, then. Roll a d20 and add your strength modifier."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ooh, that's better! 23.","response":"DM: 23. You bound up behind her and as she looks over her shoulder, the arrow piercing her shoulder. She's looking pretty rough, you can see the blood beginning to pool underneath her robe there. Her eyes go wide."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It would be in your best interest to not struggle.\nSAM: We have everything that we have come here for. What can you possibly offer us that we don't already have?","response":"DM: “Valid point. What purpose do I serve? You should let me go.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let you go?! I tried to talk to you and you almost tried to get us killed!\nLIAM: Vox Machina, our purposes here are done, but Lady Kima, she has further to go, and I am curious, your Highness, if you know anything about this K'Varn chap or gal or thing? We have heard his or her name. They seem to be famous in these parts. I was wondering if you know anything about K'Varn.","response":"DM: Are you rolling Persuasion for this?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes, I am. So well. That's a two.\nLAURA: So bad.","response":"DM: She goes, “I know many things.” And she leans forward a little bit and then spits right in your face."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Wonderful. Clarota, do you want to suck her mind?\nMARISHA: I tighten my grip on her a bit.\nLIAM: Vex'ahlia, would you come up and talk to this–\nLAURA: I'm already here.","response":"DM: Clarota, at which steps forward and brings his hand up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, that's true. We don't need her, we just need her brain.","response":"DM: As Clarota steps forward, putting his hand out, this voice echoes through all of your minds communally. “Now… tell us what you know.” And you see his eyes flicker with a strange blue energy."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, Professor X.\nTALIESIN: Man's got to eat.","response":"DM: And you see Ulara's eyes glaze over and fill with the same blue arcane energy that Clarota was briefly having drift out of his eyes. Ulara stops struggling and the mouth goes into this weird grin for a second and just calmly says, “Liberation. Liberation is what it brings us. Liberation from physical limitation. Liberation from the pain of the light.” And she looks up as she says that. “We all shall rise. K'Varn, the Guiding Darkness. The sun shall hold no sway and we shall walk the surface once again.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: What is all this poppycock?!\nLAURA: What is K'Varn?","response":"DM: “K'Varn came to us, showed us how through unification we could be better than we ever were.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I didn't ask what he did, I asked what he is.","response":"DM: “K'Varn–” At which point, there's a shudder in her body and her eyes go from this strange blue color to this strange swimming black that covers the entirety of each eye. At which point, she shakes for a second. Her shoulders shift and you clutch her in your arms. As you do, you see the blackness now has that same green glow that the rest of them had, but it's framing the pools of shadow that her eyes have become. Her jaw falls slack for a second and this voice comes through. “Ah, there! (chuckles) There we are. I can see you all so clearly.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Not me!","response":"DM: “You'd be surprised, dragonborn.”"}
{"prompt":"(all gasp)\nORION: You're pretty good.","response":"DM: “Word has reached my ears, but to see you, to look upon you, is everything. Come. You are close, yes? Come to me, as my guests. I invite you. The temple doors are open. I'd like to see you in person.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: (stammers) Can you be more specific? Like, do we go left, or right, or… specific.","response":"DM: “You're already on the right path. Come to me. You are my treasured guests.” At which point, the blackness in the eyes begins to intensify and begin to spill like black tears from the face. Her body shudders before the back convulses, and then falls limp, a little bit of smoke rising from the mouth."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I check her pulse.","response":"DM: She has definitely given up the ghost."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Try to heal her?\nLAURA: Does she have anything awesome on that we can take?\nTALIESIN: I wasn't going to say it.\nSAM: You're looting her already?!\nTALIESIN: I was waiting for someone else to say it.\nLIAM: What a mercenary.\nLAURA: Is she dead? Can we take her outfit?\nLIAM: Vax'ildan is going to go pick at the charred remains of the illithid.\nSAM: I'm going into the tent to look.\nORION: I want to check out the queen.","response":"DM: Okay. You go and check out the charred remains. They are charred. They are remains. There is what looks to be about 86 gold on the body, but most anything of use has been charred or destroyed. There is the remnants of a breastplate that is burned over that most of the mind flayers use as a basic form of protection. As you inspect her body, as the earth elemental drops her (boof) with a thud to the ground–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I rolled an 18 for arcana, and you know I wanted to check for–","response":"DM: Okay. You do notice there's a silver circlet across her forehead that does give off a magical aura. She carries on her one viscous, reddish potion that is familiar to you in the healing accoutrement of various potions you've had in the past. It is a potion of greater healing."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, and we haven't used the yellow potion yet.\nTRAVIS: And nobody ever drank that?\nORION AND LAURA: No.","response":"DM: There is another potion that has almost a blue, frosty color to it as you take the vial from where it sits in the rest. The actual glass that contains the liquid has a layer of frost crystals around it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to remember that you're the one who suggests drinking random, yellow liquids and I'm going to bring you a vial of yellow liquid. I'm just saying.","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Me? Yeah, sorry.\nLAURA: Can I also check– We already checked the queen? You already checked the queen?","response":"DM: He's almost done with checking the queen."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we check the elf and the dwarf that we knocked out, as well?","response":"DM: Yes, you can."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And can I ask Pike to heal me, because I look like a game of tic-tac-toe?\nLAURA: I know, we should check on Grog.\nTRAVIS: Oh, no, don't think of me, please. I've only been fucking missing for two weeks.\nLAURA: You're standing up? I'm so happy you're back with us.","response":"DM: What'd you roll on investigation?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 13.","response":"DM: 13? Okay. You can't seem to find anything out of the remains of the mind flayer, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I drop my earth elemental form.","response":"DM: Okay. (shoomf) The earth around your form seems to crumble, like a layer of rock. It hits the ground and dissolves into the stone beneath you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: See? I told you it was Keyleth.\nMARISHA: Were you watching, Grog? Grog, you weren't watching.\nTRAVIS: No, totally was. It was amazing what you did. Could you do it again?\nMARISHA: After we take a short rest.\nSAM: Anything in the tent?","response":"DM: You check inside. It looks like there's some traveling blankets, some furs. You do also find a small case that contains a bunch of empty vials. There is one filled vial. A very large vial."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (whispers) Can you fucking heal me, please? Can you please heal me?\nSAM: What the hell?\nORION: I place the circlet on my head.\nLAURA AND SAM: What is it?\nLIAM: Probably a cursed item.","response":"DM: You can't have it with an Ioun Stone either, by the way. It's one or the other."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (stammering) I thought that was a…","response":"DM: It's a head slot."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And for Ioun Stones I can have up to three in the head slot?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay.\nMARISHA: Maybe give it to Scanlan. Scanlan, do you have anything in your head slot?\nSAM: “Just my cunning wit!” I don't even know what a head slot is.\nLAURA: It's where a hat goes.\nORION: Then for the time being, I take off the Ioun Stone and I (fzzt) dissipate it and… put it on.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, can you share?\nORION: This essentially allows me to–","response":"DM: Anyone who wears it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (stammering) Anyone who wears it can maintain two concentration spells for two rounds.\nLAURA: Oh, that's great for you.","response":"DM: It's great for a lot of people."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Did I find anything on the other people?\nTRAVIS: Thank you, Kima.","response":"DM: You look through the bodies. It looks like most of their adornments, other than the natural armor and weapons they have, nothing of particular interest. Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, wait, I get to go twice because it's Underdark. That was great. 16.","response":"DM: Okay. 16? Yeah, you're not able to really pull anything from their bodies, unfortunately. However, after Kima finishes healing you, Kima walks over to the dwarf corpse as you're inspecting it and gives it a look-over and shakes her head."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What do you see, Kima?","response":"DM: (sighs) “This was one of my companions.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) Oh, no.","response":"DM: “Well, judging by the scars across his body, he had already been made a thrall of one of the illithid. Most likely the one that we finished back there.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Killed her friend?\nLAURA: He was already a thrall.","response":"DM: “There wasn't much to really bring him back at this point, I fear.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is that what they would've done to Grog?","response":"DM: And as you guys all look at Grog now, you can see him, he has hundreds upon hundreds of small scars across his body: fresh wounds that have just barely sealed. It looks like they've done a number on him with a bunch of small blades, hooks, razors– it's hard to tell. But he is coated with small cuts."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's been interesting.\nLAURA: You look really manly now.\nTRAVIS: Now?","response":"DM: You guys can short rest if you want to heal yourselves with your hit dice."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is the time for an intermission.\nLAURA: Oh, it is?\nLIAM: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Is it? What time is it?\nORION: It's 8:24.\nSAM: It's only just begun.\nMARISHA: I wanted to talk to my team. Can we talk now or talk after break? It's up to you.\nSAM: Let's talk now.\nLIAM: Vax is walking off into the distance to urinate on a stalagmite or stalactite, whatever's the one on the ground.\nMARISHA: Well, we'll wait for Vax to get back.\nSAM: We'll bring him up to speed later.\nTRAVIS: Just talk loudly.\nMARISHA: Well, I don't– Where's Kima?\nLAURA: She's right here.","response":"DM: Kima's with you. Kima's still looking over the body of the dwarf that's fallen."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Speak!\nLIAM: Oh, that's a relief! Oh!\nLAURA: (whispering) Do you not want to talk in front of Kima?\nMARISHA: (whispering) I don't want to talk in front of Kima. (speaking) Kima? Earmuffs, Kima.\nLAURA: No, that's awkward.\nTRAVIS: You want me to distract her?\nLIAM: It's the longest pee ever.\nTRAVIS: I'll distract her! I'll distract Kima.\nLAURA: Grog goes and distracts Kima.\nSAM: I might be better at that. Kima, can you take a walk with me? I would like to persuade you to take a walk with me.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll persuasion."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 24.","response":"DM: Okay. Kima gives you a concerned look and goes–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: There's this thing on my body. I thought maybe you could take a look at it and you could tell me if it's good or bad? I don't know.","response":"DM: “Oh dear. No, please.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Scanlan, do not drop the mack.","response":"DM: And the two of you begin to walk away for a moment, away from the party. Briefly, while the rest of you are left behind."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Scanlan, do you have an earring?\nSAM: I have an earring.\nMARISHA: Okay, so Scanlan can hear.\nSAM: I use my Minor Illusion to create a purple third nipple on me that I show her and ask her if it's okay, or if it's–","response":"DM: Okay, things are getting a little weird."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is this normal?","response":"DM: “None of this is normal. At all.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's just, I trust you. I feel like I know you. You know we had that thing back there and then Keyleth was yelling at you. What was that all about?","response":"DM: “We're all under duress.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's girl talk.\nMARISHA: I think we should get out of here.\nLAURA: What? Why?\nMARISHA: Well, we've got Grog. We've got Kima. We came here to find Kima. That was our mission. I don't trust her.\nLAURA: We found her, but we can't leave without her.\nLIAM: So I'm walking back from my pee and I've overheard this. “We were sent here to bring back Kima.”\nLAURA: And now you want to abandon her?\nLIAM: She's not going to come with us until we've killed this K'Varn.\nLAURA: Keyleth, what's your problem with Kima?\nMARISHA: Well, look. She's been… She just gave me the wrong vibe, up front.\nLAURA: Okay, vibe. What did she do?\nMARISHA: She's been very rude–\nLAURA: She's been very tortured. Tortured, Keyleth.\nMARISHA: Right. But look what happened. She's brought countless people down here, only to meet their end.\nORION: Well, none of those people are us.\nMARISHA: Right.\nLAURA: They're dead because they got captured. We're stronger.\nLIAM: Do you know something we don't, Keyleth?\nMARISHA: Look, all I know is that only a fool believes that his path is the most virtuous. See? And he's got an intelligence of six.\nLIAM: I want to use my– I would like to do a check on Keyleth.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I want to see her intentions.\nTRAVIS: (squealing) Ooh, inside-the-group check! I love it!\nLIAM: It's a 14.\nTRAVIS: The whisper! The first whisper!\nORION: It's really nice.\nLAURA: I can't cheat, but I really want to listen.\nTRAVIS: What was that shit about now I'm manly?\nLAURA: You are manly. I meant more manly.\nSAM: Hey everyone, buy a t-shirt! Subscribe to Geek & Sundry. Support Felicia Day.","response":"DM: As you finish your statement as well, Keyleth, Clarota steps up and says, “I wholeheartedly agree. She is unstable and cannot be trusted in her state.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hold on a second, that's unfair.\nMARISHA: Why?\nLIAM: It has been a long road. Keyleth, I know you have had a hard time. We all have. I know we're miles below the surface of the world. But we're together. We are family. And everyone here is here for you as you have been for us. Now, I say we camp for the night inside this schmuck's tent. We stay here, we rest up, sleep on it, and see how we're all feeling in the morning. We're here for you, Keyleth, and we'll protect you as you have protected us. You've got a family with us.\nMARISHA: (crying) How do we know we are doing the right thing? We've killed a lot of people, you guys. We've killed a lot of people.\nLIAM: Who in this world is without fault? Who hasn't made mistakes? We certainly all have.\nLAURA: Keyleth, we're keeping him, K'Varn, from killing even more.\nMARISHA: How do we know we're not just interfering with issues that aren't our own? We didn't know any of this until we came down here, and look she wants to take the horn. She wants the horn, and she wants to take it back herself.\nLIAM: The bottom line is, all of this insanity is going to bubble up to the surface if someone doesn't stop it.\nLAURA: All those creatures that have been coming up, Keyleth?\nLIAM: Remember, think back. It has already begun, and no one is here to stop it except for Vox Machina. Us.\nTALIESIN: We promise, we will heed your warning, but we can't run. We will heed it, though.\nLIAM: We've got your back.","response":"DM: “We made a deal.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And we made a deal.\nLAURA: We did make a deal.\nMARISHA: I understand you, Clarota, and I'm on your side. I swear. But a lot of people– there have been a lot of murderers who said they did the things that they did because their gods told them to do it. Right?\nTALIESIN: We'll be cautious, and we'll have you to protect us.\nORION: I dissipate invisible, and I approach Keyleth. “Your Highness. By the honor of all Stormwinds, I will let nothing happen to you. I swear it. I will fight until my death, and I have ways, of course, to get us all out of here whenever I damn well please. Do not worry.”\nMARISHA: I just have a bad feeling. This horn can't make it back up to the surface. You guys have to promise me that.\nLAURA: We'll keep the horn from leaving.\nMARISHA: She wants to take it back. Why? If it's that bad, why does she want it?\nTALIESIN: The god in darkness will blot out the light.\nMARISHA: I just hope we're not the darkness.\nORION: Oh, do you need light? (fwoosh)\nMARISHA: Oh, god.\nORION: Oh, is that– I'm sorry\nLAURA: Thanks, Tiberius.","response":"DM: “I'm not sure what this is. I'm sorry.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: “There's one more thing I need you to look at, it's just…” I cast Polymorph on myself, giving myself a gigantic dick, and I slowly pull down my pants…","response":"DM: Kima immediately turns around and says, “Okay!” And walks back to the group."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What did I say? You can't keep it in for two seconds. Not that I blame you! My god!\nLIAM: I think we are all a little frayed. I think we need to rest. Let's set up camp.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, let's camp.","response":"DM: Kima steps in at this point and says, “I agree. (sigh) We have quite a journey ahead of us.” At which point, Clarota pipes up and says, “Indeed. We're not too far from Yug'Voril. Let us rest.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Kima. I… just wanted to apologize.","response":"DM: “What for?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I came across too harshly that night.","response":"DM: She puts her hand up and… in a matronly way. “It's honestly not a worry. War is stressful, and all of us have been through a lot for this experience. I understand. I've been where you've been, and it's not uncommon to question everything around you, and with good reason: that's what keeps you alive. Were you to believe every person that crossed your path, you would not have made it past your 15th season. I can assure you, as best as I can, that I mean the best for all of us. I just know that if we don't do what we're here to do, far more people will suffer than the few I've brought down here to protect me and for me to protect. I'm not asking for your trust. I'm just asking for your patience.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well, I can grant you that. Only if you promise to grant us respect in return, because I feel you were a little untrusting of what we were doing up front, which I once again understand.","response":"DM: “You caught me at a rough time.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Same here.","response":"DM: “Well, thank you.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm sorry, Scanlan, what is that?\nSAM: Oh, this bulge down here?\nTRAVIS: Could you un-Polymorph your tripod, for god's sake?\nORION: Before we go to sleep, I cast a bunch of spells in stuff.\nLIAM: We will be here every week, so subscribe.","response":"DM: Also, t-shirts on sale, as of today. They are a limited run for two weeks. We are trying to get to our goal of 1,000 before that's done, hopefully. So you can just scroll down to the bottom of the Twitch page; you'll find a button there that will get you to that shop. So go for it!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait! Also, the PayPal is working again, for donations.\nSAM: I check under my belt because the spell has worn off. And I'm back down to my normal one and a half inches. Which on a gnome is pretty big.\nLAURA: Thank you.\nSAM: Length! And girth.\nLAURA: Oh god, what?\nSAM: It's like a square. Like a cube.","response":"DM: Anyway, you guys eventually come to consciousness and finish cooking whatever bits of food you've managed to muster at this point in time in the Underdark."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's doughnuts.","response":"DM: Yeah, it is doughnuts. Under-doughnuts."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And Indian food, apparently.\nTALIESIN: Under-Indian.","response":"DM: By the way, all of those who contributed to getting us food tonight, thank you so much."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Thank you!","response":"DM: Clarota seems slightly impatient as everyone is waking up and goes, “Come! Ahead, we shall find it's Yug'Voril.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's your city?","response":"DM: “Beautiful city of secrets.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I thought your people had thrown you out. Why so eager to get back?","response":"DM: “Without the colony, I serve no purpose. I am wandering, aimless. I wish to return to the Elder Brain.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And to be fair, he was only thrown out once K'Varn took over the Elder Brain. Correct?","response":"DM: “No. They threw me out long before, for my gift.” And you see a little spark of arcane blue filter out of his fingers in the air and then (poof). Small spark. “It is an abomination to my people. I am considered anathema. But to save them! To save my city, then they shall have me back a hero.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And if they don't?","response":"DM: “They will. I can sense it.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, yes, it makes perfect sense, Clarota. I would think they would grant you a hero's welcome, as well.\nLAURA: If not, you have a home with us.","response":"DM: “Thank you. Forward, we will find shrouded in the forest of fungus our destination. Come.” It begins to drift down into the dark tunnel further below."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We follow.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we follow.\nORION: I follow behind them and call out to him, “Are you using Levitation, or what? How are you– is this how you–”","response":"DM: “It's how we get around, dragonborn.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, okay.","response":"DM: His tentacles flicker at his face for a second. As you guys continue forward in silence, K'Varn seems to be more chatty than usual, almost like the proximity is– this is excitement to him, instinctually."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Did you mean Clarota? You said K'Varn.","response":"DM: I meant Clarota."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Slip of the tongue!\nTRAVIS: I was like, “oh shit.”\nLAURA: See, he slipped-of-the-tongue before and he screwed us over with a sneaky-sneaky!","response":"DM: It's been a long week. I know. Sorry. As Clarota drifts, “Our people, we are a structured society. Together we provide for each other. Broken into creeds, we function rather pleasantly.” And he drifts forward again at full pace."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Clarota seems pretty excited to get home. I'm worried for him.\nLIAM: Worried for him?\nLAURA: Yes.\nLIAM: What, for his effect on the group?\nLAURA: I'm worried that they won't take him back, what that will do to his state.\nLIAM: Well, the bottom line is, (sighs) we have a pretty clear goal at hand. Everything else will have to be figured out afterward.\nORION: I still follow Clarota. I'm like, “So is it– do you do it with your mind, or is it just like– were you all taught as a child to be able to levitate, because it seems–”","response":"DM: “It's inherent, much like your gifts. It's just how we get around.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Good to know. Understood.\nTALIESIN: K'Varn, the god in darkness. I want to wrack my brain to think if I've ever had any lessons or if that name has ever come up in any of my reading.\nTALIESIN: History check?\nLIAM: A super history check.\nTALIESIN: No whammies. That's a 13.","response":"DM: 13? The name is as fresh to you as it was the day you heard it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, fiddlesticks.\nTRAVIS: I walk over to Lady Kima and I say, “How's that greatsword been treating you?”","response":"DM: She walks and she's using it almost like a stick in the dirt as she takes a step. “You know, it's served its purpose so far, I just (sighs) I wish… I wish that vault wasn't lost. Leather isn't my idea of defensive.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Would you fancy a trade, Kima? I have elven chainmail, if that would help you.","response":"DM: “Perhaps?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I could take that leather armor off your hands?\nSAM: But you'll be vulnerable, won't you?\nLAURA: No, actually. The chainmail isn't right for me.\nORION: Stick figure!\nTRAVIS: Got it! Got it. We're good.","response":"DM: “Perhaps we'll find a more modest place to swap, but yes, I agree.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Dang it, I should've done that before we–\nSAM: I can make you a modest spot to change?\nLIAM: Grog, are you skinning a boar over there? What are you doing?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, that's what they call it in some countries.","response":"DM: Some of you summon the stapler straw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Summon the staples!\nORION: Am I mistaken? You're really damaged still?\nLIAM: We slept!","response":"DM: Yeah, you guys all slept overnight."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm up to full, yeah.\nORION: So, the scars are…?\nLAURA: The scars are cool!","response":"DM: I mean, the visual scars are still there but he's at full hit points. They're healing slowly."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, don't you fix these.\nORION: As I notice, I go, “Anybody with (mumbling) knowledge of medicine should give a whack at cleaning some of those.”\nSAM: Oh, you know what, though? Before we go any further, I remind Pike that Vax's foot damage needs daily repair, doesn't it?","response":"DM: “Oh! Yes, of course!” She comes over and you guys take a slight break as Pike comes and sets you down."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's not pretty to look at.\nLAURA: She's seen it already, brother.","response":"DM: “Oh, I've seen worse.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Wait, what happened to your foot?\nLAURA: It got melted off. Aw, come on, not again!\nLIAM: It's fine, except the pinkie toe.\nLAURA: He's got a little pinkie nubbin!\nLIAM: Pinky toe's a nubbin now, yeah\nTRAVIS: You know, we could just take care of the whole thing right now, if you want.\nORION: No, Grog, that defeats the purpose.\nLIAM: I need Percy to make me a replacement first.\nTALIESIN: Make a little metal toe?\nLIAM: Pike, could you hook a brother up?","response":"DM: “Certainly.” She sets the foot down, she begins to gather up her runes, and she's casting a 4th-level spell."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: She should've done it before we went to sleep.","response":"DM: Aye, but alas, she's not here. Sorry, Ashley. So that would be the equivalent of about 32 hit points. She's also going to attempt a medicine roll, as well. Okay. You notice there is some progress that is slow, but some of the burn scarring from the dip in the magma is beginning to slowly subside. Fresh skin is beginning to show, but it's still pretty rough."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It still smells amazing, so if you could just–\nTRAVIS: It does smell amazing, actually.\nSAM: It's like a weasel on your leg.\nLAURA: Clarota, are we planning on going to your village before we go see K'Varn, or are we going after K'Varn first? I'm confused.","response":"DM: “K'Varn resides within the city, the temple.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, is he a mind flayer, then? I mean, is he like you?","response":"DM: “I have not seen him myself, since I was cast out before he took the star, took my people under his spell.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Just to be clear, the temple of what?","response":"DM: He leans forward for a second. “The temple. We don't know its original purpose. The city we acquired, we found, we took root. Yug'Voril existed long before our colony did.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. That's good to know. That's very good to know. Thank you.","response":"DM: “Very well…” He continues floating forward. The air, still chilly, with steadily more and more moisture. The rock walls become less and less jagged, growing smoother from endless years of condensation, mineral drip, and slow erosion. Begin to give that smooth inner cave look to the outsides of this tunnel."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: As we walk, Vax falls in next to Keyleth. “Keyleth?”\nMARISHA: Yes? What?\nMARISHA: I'm doing okay.\nLIAM: You are?\nMARISHA: Yeah. Why?\nLIAM: Everything we said last night was true. We're here for you.\nMARISHA: I'm here for you, too.\nTALIESIN: We're having a discussion of how best to go about this.\nLAURA: While that happens, can I use my Primeval Awareness to sense if I sense any dragons in the city coming up in front of us?","response":"DM: Certainly. As you're walking, the group slows with you, as you have to really maintain concentration on this. You close your eyes and you consider. You sense no sources of dragon within the radial of your ability to sense in this cavern structure."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are our feet leaving footprints?","response":"DM: Subtle ones, but yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Son of a bitch! Dust of Tracelessness everywhere!\nTRAVIS: Good!\nTALIESIN: Missed our little flower girl.\nMARISHA: I know! So glad we have him back.\nTALIESIN: I want to just put something out on the headsets really quickly. “When we get into the city, I need everyone to promise that we're not going to enter the temple. No one rush in, no one be brash. No one make a poor decision. We're going to wait. No matter what happens, don't enter the temple until we've all had a moment to figure out what's happening.”\nLIAM: No one be a yahoo.\nORION: Agreed.\nMARISHA: I think it's a trap.\nTALIESIN: If there's going to be a trap, it's going to be getting us into the temple.\nMARISHA: He wants us. He wants us there.\nTALIESIN: He literally invited us into the temple.\nLAURA: So don't go to the temple.\nTALIESIN: We walk to the temple, we don't enter the temple.\nLAURA: So enter the temple. Understood.\nTALIESIN: Understood. Excellent.","response":"DM: At this point, beginning to notice the tunnel itself, the cavern, is swaying back and forth a little bit with this. As opposed to a straight path, the tunnel is beginning to arc left and right. There's little pockets and crevices beginning to show at certain points, and you start seeing small bits of bluish crystal jutting in small pockets out of cracks in the rock."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Did you say that there was mushrooms? A mushroom forest, a fungus?","response":"DM: Clarota yesterday mentioned a fungal forest."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But we haven't seen it yet. But we're starting to go into the crystal caverns.","response":"DM: Starting to find bluish crystals, which Pike makes a motion. “Yes, I saw this in my vision, too!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I touch some of the crystals? Are they removable?","response":"DM: You reach out and touch the crystal. As you do, go ahead and– no."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Dick move!\nTRAVIS: I love it.\nLAURA: The greed! The greed gets me.\nMARISHA: Does it appear to be producing cold?","response":"DM: No, the temperature doesn't seem different at all to the air. There doesn't seem to be a source at all; it's the same temperature as the rest of the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to figure out what kind of crystal this may be?","response":"DM: Yeah, sure."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Tiberius, these look like the crystals on your staff.\nORION: “Hm? Oh, ooh, yes! They're pretty.” I take out one of my daggers– yes, I do have daggers– and (clicking noise) I'm going to chip away a couple of chunks.\nTALIESIN: Actually, let's grab a few chunks. I may have an idea for later.\nTALIESIN: Throw a few into the Bag of Holding.\nORION: Oh, yeah, okay. (mumbling) 14.","response":"DM: 14? Okay. It's hard-pressed to find out where these crystals came from, what their source is, or if they naturally are here or if they're put there through some other means, but the crystals do have a very, very faint magical residual energy to them. Useless, almost. It's the equivalent of finding crumbs at the bottom of a cereal box. It's there. You can see at one point there was something magical about their presence or their creation, but it is long faded."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Cool. Sweet.\nTRAVIS: Do you still want more of them?\nTALIESIN: I'll take a few.\nTRAVIS: I go Hong Kong Phooey on the wall of crystals with my axe and I just (snarling).\nTALIESIN: Thank you!","response":"DM: When the noise dies down, you gather shards and pieces. Probably enough to fill a small bucket. You can indeed fill your small bucket, should you have one. That is your prerogative, Grog."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I don't, but I have a fancy robe. And I put it in there and I bundle it up.","response":"DM: Okay! If you had a stick, you could be a crystal hobo."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A fancy bundle of crystals.\nMARISHA: We also have a fancy Bag of Holding.\nLAURA: It's in the bag. It's all in the bag.","response":"DM: About a half an hour further down this tunnel, both Vax and Vex simultaneously notice a part of the wall to the left that is actually visibly cracked and what appears to be almost a narrow passage that juts off to the left. However, there is a large boulder, solid stone, that is wedged into this. Apparently blocking the passage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Grog, we need you over here.\nTRAVIS: What?\nLAURA: Could you possibly move this very large, very heavy boulder for us?\nLIAM: Scanlan, you as well.\nSAM: Of course.\nTRAVIS: I need your help.\nLAURA: Pike!\nTRAVIS: I would like to move the boulder.\nLAURA: Can I perception around it before we do anything?","response":"DM: Certainly! Go ahead and roll perception."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's in the path?\nLAURA: It's a side path that's been blocked.\nLIAM: 15 for Vax.\nLAURA: Oh, did you see it?! It was there and it went like that! It was a 20 and then it went (squeaky noise) because it was on the side. But that's okay. 20 is what it ended up as.","response":"DM: 20? Okay. Both of you guys take a look. There's nothing immediately dangerous at all. It just looks like this rock was not naturally formed here, of course. It looks like it was wedged in. Like it was actually placed there intentionally."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 26? On the strength check?","response":"DM: On the strength check? So as you guys are explaining, “This seems to be a fairly–” You don't even get to finish your sentence before Grog goes– grabs the boulder, gets underneath and, lifting with the knees, Atlas-style. Puts the weight on the back and (groans)–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! I use my Mage Hand and I push it, too.","response":"DM: You lose your balance over the boulder as it's now shoved off of its axis."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: It falls behind you, slamming into the wall, blocking half the passage, the passage you guys were going down immediately. You can still pass it, you just have to walk around it. And you may have tweaked something in your back a little in the process."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, Grog, how's your back?\nTRAVIS: I roll over on my stomach and I ask Trinket to step on my back.\nLAURA: Oh, Trinket, give him a massage. He's really good at it!\nTRAVIS: I roll over and have Trinket step on my back.","response":"DM: Trinket gets up, pushes on you with the bear claws."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Make biscuits, Trinket. Make biscuits on Grog's back.\nTRAVIS: (groans in relief)","response":"DM: You can hear the cracks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I look down the passageway that was opened up?\nTRAVIS: Thank god.","response":"DM: You can. The passage is very, very thin. It can maybe fit you individually. It can barely fit Grog when you actually go through the passage proper."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's pretty spacious in here, I think.","response":"DM: For a gnome, yes. But yeah, it's pitch black going forward. Which means you guys can see. It's equivalent of low light for you in pitch darkness. About 30 feet ahead of you, you can see the path continues for a little bit and then widens up into what looks like a small chamber. But you'd have to get closer."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it dangerous at all?","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Everywhere is dangerous.\nSAM: How far is the chamber?","response":"DM: About 30, 35 feet back. So?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 21.\nLAURA: 18.","response":"DM: Best you can tell, it just looks like a chamber and it looks like a hallway."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We should investigate.\nMARISHA: It just looks like a death trap.\nTRAVIS: If this is a tomb, I'm going to be so pissed at the two of you.\nLAURA: Tiberius, can you send a little light down that passageway?\nORION: Yeah, sure. You want to shoot an arrow for me, love?\nLAURA: Let's do it.\nLIAM: Vax chases the arrow.\nSAM: You're just going to go down the hall?\nLIAM: Yeah, stealth.\nLIAM: I followed it.","response":"DM: You followed it in?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I rolled a 26 on stealth.","response":"DM: Right. You rush in."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Follow up the arrow.\nSAM: Bear trap!","response":"DM: First thing you understand: the air smells faintly of ancient untouched dust and mildew."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no, what did we just let loose?","response":"DM: You glance at the floor and notice what appear to be six long-dead bodies strewn across the ground."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How long-dead?","response":"DM: Skeletal and covered in webs."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Who's in there? Just Vax right now?","response":"DM: Just now Vax."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to check out the very first, the closest body to the exit.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Nah, it's fine. They're dead.\nLIAM: 19.","response":"DM: 19, okay. As you look across the body, I mean there's nothing formal about this area, there's no fine, chiseled structure. It looks like a natural formation. It just appears to have been the final destination for whoever these individuals were. And you do notice, the way they're adorned, they were an adventuring party. They were people who came down here long ago for whatever reason and the last destination was this small cavernous space."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You said they're covered in webs?","response":"DM: There are webs on them, but the webs themselves are small, natural spider."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Small, natural. So not Bilbo Baggins.","response":"DM: But you do notice that each one of their skulls has a giant hole bored into the bone itself. Different places in the skull."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm just going to start searching all of them.","response":"DM: Anyone else want to do anything?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to make my way, as well.\nORION: I thought we were all following.","response":"DM: The rest of you make your way in one by one. It's a small room."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm staying outside with Trinket and Grog.","response":"DM: Okay, you guys hang out there."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I feel like Pike wouldn't want us to do too much damage to these bodies. I just feel like she wouldn't want us to disturb them.\nLIAM: I don't give a shit about these bodies. I care about what they are carrying.","response":"DM: Okay, looking at it, you notice that they have been here for at least 200 years. Two of the bodies are male humans. There are two dwarven bodies: one male, one's female."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Armor. Look for armor!","response":"DM: One female gnome and one half-orc."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, wait. What?\nORION: Half-orc.\nMARISHA: Half-orc? Okay. Hang on. You listed all that off.\nSAM: I'm going to inspect the gnome.\nLIAM: You're not even in the room.","response":"DM: Okay, so you enter the room. Roll an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 19.","response":"DM: Okay. Looking at her, you find that most of these bodies have already been for the most part turned over and looted. Some of them have no armor. They're either in plain clothes or it looks like their bodies have been tossed and taken whatever was on them, off. You do find, buried in the dirt under the gnomish female what looks to be a pristine ruby. Worth probably quite a bit."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to do an arcana check of 22. Just on the pile of bodies.","response":"DM: Okay, I'll get to you in just a second. You, as you're inspecting the bodies on the other side, you come across the dwarven male is still fully armored."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh!\nORION: Nice.","response":"DM: Actually has a golden chainmail on and is clutching what looks like a metal maul. The rest of them have no armor and no weapons. But this one is still fully adorned. And you also notice that the female dwarven corpse, while devoid of any accoutrements, any coin purses, belts or anything, does have, hidden within the bony clavicle, what little bit of stretched dried skin is pulled against it, a pendant that is gleaming blue."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I grab the pendant, and then I start– this looks good for Pike, so I start taking the chainmail off.","response":"DM: You pull the pendant and you look at it. It has a very beautiful sapphire emblem and you rub the dust off of it and you look at it. And you recognize this emblem. This is the emblem that adorns House Thunderbrand of Kraghammer. You turn it over and on the back, there's an engraving on the back that says: “For Lorna, my love.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Didn't he say to bring back some stuff from the Underdark?\nORION: Yes. This is what we need.\nSAM: Who's he?\nTRAVIS: That name sounds familiar, though.\nLAURA: Oh wait, your magic guy said to bring back some magic stuff from the Underdark.\nSAM: From the Value of Valor. Tremaine? Was that his name?\nORION: And that's what this is. Let me take it and do– I'll use that arcana check on that.","response":"DM: Yeah, the actual amulet itself does have a magical essence to it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I think this will do for our friend back up on the surface. Or under surface.\nSAM: Oh, it's something.\nLAURA: What is it?\nSAM: Amulet of the Shield.\nORION: (mumbling) This protective amulet of the shield … adding plus five to your AC against that attack.\nLAURA: What does it do?\nSAM: It protects you.","response":"DM: It effectively acts as a Shield spell once per day. Once per short rest."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Once per day?","response":"DM: Once per rest."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Nice. It's like a magic shield.","response":"DM: Yeah, it's a reaction."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you have to be able to use magic to use it?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh!\nLAURA: I don't think so. Who has low AC that could use it?\nORION: Well, I'm the only glass cannon.\nLAURA: Oh that's why it's still– Oh no!\nTRAVIS: What was it?\nLAURA: One.\nTRAVIS: One!","response":"DM: Natural one."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We have a natural one\nLAURA: Everything okay in there?\nLIAM: (wheezing) No.\nSAM: Is he dead?","response":"DM: No. You are considered cursed, which means you have disadvantage on all your ability checks and attacks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You're cursed?\nMARISHA: How do we get rid of this?","response":"DM: There are spells like Remove Curse."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I bet Pike has that spell.\nTRAVIS: Remove Curse?\nLAURA: I don't know?","response":"DM: Pike's not here. I don't have her spell list."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I could try it, hold on. Nope.\nLAURA: Nothing?\nMARISHA: What did you touch? What did you grab?\nLIAM: Armor. It was the armor, wasn't it?\nLAURA: It was that golden armor, yeah.\nTRAVIS: Let's leave the golden armor alone.\nLIAM: (strained) I got this for you, Pike.","response":"DM: Wait a second. Ha!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.","response":"DM: So. At which point, Kima steps forward and pushes everyone away for a second and concentrates. And she reaches up and grabs the holy symbol of Bahamut from underneath the front of the leather armor, because she still hasn't exchanged it with you. And it glows with this vibrant silver light and the light travels down her arm, to her hands, to her fingers, and she places it out and reaches towards the armor and as she touches it, she winces slightly, but you see this glowing dark furious anger, this face arise out of the armor, giving off this slight whispering howl sound (whispering howl) and then (poof) dissipate. As you see the divine energy begin to dissipate and glide off her hand, she reaches over and touches you with her hand, and the curse is lifted."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, that was easy.","response":"DM: I looked over and realized that oh, she actually has that spell."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I grasp Kima by the hand and say, “That is one I owe you. That's one I owe you.”","response":"DM: She gives you a wink and says, “To be honest, I just really wanted the armor.” And she pats you on the shoulder."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's yours.","response":"DM: She takes the golden chain off of the body, she (chuckles) she tells– no, you're out of the room."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you need me to create a curtain for you to change behind?\nLAURA: You're not in the room.","response":"DM: She finds a cranny in the room. She puts on the chain mail, replacing the leather armor she gives back."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispers) Damn it. I was trying to get it.\nTALIESIN: Right.\nLIAM: As we leave the cavern, I give one of these to the dwarven bodies.","response":"DM: You swear you hear a slight shift in bone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh!","response":"DM: In silence left behind in darkness."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to take the ruby, too.\nLAURA: Hey, did you get that armor back?\nLIAM: Yeah, I got that armor back.\nLAURA: Hey, can I have that armor? Can I have it?\nLIAM: Sorry, sis.\nLAURA: Please?\nLIAM: Kima has it.\nLAURA: No, she gave it back.\nLIAM: No, she wore it.\nLAURA: No, she gave it back.","response":"DM: She put the chain mail on, she gave you the leather armor back."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Give it, give it.\nLIAM: Oh, that's between you and her. I'm not taking armor off of her.\nLAURA: Please, can I have that armor?","response":"DM: She's holding it in her hands. “Certainly.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: “Thanks.” I go put it on. I don't know what it is. It's magic though.","response":"DM: It's whatever armor you gave her."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wait, my armor?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: That's my armor.","response":"DM: The armor that you gave for her to put on in the Emberhold when she had nothing on."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I gave it to him, he gave it to her. And you're taking it? Hey, hey, hold on a second!\nLIAM: I think we need to roll a brother sister contest die.\nLAURA: No, we should just–\nLIAM: I grab her by the ear and say, “That's mine. That's mine.”\nLAURA: Ow ow! Come on. I need it.\nLIAM: Squeezing her earlobe really hard.\nLAURA: Roll.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, you two roll. Go for it.\nLAURA: Shit. (yelling) Aha! It's mine, it's mine!","response":"DM: Persuasion versus persuasion? Is this what this was?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, sure, sure.\nLAURA: Sure it was.\nTALIESIN: They played arm punch until one caved.\nLIAM: It's not fair.\nLAURA: Yeah, what does it do?\nLIAM: I'm not fucking– Figure it out.","response":"DM: You keep talking over each other."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Are you just having party arguments right now?","response":"DM: Apparently. As you guys head back into the cavern, you move around the boulder that Grog had moved from the side crevice. And as you continue for about another 20 or 30 minutes, some of you begin to pick up what sounds like the distant lapping of waves against a shore."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What.\nTALIESIN: That's never good.","response":"DM: (wave noises) As the tunnel begins to curve larger and larger, eventually you come around a bend and the tunnel opens up into a humongous cavern housing an underground lake circling a large island. From what you can see on the edges of the walls that are closest to you as the island disappears into darkness about a hundred feet ahead of you, there are these blue crystals that you've seen throughout this tunnel completely covering the walls of this entire cavern. There is only maybe bits of and places around the wall, about five, ten feet across where there will be no crystal. Otherwise it's just grey stone and blue crystal jutting from the sides."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I go over to one of the crystal walls and I put my hand on the crystal and I cast Daylight, trying to see if I can emanate it up through the dome.","response":"DM: Okay. You cast Daylight and on the actual crystal source that you cast it on, daylight emanates from it and gives a bright beacon of light."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I want it to light up the crystal. Trying to see how far I can get it to reach up to the top.","response":"DM: Right. You notice that from the whatever crystal vein structure some of these are connected by, some of them tend to glow in spots, but you see it's localized. All this crystal isn't interconnected, is what this tells you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: There are pockets here and there that are interconnected, but there are multiple veins of it going through the entire."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What kind of liquid is this lake made of?","response":"DM: So, as you approach, the hard stone surface you guys have been walking on in the tunnel begins to give way to like a coarse sand, almost like a gravelly shore. And it appears to be fresh water. It's clear. The smell is a little musty, but not too bad. And you approach, and you can see there's just these very gentle, very soft waves that occasionally lap up on the shore, but only a few inches. There's not a whole lot of motion to the water within this cavern."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Can we see to the bottom? Is it that clear?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I've got an idea. I'm going to find a small rock– Oh, go ahead.","response":"DM: I'll finish my description. (chuckles) So there's this lake circling this large island across the way. You also see on this side of the shore, central, there is a large stone bridge that arches over the lake and makes landfall about roughly 200 feet on the other side, at the very, very tip closest to you of this island. It's about 15 feet wide this bridge, maybe 20 feet, and is an immediate walkway onto this island across. You can see just faintly on the edge of this island a glowing bioluminescent fungal forest that covers a large portion of this island's top side. The edges of it, you can see, rise up into cliffs that have eroded over time and are rather stark in places."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Plants! Look, living things!\nTALIESIN: Clarota? Is this in any way dangerous?","response":"DM: Clarota, as you look over, is gliding into the cavern. It's the closest thing you can imagine seeing a mind flayer to smiling. He's looking about and in response to you, a few moments later, he says, “We're near home.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's all remember his feet don't actually touch the ground.\nTRAVIS: Right. Do you know if there's anything in the water?","response":"DM: He glances over to you. “There are many things in the water. Fish. Crustaceans.” He points over, and you can see there is this small, very pale, colorless, whitish-gray crab that's over to the side, that looks weird, malformed. One claw is twisted on itself and dragging behind it. And it skitters off into the water. Everyone make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yay.\nSAM: No!\nLAURA: Oh, natural 20!","response":"DM: Oh snap."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 14.\nMARISHA: 20.\nTALIESIN: Eight.\nTRAVIS: Six.\nLIAM: One.","response":"DM: Oh, you two. As you all walk up to the edge of the shore line and you're inspecting the water, feeling for it. You look over and on the far left side of the shore, you can see just below the waterline what looks like… a sunken boat. Or two."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I can't see shit.\nLAURA: What? There's a sunken boat in the lake.\nTRAVIS: Really, should I go get it?\nLAURA: Down here? Clarota, why? Why boats?","response":"DM: Clarota gives you a look. “I do not know. Many things wander these tunnels beyond my kin. We are but one of its denizens.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Who's a good swimmer?\nTRAVIS: Me! I'm actually a really good swimmer.\nMARISHA: Me.\nLIAM: Lady Keyleth.\nTALIESIN: She's a very good swimmer.\nLAURA: You guys want to take a look?\nMARISHA: I run over to the edge of the water and I do a swan dive and as I swan dive, I turn into a shark in the water.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I run to the water, as well, and I fucking cannonball.","response":"DM: So Keyleth's form jumps into the air, this thin, lithe half elven figure that then turns into this giant shark beast that (splash sound) into the water underneath. A few moments later, Grog jumps in. Big splashing sound."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to follow and I'll stay behind enough to where I can cast? Do I have to get in the water also?","response":"DM: You can. You still can't quite see what everyone's going for, other than what she said."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, I'll get a little– I won't jump in quite yet, but I'll get to the edge.\nTRAVIS: One and a half inches? Me, too.\nORION: That's a medical condition for a goliath.","response":"DM: There aren't usually this many penis jokes in a session, folks. It just happens to be one of those days. So, glancing down below, you see it too. There are approximately two and a half boats that are made of some sort of a combination of wood and metal, like a heavily rusted iron. One of them looks mildly serviceable, the other one is broken with a large hole in the bottom of it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I do a lap.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Go check it out.","response":"DM: You look around. There doesn't appear to be much else around, but you do catch what looks like a semblance of a half-eaten corpse, a bone that is left partially buried in the ground. You don't know how long that's been there, either. It's bleached bone at this point. Whatever fishes live in this landscape have picked it clean."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So there's nothing in the boats at all?","response":"DM: Nope."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good times.\nMARISHA: Weird.\nSAM: Awesome.\nORION: We could just keep going.\nLAURA: Maybe you come back.\nTRAVIS: Ask him if the bridge is booby-trapped.","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Make a perception check, (mumbles) yep, yep.\nLAURA: Are you still in the water?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I'm shivering.\nMARISHA: 12. As a shark, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Plus three for shark.","response":"DM: Okay. You do a couple laps. Nothing really catches your eye."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (gulps) I take a big breath and swim down to where the giant shark is. Can I also perception check?","response":"DM: You can also attempt a perception."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: This is like one out of every five games that I get to. 12. Plus zero.","response":"DM: You found some boats, yo!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yay.\nTRAVIS: Boats!","response":"DM: They are broken."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I go and I see that Grog's underwater and I Flipper him and go up under him and, “Hold on! Here we go.”","response":"DM: Giant shark comes up under you and nudges you aggressively and lifts you towards the surface."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Dolphin hump him a little bit?\nMARISHA: Well… You've heard of those– never mind. I'm just going to keep going.","response":"DM: You guys all watch as Grog is now riding a shark."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Awesome. Awesome.\nTRAVIS: Should we ask Clarota if the bridge is safe to travel?\nLAURA: Clarota, is that mushroom forest, I mean, is that your home?\nSAM: Should we go there? Should we skip it, Clarota?","response":"DM: “The forest certainly surrounds the city.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I carry Grog over to the island on the other side.","response":"DM: “There are many places of entry within this cavern.” And you see Clarota concentrate for a second, and within all of your minds, you suddenly have a very clear image of this entire cavern: its layout, what strange shape it is, where the general overlook is, and as clear as day, you have an entire visual of the inside of this cavern. You guys reside down here, right by the bridge on this edge of the beach. This green represents the fungus and this, you imagine, represents the city. The temple being central there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should not take the bridge.\nSAM: Yeah, that's a lot of fungus to get through before the city. Are they still down there in the water?","response":"DM: Yes, they are."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's wait until they get back before we decide.","response":"DM: I'll put this down here in case you want people to see that."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Where are we on that map?","response":"DM: You guys are right here."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Grog, can you pull up any of those boats?\nTRAVIS: Pull?\nLIAM: Pull them up, Grog. Pull them up.\nLAURA: I like it.\nMARISHA: I go over and I swim Grog over. And can I, as a shark, give some shark push from the bottom?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, fuck, yes, we have an underwater breathing kit, that we bought at the store. There's two of them.\nMARISHA: Sick!","response":"DM: Potion?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I wrote, “two underwater breathing,” and didn't write what it was.","response":"DM: Two underwater breathing biscuits. Two underwater breathing waffles."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It was totally potions.\nMARISHA: Potions.","response":"DM: I'm pretty sure it was potions. I'm pretty sure they were potions."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What type of boat is this?","response":"DM: You haven't had a good look at it yet."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I tried to look, but I'm a shark, so I don't know shit, really. It's a boat.\nTRAVIS: Okay, so we swim up to the top and we come back to the shore and you're just in the water still. “Yes?”\nSAM: What's down there? Do you need help?\nTRAVIS: It looks like some kind of boat.\nSAM: That's all you got?\nTRAVIS: My perception is shit.\nSAM: Well, should we try again with someone who has better perception?\nLAURA: You want me to go down there?\nTRAVIS: Absolutely.\nLIAM: Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to pull up one of those boats.\nLAURA: Maybe we should check out the boats first.\nMARISHA: You want to jump on my back?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nORION: “Is that all we need to do? Okay, fine.” And I walk over to the thing and I jaunt off into the water.","response":"DM: Tiberius slowly disappears beneath the surface. It is cold!"}
{"prompt":"ORION: “Oh, it's so cold.” I take out one of my bottles right before I go under. My bottle of air.\nSAM: What?\nLAURA: His air bottle.","response":"DM: You see the bubbles break on the surface and then eventually the bubbles stop. Tiberius may have drowned; you don't know."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can see him.\nORION: I swim over there. I use my tail. I think I'm a good swimmer. And I want to swim up to where I can see the boat.","response":"DM: Okay, this doesn't take you too far. It's maybe 60 feet from the edge of the coastline."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, okay. Is it darkened? Can I see the boat now?","response":"DM: You can see, as long as you're traveling with a Light spell going on, which I assume you do at most points."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes. I still have my staff.","response":"DM: But yeah, you see there are two and a half boats, essentially. They're large, looks like they were meant specifically for travel. You're not quite sure where it may have come from."}
{"prompt":"ORION: How large is it?","response":"DM: I'd say it's maybe about 15, almost 20 feet from end to end."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, so I notice it. You're nudging the one that you want, right? Is that's what's going on? So I notice that.\nLIAM: Pull it up.\nMARISHA: I try and push it.\nORION: I (ping) my Ioun Stone, direct Telekinesis to lift up the boat out.","response":"DM: So you're putting your Ioun Stone on?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: He gave the other one to me.","response":"DM: Oh, got you. Okay, so you put on the Ioun Stone."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I cast Telekinesis on the boat to lift it up.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I try to swim underneath it.","response":"DM: Okay. There's a rustle in the waves on the surface of the water, as you see all of a sudden this (impact sound) this bowing and splashing begins to occur. The ship begins to rise out of the sediment on the bottom of the lake."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I try to get it just right on the lip.","response":"DM: It gets up. It's filled with water, you tip it on its side and spill the rest of the water out. There's still a large hole on the bottom of the boat, on the inside. And you carry it over back to the surface of the shore and rest it gently onto the rock."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can you fit that boat in your Wheel of Mending?\nORION: I'm underwater. I'm going to jaunt back up, up to the surface.\nLAURA: Tiberius, welcome to the surface. Can you use your Wheel of Mending on that boat that you just pulled up?\nORION: I put my bottle away. “I don't know. It's a good question. I mean, I don't see why not.”\nSAM: Percy could assist. He's got some engineering.\nTALIESIN: Well, I can't help with the wheel, but I could repair the boat, in theory.\nORION: Percy, why don't you give it a whack before we put a boat on the Mending Wheel.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to make a list of things that I'm going to need. I may have to send them down for more parts of boats from the other boats.\nLAURA: Try the wheel first.","response":"DM: Telekinesis is still in effect currently, so if you wanted to do that, now would be the time."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Bring up the broken boat.\nORION: Oh, yes, here you are.","response":"DM: Okay, so Tiberius comes back with the half boat, essentially, that's cracked in half and part of it is ruined and broken. But there's still a sizeable amount of oxidized iron, metal, and wood here that you think would be serviceable for repairs."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Please don't roll a one. Okay, so I'm going to do a little tinkering to see if I can get this fixed.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Unless you want to try the wheel first?","response":"DM: It's up to you guys. So you're going to go ahead and make a tinkering check?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll do a tinkering check first and then try the wheel.\nORION: Why don't you tinker it first.","response":"DM: Anyone want to help?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What do I use as my modifier?","response":"DM: I would say this is a key point in time for a Scanlan song."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh! Yes, of course.","response":"DM: You use this bardic inspiration specifically for stuff like this."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I do. Yes, I will inspire you. I don't know what to sing. What's a boat song?\nSAM: How does it start?\nTALIESIN: I'm not feeling very inspired.\nTALIESIN: I feel inspired.","response":"DM: I'll give you a d6 for that."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's worth a d10.\nTALIESIN: Okay.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: My dex modifier, thanks. Thank god. 13.","response":"DM: 13 total?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, 13 total.","response":"DM: Okay. You take a while with it. It takes a little bit longer than you anticipated, but you have your general tools with you. You hammer away. About an hour and a half to two hours later, you're sweating, your muscles are sore, but you feel like you've managed to get the hole for the most part patched. Now it's just to test its buoyancy."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You want to try the Mending Wheel?\nORION: My spell doesn't last that long.\nTALIESIN: Let's put it in the water and see what happens.\nTRAVIS: I start pushing the boat back in the water and I jump in and I start jumping up and down.","response":"DM: You push it in. You leap in the boat. It (impact sound) gives to the 600 pounds that are Grog. It splashes a bit, it lifts, it seems to be holding. It's leaving ripples in the water."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Will it fit all of us, you think?\nMARISHA: I'm going to stay a shark and follow in the water.\nSAM: Let's pile in the boat.\nMARISHA: Can I tow them?\nTALIESIN: I was about to say, we can make a harness out of rope.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: We'll be less conspicuous.\nMARISHA: Yeah. Not as much rowing.\nTALIESIN: Shark power is far less conspicuous.\nORION: I saunter on the boat up next to Grog and go, “Excuse me.” As I open the bag of holding and take out the magic carpet (sound of carpet unfurling), and I hop on that.\nLAURA: I get on the magic carpet.\nORION: I'd rather be a free agent on this one. I'm not here to fight on water.\nTALIESIN: I'm setting up a gun mount on the boat, just in case.\nMARISHA: Do you guys want to get out the rope and put it around me?\nTALIESIN: We'll get out the rope and throw a loop for you to grab.\nMARISHA: I swim through the loop.\nLAURA: Trinket, get in the boat.\nSAM: I just want to know which way we're sailing. Are we going left?\nLIAM: Clarota put the image all in our heads.\nTALIESIN: See, there's an island over on that side.\nSAM: This way, or do we want to go this way?\nLIAM: Vox Machina, there is an island, there are also two small caves and–\nLAURA: There's three small caves.\nLIAM: Where?\nLAURA: Well, two small caves and then a path.\nLIAM: Two and then rivers and paths out, yes.\nMARISHA: Do we want to check them all out? Clear out the fog of war.\nLIAM: We could go straight for the big prize.\nORION: Are we all agreeing that, have we all decided to come here or here?\nLAURA: Toward the island, I think.\nMARISHA: I think if we can go here to this little island, I might be able to do some think-y, spy-y scrying stuff before we storm the city.\nLIAM: What do you mean, Keyleth?\nTRAVIS: Loot the cave first, and then the island.\nLAURA: Cave first?\nMARISHA: Cave first.\nTRAVIS: Right, cave first.\nLAURA: And then island. Let's go there.\nLIAM: When we eventually want to take the temple and kill this son of a bitch, we probably want the shortest amount of distance on land as possible, which means coming in from the north end where Tiberius is pointing.\nORION: Coming in through here, which is the least resistance.\nLIAM: Yes. I agree.\nORION: Directly to the temple.\nLIAM: But I think we're all a little slap happy and curious.\nLAURA: That might be cliffs on the back end, though, you guys. We won't be able to scale those.","response":"DM: Best you can tell, from the image that was given to you, any of those sections along the edge that have the jagged lines are cliffs."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But the north-western edge has a beach?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But, we're curious about the island?\nSAM: Let's just set sail.\nLAURA: Set sail. Towards the island!\nLIAM: So, Vox Machina, are we going to head around the southern, south-eastern edge?\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nLAURA: We're going, we're sailing.\nLIAM: Does anyone know how to steer this thing?\nMARISHA: I'm towing us.\nTALIESIN: We're shark-powered.\nLIAM: Oh, towing.\nLAURA: I'm on the carpet with you.\nORION: Yes!\nLIAM: That is impressive.\nTALIESIN: Aw, yeah.\nLAURA: Should we put Pass Without a Trace on us?\nSAM: She's a shark.\nTALIESIN: We're pretty stealthy.\nMARISHA: I'll hug the far wall, though. I'll hug the wall.","response":"DM: You hug the far edge of the water. Pushing across, you find a way around and as you begin to look up the wall, you can see once again how these crystalline structures are spread out across this entire wall, going up. You can't even see the ceiling of the cavern, it's so high up from your current perspective. It just disappears into darkness. You continue following the path until eventually you come to this choke point here, where the land mass begins to– you can see where the beach begins to crest down and touch the water. As you slowly and quietly make your way around the bend, you look over and you can see the forest. Indeed, they appear to be trees, but now that you have a better view of it, you know, maybe about 400, 500 feet off from you right now, that bioluminescent glow, this very faint glow is given off by all the plant life, all these giant fungal trees. The roots have these strange, organic, almost like they're gripping the ground. The canopies of them blossom in these strange, almost mushroom-like appendages, these fungal bursts that stick off the top and form the tree-like canopy. And you can see vines hanging from each of these. It's a very strange, alien forest. Fauna that even you're not familiar with in your travels. But it does give off this dull color, this faint light source that does tend to give a general visual view of the landscape on this island. You do see, just barely beyond this point, looking across, the tops of a few buildings in the very, very distance. The color of the stone, from what you can make out, has almost a jade mixed with a grey marble. And you can just faintly make off in the distance one large pyramid-like structure that comes to a flattened precipice on top."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is on the island?","response":"DM: On the island, to your left. And there is a very, very faint greenish glow at the very top that matches the coloration of that same glow you saw in the eyes of Queen Ulara earlier and the rest of the denizens that were in her party. As you quietly begin to push along, you come to the point where there's the beach to your right and there's the island to the left. The island, which comes to this incline and then drops off on a cliff on the far side. It has its own encapsulated fungal forest. You can see what looks like a very, very faint bit of ruins on the eachfront that has mostly crumbled and fallen. But for the most part it appears to be fairly empty, other than the fungal growth itself. To the right there is another pebble beach, same consistency as the beach you first arrived on."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What's the scale. Are we talking Manhattan and Brooklyn? Or smaller than that?","response":"DM: To put to scale, your boat that you found is about that big."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, okay. So it's pretty big, then.","response":"DM: It's pretty big."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Should we land on the beach and then check out that little cave?\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: Yes, I think that's an excellent idea.\nLIAM: We're all very curious.\nSAM: I'm not curious.\nLAURA: As we're flying overhead, can I get a better look at if there's anything on the beach?","response":"DM: Yeah, as you guys come gliding down, you look at the beach. You see the ruins, you see, even though there is no real breeze or wind in this cold air, there is like a slight swaying."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: On the beach?","response":"DM: To the trees that reside on this."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What about the little island– the little cave.","response":"DM: On here?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Best you can see, looking down, it's just a plain, pebble beach, an inlet there that goes into the cavern interior of the wall."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Let's get all up in that bad boy.\nSAM: Go in the cave?\nTRAVIS: There's treasure.\nLAURA: Treasure! Pirates! Arr!\nSAM: I already have a ruby. I'm fine.\nMARISHA: I'll stay with the boat. As a shark.\nLAURA: Do we fly in, Tiberius? And just go…\nORION: Absolutely.","response":"DM: You can certainly try to keep quiet while doing so. The cave that actually opens up in the side of the wall within this cavern is about 20 feet up and about 25 feet across. So you're flying as low as you can, but you're still only about maybe 15 feet off the ground. Ten to 15 feet. Are the rest of you going in?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, we're in the boat. But Grog and I want to go. Right?\nTRAVIS: Nope.\nLIAM: No?\nSAM: I'll come.\nTRAVIS: I'm thinking it'll be a quick trip.\nLIAM: Is the boat coming up to the beach?\nTRAVIS: Yep.\nTALIESIN: I'll wait here.\nMARISHA: Ooh! Pretty flashy.\nSAM: Natural 20.\nTRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.\nORION: 13.\nTALIESIN: I'm in the boat.","response":"DM: In the boat?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 13.\nTRAVIS: Six.\nLIAM: 27.\nORION: Oh, we are on the carpet.","response":"DM: As you guys not-so-stealthily begin to march into the tunnel here, you follow it as it bends around a little bit and it eventually opens up into this larger space. And as you enter the room, partway through this tunnel, the scent changes dramatically. That cold, still water smell begins to give way to this terrible, sulfurous, rotting smell. Very– it's near septic. And as you enter this room, the smell is dreadful, and you can tell, using your light source over here, there appears to have been some sort of a struggle. There are bedrolls and sheets strewn about and soiled and burned and torn across the floor. There's about what looks like three or four different bedspreads that have been tossed and ruined. You can see a semblance of what was a fire pit, but all the soot and ash has been smeared across the ground to the outside of it. There appears to be a half buried chest or container off in the far corner. And you can see what looks to be four dead bodies, in a not too long state of decay. You can still see flesh and skin, but there's some bone peeking through, and they're all slumped against the ground, against the corners."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Vax, why don't you go mess with them?\nLIAM: I'm going to use perception on the chest and the bodies.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is not that good. That is 13.\nORION: I'm going to use my earring of whisper right now. “There's some fun things in here. Grog, you're not wearing it. Someone tell Grog he might need to kill something.”\nLAURA: This looks a little dangerous.\nTRAVIS: We're killing something?\nLAURA: Be ready to run.\nTRAVIS: I come running in.\nLIAM: I'm back from the chest. I take out one dagger and throw it at the chest to sink it into the lid. From a ways back.","response":"DM: You take the dagger and (sound of dagger embedding into wood) into the wood. Doesn't seem to have any immediate effect."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so I did a 13 perception check, I guess on the chest, so I'll go to try and open it.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god.\nTRAVIS: Has anybody run to the back of the cave yet?\nSAM: Are we all in the cave?\nLAURA: We're on the carpet.\nLIAM: You're on my back, Scanlan.","response":"DM: Grog and Percy are still in the boat, at this point."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: But we're listening in.\nMARISHA: Grog's running in.\nTRAVIS: I come running in.","response":"DM: Well, you're in the process of stepping out of the boat at this point. As you begin to approach the chest, you notice one of the bodies shift. (moans) Its head rolls around and it looks at you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Pike?","response":"DM: Pike is still back in the boat with Percy. “What?” She doesn't have one of the earpieces."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Someone call Pike?\nLAURA: Percy, undead!\nORION: Where are the bodies located?","response":"DM: We will get to that at the top of our next session."}
{"prompt":"(all groan)\nLAURA: Oh no!\nLIAM: Oh, nuts!\nTRAVIS: No killing.\nLAURA: We're pirates! (growls)\nMARISHA: I'm a shark, still.","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come back, Ashley!\nLAURA: Help us, Ashley!\nTALIESIN: Grog, you could throw a shark at something.\nMARISHA: Can you?\nTALIESIN: You can toss a shark at a zombie.\nLIAM: You could use the shark like a baseball bat.\nTALIESIN: You could battering-ram a zombie with the shark and just go.\nORION: Sharks don't die as soon as they get out of the water. You can last a couple minutes out of the water if you're a fish.\nTALIESIN: They have sandpaper skin.\nLIAM: It's the undead!","response":"DM: Indeed, the overlord has come!"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Hey, guys!\nORION: What's up, Zac?\nORION: And good entertainment, good entertainment.\nZAC: Great entertainment.\nLIAM: We all know this is going to grow, so we're just getting ahead of the game.\nORION: Much like Scanlan's penis.\nLAURA: Enough with the dick jokes.","response":"DM: About that."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: So, do you guys want to read all these messages?","response":"DM: Yes, I'd love to!"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: So, we had quite a few donations tonight.\nLIAM: Yes!\nLAURA: We did?\nZAC: We did.\nMARISHA: Yes and, we broke PayPal.","response":"DM: I can charge through these real fast."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: I might let you, yeah. Phew!\nMARISHA: Save Grog!","response":"DM: Oh, MauhiduL, who I met on the Minecraft server the other day, which was amazing! If you guys haven't been on the Geek & Sundry Minecraft server. They've actually recreated physically, sequences from our campaign, like battlegrounds, and it's like walking through–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's like a walkthrough! Yeah, actually, if you want a good, creative summary thus far, you can walk through this.","response":"DM: I got emotional walking through it"}

They were texting all of us the pictures.\nZAC: The sculpture of myself makes me pretty emotional, too.","response":"DM: Yeah, that's awesome!

{"prompt":"LAURA: And then get a cyborg brain, because that's what he has.\nLAURA: He's a beast.","response":"DM: TheWroth. “Family favorites: Kid, Grog. Dad, Tiberius. Mom, Vax– no, wait, Scanlan. Thank you for sharing your talents with us.” Aw, thank you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The kid is very smart.","response":"DM: LifeIsRosie."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: RealLifeRosie.","response":"DM: There we go. I read for a living. “I cannot express how watching the shenanigans of you lot of lovable miscreants brightens my worst days. I'm so happy to contribute to both the further adventures of Vox Machina and 826LA, for future lovable miscreants and their own adventures. Less than three.” Thank you. They're so sweet. CheeseBug88. “Ale! And whiskey. Smiley face.” Gayaka. “Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful adventure with us and re-inspiring my love of RPG storytelling.” Aw. Thank you. Striker67. Yeah, Striker. Police brutality, coming up. “So I just want to say thank you for everything you're doing. For gamers everywhere. Loving my first edition Critical Role t-shirt and will be getting the new one, too.” Aw. “Keep sharing your adventures with all of us. Thank you, Vox Machina.” Thank you, Striker."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just wanted to say we have more. We've had new ones come in. New ones.","response":"DM: WeeklyFactoids. “Also, hopefully I can make Travis a great axe and Sam a sword after I finish Liam and Laura's gifts, if you would like.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Wait, what?\nSAM: Say that again?\nZAC: By the way, there's something really, really cool on its way here for you. Like, really cool.","response":"DM: What did you do? What did you guys do? They want to make your axe and your sword now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Travis has been looking online. He wants his own axe.\nTRAVIS: I found one.\nTALIESIN: He was handling a couple at Renfaire. It was kind of scary.\nTRAVIS: Handling or courting?","response":"DM: There is a definitive difference. Ah. Murkro2, thank you so much. Kargoth912, “Thanks for satisfying my D&D addiction while my DM is on vacation. You all rock.” We aim to please. Jean2343, “Thanks for the great show. It takes me back to my old gaming group.” Aw. Thank you so much, Jean. We have 82517. “Watching you guys play D&D is amazing and has inspired me to get back into playing Warhammer 40k with my friends.” Awesome. “Thank you for that, because I'd forgotten how much fun I had doing that.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: You should check out Warmachine.\nMARISHA: Agreed.","response":"DM: Their Iron Kingdoms RPG is really good, too. All good stuff. Norrisseria. There we go.

TheCrazyNixie. “Love the CritRole team, oh and pets Keyleth the shark.”  Genevels, “Great job Critical Role tonight, thanks for bringing back the t-shirts for round two. You guys have encouraged me to start my own D&D group.” Awesome! “I now #encourageboatriding”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We want all of you guys to go find these books, find other people in your town or online, and play.","response":"DM: And send pictures of your group to us. We'd love to see you guys play; it's great."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Tag us, tag Wizards of the Coast, say what's up.\nMARISHA: Yes, tell Wizards of the Coast. Tell them we sent you.\nZAC: Yes, tag Wizards of the Coast, please.\nMARISHA: Wait, how many?","response":"DM: 300. “Keep staying awesome, people.” That's great! That's such good news."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: I want 500 by tomorrow morning. That's all I'm saying.\nMARISHA: I think we can do it.\nSAM: The night is young.","response":"DM: We can do it."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: The night is young. We're going to do a rebroadcast.\nLIAM: What was our goal for subscribers for the night, too?\nZAC: Lucas, what was the final number on subs?\nLUCAS: 2,730.\nORION: Nice!\nZAC: We're 20 away from another TableTop giveaway, which we'll probably hit tomorrow.\nLIAM: And they're staying around for our questions.\nLAURA: No, we're not doing that tonight.\nZAC: It's next week. If we get 1,000 by next week, we'll do a Q&A.\nLAURA: Okay, 1,000 shirts sold.\nZAC: Are you saying you want to dance, is that what you're–\nLIAM: No. No.\nZAC: Just kidding.","response":"DM: We can do a pretty late Q&A too. We'll figure it out. Make it worth everyone's while, too."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Thank you guys for watching tonight for our Thursday programming. We're going to run a rebroadcast.\nLAURA: Matt will do a sexy dance if we sell 1,000 shirts.\nZAC: Lucas, just for Travis, do you mind playing that Overlord song to usher us out of the night? This is for you, Travis.\nLUCAS: I can't find it. One second.\nZAC: Oh, he's got to find it.\nMARISHA: I can't find our Overlord song.\nTRAVIS: What is this?","response":"DM: Oh, and also, for all you guys in the Philadelphia area."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, yes.","response":"DM: Me and Marisha, our fair Keyleth, are going to be at Wizard World Philly this weekend, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday."}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Or if you're at LAX at 1:15, you can meet them.","response":"DM: Also possible! But guys, seriously, thank you all so very very much. You're all amazing. Hope you enjoyed it. Next time we'll kick off with a pretty intense goal, looks like."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I would like to say, everybody who tweets at us and all that stuff, we love it and appreciate it. It makes me smile everyday too, so thank you guys.\nLAURA: Thank you for all your support.\nMARISHA: It's good. I love you guys.","response":"DM: Do we have the song?"}
{"prompt":"(Overlord song plays.)\nSAM: What is that?\nLIAM: Song for Grog.\nZAC: No, it's a song for me.\nMARISHA: They made this for you?\nLAURA: Did you erase the Overlord drawing?","response":"DM: Someone made a song?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: This is metal.\nMARISHA: They made you a song.\nLIAM: We would like to rage.","response":"DM: Oh, look at the chatroom, overlord spam. That's so great."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Amazing.\nLIAM: It's like the Hulk is attacking the chat.\nTRAVIS: Overlord overlord.","response":"DM: That's great. It's on infinite repeat."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's amazing.","response":"DM: Whoever made that, well done."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: That's Alex. He's our sound dude.","response":"DM: That's great."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: He did all the sound effects on your intro video.","response":"DM: Oh, eagle cries. Absolutely necessary, well done. Guys, thanks again, we'll see you again next week, most definitely. All the love."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sorry.\nSAM: Disadvantage.\nASHLEY: Oh, just jumping right in?\nLAURA: Just right into it.","response":"DM: Right in. We have a good number of the party that is still out in the boat that is being towed by Keyleth, currently in shark form."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: We're in a boat?\nTALIESIN: We're in a boat.\nASHLEY: I'm in a boat. I'm in a motherfucking boat.","response":"DM: There's Keyleth's shark form."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where? Awesome.","response":"DM: Right there. So in the cavern, I believe we had Vax, we had Scanlan. Tiberius and Vex on the flying carpet and are making their way down. You scouted ahead and began to check the interior before this happened. So, these creatures are now rising up off the ground, looking insidious in their expression, all glaring at you, as you're the most apparently-nearby individual. What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You have fuzz in your hair.","response":"DM: And it's going to stay!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No you got it. It's gone.","response":"DM: Aw, damn it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Shit.\nLAURA: God.\nSAM: First roll of the night. Yeah!\nTRAVIS: Fuck yes.\nTALIESIN: Bam.\nMARISHA: New dice. Not bad.\nSAM: (wordless squeal)\nTALIESIN: 25.","response":"DM: Ooh! Percy with the rolls. Okay, so 25–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS AND LAURA: 20.\nORION: 16.","response":"DM: 16 for Tiberius. 15 to ten?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: A really strong 13.","response":"DM: A really strong 13 for Vax."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 12. For the shark.\nSAM: Me and Pike. Worst rollers in the game.\nSAM: Well, we roll well when it counts.\nASHLEY: Yeah, but for initiative, we always roll less.","response":"DM: Well, that's the plate armor and– I don't know why. And what have you guys got, initiative-wise?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Four.\nASHLEY: Oh, wow. I got seven.\nTALIESIN: (garbled) No.\nTALIESIN: (garbled) These cookies are really good!","response":"DM: I know. Timing is everything. What are you doing? Quick!"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to tug on the rope three times in succession to let our shark friend know that it's time to boogie. I'm going to take the rope. I'm going to jump out of the boat. Is there anything to tie the rope to?","response":"DM: This beach is just gravel. There's no particular physical element. Maybe on the far end, there might be a part of the wall, but it's going to be an awkward hinge, and there's really nowhere to latch–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is there something that if I had an adhesive that I could–","response":"DM: Well, if you have an adhesive, you might be able to stick it to the wall at the far end of the beach– the cavern wall that you're up against– but there's nothing actually on the beach floor at all."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to attempt to take the piece of rope, place it against the wall, and take an ice shot slightly above the rope and freeze it to the wall.","response":"DM: Okay. So as you hold it up, you line up your enchanted ice chamber of your Pepperbox, fire, and with an extremely loud echoing (gun noise) gun shot sound throughout the cavern, you see a blast. The bullet itself ricochets and spins off into the distance, into the darkness, but you do see left behind, where part of the rock has chiseled from the impact, ice has coalesced and cracked and has, for the time being, held the rope to the edge of the cavern."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm running in, for the rest of my movement.\nTRAVIS: Would you like to go?\nLAURA: Well, you're outside. You can go.\nTRAVIS: Is the boat beached on the shore yet?","response":"DM: No, the boat is not beached. The rope that the boat is attached to is currently attached to the wall, so it's anchored."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay, good.\nASHLEY: And I'm in the boat?","response":"DM: You're in the boat. Grog's in the boat. Clarota, Kima…"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would like to bust out at a full dead sprint after Percy. “There's no blood being had without me!”","response":"DM: As Grog leaps out, (sploosh) splashing. It's shallow at this point. You're about waist deep in the water. You trudge up to the shore, run across the gravel beach, and start heading straight into the cavern after Percy."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Screaming.\nLAURA: Which one looks biggest?","response":"DM: You're still on top of the flying carpet, the three of you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does one of the ghouls look scarier than the others?","response":"DM: Best you can tell, there are three that all look similar in stature. There's one over here that is generally larger, taller, more lanky, and appears to have a semblance of armor on him still. And he almost seems to be giving looks and silent commands to the others."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's a master zombie. Hunter's Mark him.","response":"DM: What's the range on Hunter's Mark? You're back here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Hey, Laura!\nLAURA: I did it! Hunter's Mark, 90 feet.","response":"DM: Yeah, you can get there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, good. Well, I don't need it because I'm going to Conjure Barrage a cone at them all once he's Hunter's Marked.\nSAM: Barrage a cone? Sounds like an Italian porn guy.","response":"DM: Hunter's Mark on that one."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: While I whistle for Trinket to get his butt in.","response":"DM: Trinket's ears perk up from the distance. He can hear your whistle echoing through the cavern on the beach side. He stumbles out of the boat, (sploosh) big splash, and chases after Grog."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, and then I Conjure Barrage.","response":"DM: All wet and soaked, the fur pushed against the body. Conjure Barrage. What's the range of that?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's a 60-foot cone.","response":"DM: You are quite a distance from most of them. You might have to hop off the flying carpet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I will?!\nORION: She can move it just fine. Just think, “forward.”\nLAURA: Can we fly the carpet forward?","response":"DM: You're currently not in control of the carpet. Tiberius is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I delay until– what's your initiative?\nORION: Well, 16, but that's fine.\nLAURA: I'll delay until his. Can I do that?\nLIAM: Age ain't slowing them down nothing! Wow. Hi, fellas!","response":"DM: They all leap up. You see portions of their jaw dangling, with these sharp, awful blackened teeth that are broken and gnarled."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I feel so popular!","response":"DM: You glance around suddenly as this darkened room, which you're able to make a little bit of light from Tiberius's light on the end of his staff. They move (whoosh) with a blur of speed, and they're right up in your face."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 28 Days Later zombies.\nLAURA: Oh, god. Get out of the middle of them.","response":"DM: First thing you notice: one of them is giving off an awful stench. The smell you smelled when you first entered the cavern is now so strong that it's nearly overpowering."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is there one specifically?","response":"DM: It's hard to find a source to it. However, you are taking a claw strike from each of them."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, good.","response":"DM: That is going to be a six. That misses."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Hits. 18?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: And then 20."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hell yeah.\nLIAM: Okay. (grunts)","response":"DM: As all these horribly-muddied and half-rotted claws start sinking past the armor into your flesh, the back of your neck. One catches you in the side. And it all happens so fast, you feel like you're almost spun around by the sheer force of the impact. I need you to make three constitution saving throws."}
{"prompt":"SAM: They've got poison or something. They've got poison magic.\nLIAM: Okay. 15.\nLAURA: Okay. Plus your constitution.\nLIAM: Plus nothing.\nLAURA: Oh really?!\nLIAM: It's all in speed, man. 15.","response":"DM: 15."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Six.\nLIAM: 19.","response":"DM: Okay. So, two of the impacts, you feel this sense of strange rot impeding upon your system, and you shrug it off, but one of them still manages to sift through, and your system seizes. You feel all the muscles in your body begin to tighten up, and suddenly you are unable to move. Your entire body is one tense, giant, flexing muscle, and you're unable to shift anywhere from your position."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (strained) Feels like rigor mortis.","response":"DM: You're currently paralyzed, my friend."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no, I can't do anything. You won't be able to dodge it.\nLAURA AND SAM: No!\nTRAVIS: That would be bad.\nORION: How far away am I right now?","response":"DM: Right here? I'd say you're approximately–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, I'll move the carpet the minimum distance I have to for her to get in range.","response":"DM: You can probably push it 20 feet. It's about there."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, so that's where I'll stay. “This doesn't look good.” I cast Obelisk of Stone on my dear friend. (fshh) I'm going to raise him up out of harm's way.\nORION: No, I only raise it about 20 feet.\nORION: And then I go, “That was a good idea!” And then I spend three sorcerer points and I hock a fireball (fwoosh) at all those fuckers, too.\nORION: Yes. Two, four, six. Is it six or eight?","response":"DM: They all failed their saving throw. It's 8d6."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 8d6?! Jeez. Seems unfair.","response":"DM: Same damage your Lightning Bolt does."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, you're right. Man, I'm a bad mama jama.\nORION: 32 damage.","response":"DM: 32 damage. So. As you guys are running into the cavern, you hear this loud, familiar explosion sound that has this weird dull thud. And then flaming heat. You see flickers of light from around the bend, and this wave of heat hits you. The explosion, as it finishes, you can see these three undead are completely incinerated and are left as burning cinders on the ground. This one's still standing. However, the force of the explosion also destroys the pillar from underneath."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh!\nORION: Oh, shit.","response":"DM: Causing him to fall."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hold on, as he falls– do I still have a movement after this?","response":"DM: You used your movement to move the carpet, sorry."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's like the Tower of Terror.\nLIAM: How much bludgeoning damage am I taking?","response":"DM: You only take, I'd say, 2d6."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: No, 1d6, because it's only a 20-foot fall."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right, okay.\nORION: It certainly does. “Vex, would you finish that bastard off?”","response":"DM: Wait, you did land in a bunch of rocks of the broken pillar. Roll another d6 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That was more substantial.","response":"DM: If it was the sand, it wasn't so hard, but it was the fact that I realized there was a whole crapton of pillar rubble that your paralyzed body fell upon, unable to brace your fall. So. That's going to hurt in the morning. Vex, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Well, there's “no” really anybody else, so I'm going to…\nTRAVIS: (teasing) There's “no” really?\nLAURA: There's “no” really anybody else– I can shoot through my fire thing, right?","response":"DM: If you want to, yeah. You still haven't used it for the day."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should I save it?\nLAURA: I'll attack him twice.","response":"DM: Okay, you're attacking him twice. As you're sitting on the carpet, you pull out (schwoop, schwoop) and rapidly release two arrows in succession."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, natural 20!\nLAURA: 21.","response":"DM: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hit him. Oh, actually, 23. I forgot I had bracers on.","response":"DM: That hits. Well, the bracers only affect your damage, not to hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good to know! 21!","response":"DM: You get plus two to all damage rolls with ranged attacks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What do I do for a critical, then?","response":"DM: You roll the regular damage, multiply it by two, and then add your modifier at the end."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Oh, that's not that good. 15 for the first one. And 12 for the second one.","response":"DM: And Hunter's Mark on both of those?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And Hunter's Mark on both!\nLAURA: That was definitely a six. That was a six!","response":"DM: There you go!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Seven, then, for Hunter's Mark.","response":"DM: The smoke filters out of the way, and you make the visual. You see your brother on the ground, currently seizing, and in the rubble, you see the shadow of one of the undead, still standing angrily. It rears back with its claws forward and gives this horrible gnashing sound as its jaw opens and actually widens. This long tongue (wet sucking noise) whips out on it. As you bear down and release one arrow, (shoomf) piercing the side of its shoulder. As it reaches out to break it off, its tongue still out, the second one goes into the tongue, out the back of the throat. (choking noise) It reaches up and breaks off the arrow in the throat, looks towards you, goes to lunge, and as it does, you can see it just collapses on top of his body, no longer moving."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Embrace him. Embrace him!\nLIAM: Give me some sugar.\nLAURA: Can we land? Tiberius?\nORION: I'm sorry. Yes.\nTRAVIS: Tell me it's not over.\nSAM: Oh. Sorry, Grog. The fight's over.\nORION: Sorry, Grog.\nTRAVIS: I live for one thing.\nASHLEY: Am I close enough to get out of the boat?","response":"DM: Yeah, you can get out of the boat."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are you alive?\nLIAM: I'm alive.","response":"DM: Keyleth, you're left out there as a shark as everyone goes inside."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I go look at the treasure chest.\nSAM: I'm going, too!\nLIAM: Good job, badasses.\nMARISHA: I'll stay with the boat.\nASHLEY: I didn't even need to get out of the boat. You guys just handled it like that.\nTALIESIN: I'll go back to the boat, then. It's fine. I don't care.\nORION: I'm sorry, Percy. Listen, I'm sorry, everybody. I didn't mean to kill everybody so quickly. I'll let you kill everybody next time, Percy.","response":"DM: Vex, you go over and lift the top of the chest, which was unlocked previously by your brother. As you lift it up, for a split second you see what looks like a flash of orange energy– a very familiar one, as suddenly, a secondary fire blast (explosion sound) emanates from the treasure chest itself."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I thought you checked for traps.\nLIAM: I didn't do nothing!","response":"DM: The blast radius sends the top half of the chest careening off and scraping off the roof of the cavern. You guys, who just turned the corner, see this giant explosion, sending you about 20 feet backwards."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Awesome. Good thing you didn't get there in time, Scanlan.\nLIAM: Is that chest ten feet away from me, as well?","response":"DM: Yeah. So a reflex saving throw for both of you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, cool.\nLIAM: I have a thing I can do, too.\nLAURA: What's reflex? Is that dexterity?","response":"DM: Or dexterity, sorry. (sing-song) Carry over from Pathfinder. I meant dexterity."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 30.","response":"DM: 30? Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is a dexterity check?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20.","response":"DM: You both manage to find a way to dodge most of the impact, but you still both take 14 points of fire damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: As a rogue with evasion, if I succeed, it's nothing.","response":"DM: Then you take nothing."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: As a twin of a rogue…","response":"DM: You take 14 points of fire damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I have your thingy?\nLIAM: My thingy?\nLAURA: Your eraser thingy?\nLIAM: I don't know where it is.\nLAURA: Oh, thanks.\nASHLEY: You're welcome.","response":"DM: The familiar whine of the trap catches your ear. You dodge out of the way instinctively. Your sister's not so lucky. You take the brunt of the damage, but not the full damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no. Did I destroy the loot?","response":"DM: If you want to inspect what the chest once was. As you go back to where the chest was, most of the chest is destroyed. It's knocked off its hinge. What you do find inside, though, is what looks like a very, very… There we go. What looks like a slightly-charred two-handed blade: a giant sword that is currently laid inside. Looks like it's been there a while in storage. There was a set of natural armor that's been completely destroyed by the blast."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Aw, come on!","response":"DM: There are a number of coins in there. There's probably a good, hefty pile of gold, slightly molded by the moisture that's been kept inside this chest until it was detonated. Gathering it up, you find approximately 420 gold pieces."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah, 420.\nLIAM: What's that mean? Is that a reference? What is that?","response":"DM: But for everything that was damaged inside the chest, the sword, which would be considered a greatsword, seems to be largely unaffected by the blast, other than a little bit of soot that you had to rub off the blade."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'll take it to Grog, because I figure he'll probably be able to use it.","response":"DM: There you go. She hands you this fantastic sword."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't know if it's magic or anything, Grog, so you might want to have Tiberius have a look at it.\nTRAVIS: “Hold on, let me check.” I take it and I shake it really hard.\nORION: That's not how you really–\nORION: As he's doing that, I get 18 trying to see what's up.","response":"DM: Okay, there's definitely a magical aura emanating from the blade. You take a moment to inspect it, and you ascertain the magical nature."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What you have there is a Greatsword of Frenzy, Grog. You have a plus one bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Ooh! When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, after dealing damage, you can immediately make an additional attack for free.\nTRAVIS: Glad I shook it.\nLAURA: Pass that piece of paper over here.\nSAM: Maybe Scanlan could use it.","response":"DM: Scanlan could. It's a little big for you. You'd be at quite a disadvantage using this weapon."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Give it over here. A Greatsword of Frenzy?\nSAM: I'd like to rage frenzy. Are there any bodies that we can look at?","response":"DM: You guys were inspecting what remains of three of the undead creatures. They have been turned to ash, pretty much, from the force of the explosion, the arcane nature of the detonation. You find pieces of them. Most of them have been charred and burned away from the bodies, who are already in partially-decomposed form. The larger one that you had Hunter's Marked, though. Upon inspecting it, while most of its armor is destroyed, it does manage to carry a partially-mildewed coin purse. Looking inside, you only find about five or six pieces of gold, but you do find one really, really nice… looks like it's taken a little bit of damage, but it was once a really pretty diamond."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm just going to keep this with the party gold.\nSAM: With the party treasury? Oh, sure.\nLAURA: Plus one diamond to the treasury.\nORION: “Vex, let me see the diamond for just one second.” As he's shaking his sword, I go into the Bag of Holding and take out the Mending Wheel.\nLAURA: Did you turn it back into coal?\nORION: That's not how it works, Vex.","response":"DM: Tiberius, you reach into the Bag of Holding. You pull out the Mending Wheel, which is a magical artifact that you found earlier in the campaign as part of your personal quest. It looks like a large, spoked, roulette wheel when it's laying down, with these strange points that fold out of it. Once you spin the wheel, you place an object in the center of the wheel. It's lifted without gravity and mends itself back to its undamaged form. You place the diamond in the center and spin the wheel. You can see the actual cracks on the surface of it slowly begin to mend. Eventually, the diamond is brought to a solid, undamaged, finely-cut example of a diamond."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Whoa, sparkles!\nORION: There you go.\nASHLEY: It's so pretty!\nSAM: What time of day?","response":"DM: You have no idea."}
{"prompt":"SAM: How long has it been since we rested?","response":"DM: It hasn't been too terribly long. You rested at the camp after taking out Queen Ulara, so I'd say it's probably been about– with the travel to get to this point, probably about six hours since you rested."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Plus, nobody is hurt.\nLAURA: Well, he's hurt.\nTRAVIS: Well, I'm not hurt.\nLAURA: Can I perception check around the cave?","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll perception."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I remind our party of a couple things? Pike, might be a good time to try to heal Vax's foot again. And also, while we have a moment, did we ever discern what is in that yellow vial?\nORION: Oh this thing?\nSAM: Yeah, do we know what this is?\nORION: I'll do an arcana check on the vial, which is not great. “I don't know, it looks icky.”\nSAM: Let me take a look, as well. Ooh, yes. 24.","response":"DM: You take a look at the liquid and it looks enchanted, but the way its mixture is, the colors seem to swirl and shift in a very caustic way. You can see from glancing at the glass vial it's contained in, the interior of the glass looks slightly pock-marked, almost like the viscous fluid within has actually damaged the glass slightly."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It sounds bad. Bad news.","response":"DM: You're unable to really ascertain what the nature of the liquid is, but those are the details you can make out, currently."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I went over to Vax's foot again.\nLAURA: Oh no, come on! Don't!\nSAM: There's a little zombie poo on it.\nLAURA: I'm getting real tired of your shit.\nLIAM: Ever since we were five.\nLAURA: I rolled 22 on perception, by the way.\nORION: Does this cave bottleneck?","response":"DM: It ends here. This is the end of the cave. It curved around and ended in this little portion here. So you had a perception check? What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 22.","response":"DM: 22."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, yes, yes!\nSAM: Oh, snap.\nMARISHA: Secrets.\nTRAVIS: The second whisper.\nSAM: Get down into frame! Lower into frame. Pull them down.\nORION: Pull them down.\nSAM: Ladies and gentlemen, we have a bunch of shirts to sell tonight.\nLAURA: (quietly) I think maybe…\nLIAM: You look weird. What's up?\nLAURA: We should not be hanging out in this room right now. Can I try to get a better look at what I saw?","response":"DM: You see, best you can, and you guys follow her eyeline. You look up, and you see what first looks like it's part of the cavern ceiling. It has this weird texture. It looks almost like the smooth rock that the interior of the cavern comes off as. However, as you see it shift and move, it looks almost like a portion of it is moving and slowly crawling, and it looks like there's a red gleaming eye, and then two, and something drops down from the side, almost like a tail that seems to dangle for a second. At which point, it detaches. (fwoosh) Opens up almost like a giant ray, with a screeching mouth that (screeches) screams at you. It lands down in the center of the room."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I rolled a nine for medicine, just B-T-W.\nLIAM: How's my foot doing these days?","response":"DM: Your foot is still healing, but unfortunately, based on the medicine roll, it is getting better but not enough to complete the process of you getting all your toes back."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I saw that thing out of the corner of my eye and was just distracted.\nORION: You guys want to run?\nSAM: Oh, what is that thing?\nLAURA: It's a big ray of death. I don't know.\nLIAM: It does look like a flying manta ray.","response":"DM: Let's roll some initiative, folks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh!\nASHLEY: Ugh, come on!\nSAM: Get out of this cave.\nLIAM: Cheeky bastard.\nASHLEY: Oh, really? Really? I just rolled a natural 20. Why couldn't I get that for medicine?","response":"DM: That's how it works."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just throwing it out there: still the shark with the boat.\nLAURA: Ugh, double 20s on the table.\nLIAM: Natural 20.\nMARISHA: If you guys want to run, the keys are in the car. The engine's warmed up, ready to go. I've got the key turned on. It's nice and cozy. That's such a good roll, though. That's a good initiative roll.\nTALIESIN: 22.","response":"DM: 22."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 21.\nLIAM: 25.\nTRAVIS: And the shark.\nMARISHA: 20.\nASHLEY: 20.\nTALIESIN: 22.\nTRAVIS: Plus Ash's was natural 20.","response":"DM: And Grog, what was yours again?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 21.","response":"DM: 20 to 15?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 18.","response":"DM: 18 for Tiberius. 15 to ten?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 11.","response":"DM: 11 for Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ten.","response":"DM: Ten."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Sorry, Scanlan.\nMARISHA: We're all over ten, though. That's pretty good, guys. We should be proud of that.\nLAURA: What should we do? Command us.\nLIAM: Command us?\nLAURA: Do you want us to stay?\nLIAM: Run!\nLIAM: We've never done it before!\nLAURA: We've never run!\nTRAVIS: Let's see what happens!\nLIAM: What the hell is it called? My quick action to dash.\nLAURA: Just leaving me?\nLIAM: Yeah!\nLAURA: You're leaving me behind?\nLIAM: Can I grab her by the scruff and run?","response":"DM: If you want to try and move her, you'll basically move both of you. You can do that, but you'll have no other action."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's what I want to do.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Grabbing my sister.","response":"DM: Grab your sister."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Get on the damn carpet, you fools!\nLAURA: (groaning) Can it fit us?","response":"DM: Currently, you guys would be able to get onto the carpet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We jump onto the carpet!\nASHLEY: What if he flies?\nLAURA: He probably does.","response":"DM: What?! Why would a giant winged-thing fly?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait! Can we have an aerial battle over water? Let's do it!","response":"DM: Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm on the boat.","response":"DM: No, you're not on the boat. You guys have come into the cavern after this point, when you gave chase. You guys are in the cavern."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I started heading back to the boat.","response":"DM: Oh, you did? Then yeah, you're still out by the boat."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So I just heard someone yell, “run.” So I'm going to start unhooking the boat. I'm getting the boat ready to go.","response":"DM: You take the butt of your gun and you start bashing against the ice that you set against the wall. It cracks, and eventually you get the rope free from the side of the wall."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And I'm bringing the boat around so that people can get on really quick.","response":"DM: Okay. That brings us to Grog."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would like to rage… and run!\nTRAVIS: Passing as many people as I can!\nTRAVIS: Rage running! (frantic noises)","response":"DM: Okay. So you just bolt out. I say rage run and barbarian speed, you're going to get nearly completely out of the cavern."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: His knees are really high in the air!","response":"DM: Keyleth! Are you staying out in shark form at the boat?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, I guess. I feel Percy unhook, and I start the forward momentum. Pointing that direction?\nASHLEY: Oh wow, I'm up so soon! Okay, I'm going to start running!\nASHLEY: Can I jump on his leg or back?","response":"DM: You can try to."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: My athletics is a one, total.","response":"DM: So that brings you to a ten. Ten is what you needed. So, as you run up, you leap and grab onto Grog's back. Grog, I want you to make a–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wait, no! Hold on. I need to be honest. I rolled an eight. My athletics is a one, so doesn't that make me nine?","response":"DM: That makes you a nine."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Sorry.\nTRAVIS: Look at that honor code!\nLAURA: That was good, because I was going to let it go.","response":"DM: So! As you jump to grab onto the back of Grog's back, you manage to find purchase. Grog instinctually reaches back with an elbow and hits you right in the side of the armor, which knocks you flat on your back. You're currently prone in the sand right there. And Grog just keeps running. You glance over your shoulder for a second, but because you're raging, you don't see her. You just see shadows in the cavern."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (screaming in panic)","response":"DM: So you start moving your hand in the air, freaking out. Holding your axe in one hand and your greatsword in the other, just (panicked screaming)."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Whack! Boom! Oh my god.","response":"DM: The large, ray-like, cloaked creature swoops down towards the top of the–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh, shoot. We've got to get out of here!\nLIAM: It's a good thing we ran!\nLAURA: Oh yeah. Does it even matter?\nLAURA: No, it's just going to attack us.\nLIAM: We just gave up a turn.\nORION: Yeah, that hits.","response":"DM: The bite attack against you is going to be a 23."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes?\nORION: You're ruining my robe! (grunts)\nMARISHA: Oh no.\nLIAM: (squishing noise)","response":"DM: And the creature wraps around you, (squelch) completely envelops you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Him, or me, or both?","response":"DM: Him. It completely surrounds you and wraps you like a blanket. All of a sudden, your vision goes dark. You feel yourself like (muffled yelling). You're unable to really move. You are blind and unable to breathe. The air is not able to get to you at this time."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Shit.\nLIAM: It is poppycock.","response":"DM: So! That's going to end its turn. Tiberius, your turn."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well. (grunts) Fire breath!","response":"DM: Okay!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that's good!\nORION: (roaring) Get off of me!","response":"DM: Because it's attached to your head, it's going to have disadvantage. So I think it's– is it a dexterity saving throw? Its head is right by your mouth. Go ahead and roll damage. I rolled a natural 20 and a six. So because of the disadvantage, it does not make its save."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So, wisdom?\nLIAM: d6 times something, I think.","response":"DM: Yeah. Roll the damage for your fire breath."}
{"prompt":"ORION: How many d6?\nLIAM: Depends on your level.","response":"DM: Depends on your level, as a dragonborn."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! Hang on.","response":"DM: Should be on your sheet."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is it… no…","response":"DM: No, no, it's… Here, I'll… No! It's part of the dragonborn ability. Let me pull it up real fast."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I don't want to roll wrong. I think it's 2d6.\nLIAM: That's for a low level.\nLAURA: You know nothing here.\nTRAVIS: Your powers are worthless.\nSAM: If only there was a way.\nTALIESIN: If there was some book that had all this information available.","response":"DM: It is 3d6 at 6th level."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! Awesome. Cool.\nTALIESIN: Some ancient tome which suddenly answers everything.\nORION: (panting in relief) 21!","response":"DM: 21 points of damage. You all hear a muffled (explosion sound) as bits of flame begin to shoot out from the corners of where it's wrapping around the torso of Tiberius, surrounding his head. The creature's tail flicks around in pain. You hear this muffled (screeching) sound as it keeps, still tight around his head, fighting through the damage and maintaining its hold on him."}
{"prompt":"ORION: If I do something, I'll probably have disadvantage. Right? Correct? Well, I'll just try it again. I'll spend… fuck. Jeez. No!\nLAURA: Don't spend all your sorcerer's points!\nORION: No, I fly around and (ping) hit one of my stones, and I'll spend… five sorcerer points to cast Telekinesis and (blast sound) fling it off me.\nLIAM: It's a contest. It's like an arm wrestle. It's like arm wrestling with dice.\nORION: Oh, yeah! Arcana?","response":"DM: Well, no. For this, I believe it's the roll plus your spell modifier. Should be five. So roll a d20, add five to it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 20.\nORION: (grunts) Good! I use my movement to get the hell out of there! (grunts)\nMARISHA: Trinket, run!\nLAURA: It's not my turn yet! Tell him to go!","response":"DM: Scanlan, are you staying on the carpet? Anything else you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I am staying on the carpet. Wait! Is Pike off the carpet?\nASHLEY: I'm laying in the dirt.","response":"DM: Pike's laying in the dirt right now."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay! I will jump off the carpet, grab her, and say, “Pike. Come with me if you want to live.”\nSAM: And I just hold her really tight, and I sniff her hair, and it smells like strawberries.\nTALIESIN: Got to make it weird, man.\nSAM: And then I Dimension Door us to the boat.\nMARISHA: Aw! That's cute!","response":"DM: As Scanlan grabs you and holds you for a second, for a moment you're confused, and you hear that strange shrieking moan in the distance, and suddenly the darkness gives way to this flash of purple arcane energy, and the two of you (boof) fall a few inches into hard wood, and you feel the boat rock for a second as you're now on the outside in the boat, being tugged by Keyleth the shark."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Scanlan! Thanks!\nSAM: Don't worry! That hard wood is the boat.\nTRAVIS: I have to applaud.","response":"DM: Okay! Vex!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket! Run!","response":"DM: (bear moan) Trinket runs up. Are you staying on the carpet?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I jump off the carpet, climb on Trinket, and we take off!\nORION: I am going!\nSAM: For now.\nTALIESIN: Up, up, up.\nLAURA: Can you go? Oh, you're a shark.","response":"DM: Being towed."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Damn it!\nTALIESIN: We're fine.\nLAURA: Wonder how far this thing can fly.\nTRAVIS: Well, we'll find out real quick.\nTALIESIN: We have lots of ways to hurt it before it gets there. We have arrows and guns. We're fine.","response":"DM: As you guys all get into the boat–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (shushing) This is the craziest thing ever.","response":"DM: As Keyleth begins to pull away, the boat picks up speed into the water, and you hear that moan sound begin to get louder as the creature (swoosh) out of the cavern, giving chase."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I take a shot.\nTALIESIN: You've been waiting to use this!\nSAM: This is a James Bond water chase!\nLIAM: Okay, so I throw a dagger at the McRay there.","response":"DM: Due to its distance, the darkness behind it, and the fact that you are in a boat, you are at a disadvantage on both your attack rolls."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Plus I had a one on the first one.","response":"DM: So you super miss on that one."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, it was a seven plus… 13 on the second.","response":"DM: Okay, so you throw both daggers. (whoosh whoosh) Unfortunately, it's hard to make the form of the creature. It seems to almost– I can't say change its color, but it embraces the shadows around it, and it gets harder and harder to see. And for a moment, you swear you see two more appear at its sides."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh. Mirror images!\nSAM: Oh no.","response":"DM: You fling both daggers, and they vanish into the darkness and return to your side. That ends your turn. Percy, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm at advantage for this shot!","response":"DM: So it cancels out. It's just a regular shot."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Regular shot.\nLIAM: Come on!\nTALIESIN: 13.\nLIAM: Beautiful human.","response":"DM: 13?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: 13 unfortunately misses."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Damn it!","response":"DM: (gun blast sound) The ship actually rocks from the impact of the explosion. For a second there, you all feel like it's going to list and take on water."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are we all on the boat, or are some people still on the carpet?\nORION: No, a bunch of people are on the carpet.","response":"DM: Who's on the carpet still?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We're in the boat.\nLAURA: We didn't all fit in the boat! That's why we didn't all take the boat originally.\nORION: I'm still on the carpet!","response":"DM: Okay. Tiberius is still on the carpet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You're the only one still on the carpet, then.\nTRAVIS: Like I said.\nTALIESIN: By the way, if anyone wants to make us a little six-square carpet, that would be awesome!\nMARISHA: If someone crocheted us a little single-square magic carpet?\nORION: That'd be so fun.\nMARISHA: So we could put it on our little floaty deal.\nTALIESIN: And I reload.","response":"DM: So you go ahead and reload. Yeah, that'll be your turn. That comes up to Grog!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: How close is Manta Ray?","response":"DM: The creature is approximately… 40ish feet away, at an angle, so it's about 50 feet away from you, up in the air."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How long is that chain on the axe?\nTRAVIS: I was going to do something else.","response":"DM: You can try and shift your weight to the back of the boat and get closer with your movement, if you want."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I don't think the chain's long enough. 50 feet long? Is the Chain of Returning long enough to get to him?","response":"DM: You can certainly try."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to use a run action, just double speed. I feel action above, and I'm just shark instincts.","response":"DM: Okay. So you manage to get some distance for the ship, pulling it further behind."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, I have a swim speed of 40.\nASHLEY: Okay! I'm going to send a Guiding Bolt to the flying manta ray. So, I have to roll and see if it hits?","response":"DM: Yes. Add your spell modifier to it. Oh, you found your sheet?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah, I did.","response":"DM: Awesome."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: It doesn't hit. It's 12.","response":"DM: 12 does not hit, unfortunately. Once again, you fire and you think you hit one of them, but it seems to hit one of the group of three that's now flying overhead, and one shimmers and vanishes, seemingly unaffected by the bolt, but that one image of it disappears."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I do anything else? Since I'm just sitting.","response":"DM: No, not unless you want to move somewhere in the boat."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: No. Dang it!\nSAM: Are those real?\nLAURA: I don't know.","response":"DM: It's then that that strange moaning sound it's making (moans) begins to grow louder and louder, and all of you close your ears for a second. Everybody, make a wisdom saving throw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Including me?","response":"DM: You don't actually hear in the water. You're muffled."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm in the water, yeah.","response":"DM: It's to the point where it doesn't actually affect you. Plus, you're in shark form."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh crap, wisdom?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Aw!\nSAM: I rolled a two, but my wisdom is negative two.\nSAM: So I'm at a zero.\nORION: I rolled a four.","response":"DM: Four. Percy?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: One.","response":"DM: One? Oh no. Grog?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no! Our whole party!\nTRAVIS: 13.\nASHLEY: 12.\nLAURA: 11.\nLIAM: 14.\nSAM: Oh boy!\nTALIESIN: We are killing it!","response":"DM: Grog and Vex. Now let's see. You rolled a what?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I rolled an 11.","response":"DM: 11? Okay, yeah, so, no. Vax however, is okay. So, Kima, Vax, and Grog, and Clarota all hear this horrible moaning sound and plug their ears and shake it off, not a problem. Everyone else–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Instant peril.","response":"DM: This creature– all of a sudden, its form becomes far more frightening than you ever saw before. It almost seems to swell with the cavern."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is it casting a spell?","response":"DM: It's a natural ability. All of you are considered frightened."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh my lord!\nSAM: Is it charming us?","response":"DM: Nope. It is not a charm effect. It is a fear effect. You are scared of it, currently."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket is immune to being scared. It doesn't matter, because I'm scared.","response":"DM: You're scared. Trinket's not affected, but you are. Essentially, until the end of its next turn, it's disadvantage on all attack rolls, and you cannot move closer to it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I take that turn now?","response":"DM: You can take that turn now, yeah. As it's moaning."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Now, since I shook it off, I'm like, “That's lovely,” and I would like to try, for the first time, Intimidating Presence.\nSAM: Is that a spell?\nTRAVIS: On a creature within 30 feet.","response":"DM: It would be within 30 feet. Turn around."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Get it!\nLAURA: Get it Grog, get it!\nTRAVIS: (yells)\nTRAVIS: 13.","response":"DM: 13 for what kind of saving throw?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Wisdom saving throw.","response":"DM: Okay, for the creature. Wisdom saving throw. It rolls a 12."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's right, bitch! He's frightened until the end of the next turn.\nLAURA: Does that cancel out our fear?","response":"DM: It doesn't cancel out yours. It just means it's further away and can't get closer to Grog."}
{"prompt":"SAM: But we're still scared of it.\nORION: What's the creature made out of? What's his skin like when I look at him?","response":"DM: It looks leathery. It has almost the texture of a very, very thick bat or lizard skin. But it's very dark, from what you can see. You've had just little glimpses of it here and there. Most of it's been shrouded in shadow. It's almost like a thick leather cloak that's come to life."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, I don't really– Hey! What do you think I should do, guys?\nTRAVIS: Knock it into the water. Let the shark have at it.\nSAM: Can you make us faster? Can you haste her, or anything?\nORION: Haste doesn't work that way now.\nLAURA: How high are the ceilings? Can you pillars it down into the water?\nSAM: Just defer.\nORION: I'll defer for now.","response":"DM: Okay, so Tiberius, you move your movement to later."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We can't sail away–\nSAM: Can you shake us? Can you shake our magic fear?","response":"DM: Not unless you have an anti-fear spell. Scanlan, you're up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to attack at disadvantage, I guess, with… I'm going to create a big hand right in front of him, to stall him with the Bigby's Hand.\nASHLEY: Talk to the hand!\nTRAVIS: Bigby's Hand?\nORION: Bigby Hand? Nice!\nSAM: It's this guy I know. His name's Bigby, he has a big hand.\nSAM: I'm going to grapple and try to get it into the water","response":"DM: Oh, Grasping Hand?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Ooh.\nSAM: What do I do? What do I roll?","response":"DM: Strength of 26, so roll d20 plus eight."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Come on!\nSAM: I don't know what that is. Is that a six or a nine?\nLAURA: There should be a dot on one side.\nSAM: It's a nine!","response":"DM: Okay, so nine plus eight. You're at 17. Its contest was at 15. Oh, but you are at disadvantage. So roll again."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, come on…\nLAURA: Don't be lower.\nSAM: 14. Yeah, I'm good.","response":"DM: Okay, so as you rear back, your eyes squinting, just scared to even do anything with this creature, you try out this new spell that you've only just recently managed to conjure to your attention."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, I don't know. Does it fall from gravity, or does it just it stay there, locked in?","response":"DM: It's locked in where you're holding it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Then I'll just lock it there.","response":"DM: Okay, so you lock it there. Great. You can use a bonus action to crush it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh yeah, I can crush it. Yeah, I also give it a little squeeze. A little tickle.","response":"DM: So as you're holding it in place, you use your bonus action to squeeze it. It takes 2d6 plus five bludgeoning damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 11 plus five. 16.","response":"DM: 16, nice. As it is currently held in place, screeching (screech, crunch) you hear this strange crushing sound of bones breaking on the inside of its strange form."}
{"prompt":"SAM: This is the strongest I've ever been!\nLAURA: Hunter's Mark!\nLAURA: And I'm going to attack him twice! Because I'm original.\nTRAVIS: I have one thing I do.\nLAURA: 16.","response":"DM: 16 does hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And 28.\nLIAM: Does it cancel out the disadvantage?","response":"DM: It does not, technically. It just means he can move it, so yeah, it does not cancel out the disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, so I've got to roll a couple more times?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They both hit. They're both high.","response":"DM: Okay, great. There you go. So, as you're on the boat, you can see the hand grasping. It gives you a moment of bravery. You pull out (swoosh, swoosh) let loose two more arrows into the slightly dark, shrouded exterior of the boat. Both arrows strike true into the currently-grappled cloak-like creature."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 26 for those two. Plus Hunter's Mark. Oh, wait! No, 30 for those two. And nine for Hunter's Mark.","response":"DM: Nice. Portions of it are trying to squeeze free of this arcane hand. One strikes through its wing, leaving a gaping wound in the middle, where you can see it's going to have a hard time maintaining height at this point. The second one strikes it and actually pierces one of its red, glowing eyes. It gives out this horrible, painful screeching sound (screech) into the cavern as you can now see what was once two gleaming red, piercing eyes, left with only one, and darkness on the other side of its face."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes! Yes!\nASHLEY: Ooh!","response":"DM: That brings us to Kima and Clarota. Kima, at this point in time is, unfortunately, at a disadvantage of finding out what to do at this distance, being a paladin. She is going to attempt–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The middle finger.","response":"DM: Nothing. She's going to wait it out."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I see what happens.","response":"DM: So you're taking your turn after Laura?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes. I'll follow suit. I'm going to… I'm going to straight-up cast this because I have to. I cast Telekinesis and I pull the eye out. (sucking noise)\nLAURA: Ew.\nTRAVIS: Kill Bill-style, right?","response":"DM: Interesting! Okay. So Clarota, at this time, is also going to attempt a Mind Blast on the creature. It moves to the back of the boat and while it's currently grappled, he's going to attempt that. The saving throw does succeed, so it only takes half damage. Okay. Marking that. And then as you do Telekinesis. Roll a d20 plus five."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay. And do I have advantage because of the grapple?","response":"DM: The grapple does not give you advantage, no. So you have disadvantage on the roll, technically, because you are scared of it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And that's my what?","response":"DM: Plus five."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17.\nLAURA: Put it in a little vial. Keep it for later.\nORION: I'm going to float it over and put it in one of my vials.","response":"DM: Okay. Write down in your inventory, “cloaker eye.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to smell it, first of all.\nORION: No.\nLAURA: Not good.\nTALIESIN: You know exactly where that's been.","response":"DM: This guy's not having a good day. Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. First one is 26.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Second one is 26.","response":"DM: Hits. Because it is blinded, you do have advantage on it– not advantage; you are able to sneak attack."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I've no idea what we're even fighting.\nLIAM: 23.\nLIAM: I saw where Tiberius pulled the eye out, and that's what I'm aiming at, its eye socket. So I flip it in the air, and when I catch it, I immediately let go and fill in the blank.","response":"DM: Okay!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: “Socket” to me.","response":"DM: So as the creature is flailing about in torturous pain, suddenly the dagger (fwoosh, thunk) sinks into the empty socket in the front of its face. As it does, its body tenses up and reaches out against the force of your arcane hand. You actually have to focus to keep it in place in its final death throes. All of its tension and then it falls limp within your grasp. You now have this limp creature at your disposal."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I'm going to bring him to the boat.","response":"DM: As Scanlan slowly drifts over the limp body of this creature to the edge of the boat–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What was it? Can we loot him?\nLAURA: Does he have teeth and scales and neat things?\nLIAM: It's a cloaker, because that was a cloaker's eye.\nTALIESIN: Can we fashion it into a sail?\nSAM: That's a good idea.","response":"DM: There is no wind in this tunnel."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can make one.\nSAM, TALIESIN, AND LAURA: We can make wind.\nASHLEY: We do have an Air Ashari.\nLAURA: We have a Grog.\nTRAVIS: Oh, we can make wind.\nTALIESIN: Grog will make wind.\nORION: I rolled a 16 for a history check on the creature.","response":"DM: History's not going to do much for you. Nature is what you're going to want to do. Nature or arcana, those are the two."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So that's 14. Oh, no. Arcana?","response":"DM: Roll for arcana."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah. 25.","response":"DM: Yep. This creature is a cloaker. It's an aberration. It's one of those creatures that drifts over from the Far Realm, or at some point in time drifted over from the Far Realm and is an unnatural entity to this plane. They normally live subterranean. When not moving, they are nearly invisible and blend in, almost like a straight leather cloak left and discarded to the side, hence the name “cloaker.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I've got a great idea. I want to sit, and I want to skin this thing.\nORION: Well, yes. I want the teeth, also.\nTALIESIN: You can have the teeth. I'm going to skin it.","response":"DM: Okay. So you guys are now currently in this boat, drifting along in the open area over on that side."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should we make our way to the little island?\nTALIESIN: Or we could go to those strange buildings that are off in the northwest corner.\nLAURA: All the way up and over?\nMARISHA: Oh, well, I was going to say we could go into this cave here.\nSAM: Maybe move it this way so the people can see.\nLAURA: Oh yeah, it's right on the edge.\nTALIESIN: Keep going. There you go.\nMARISHA: Well, what about this cave?\nLAURA: The only thing is, I'm afraid that if we keep using up all our spells, then we won't be able to take down the big baddie if we come to him.\nMARISHA: We need a rest.\nLAURA AND ASHLEY: We need rest.\nMARISHA: I want to be able to use my scrying spell before we try anything.\nLAURA: Oh, okay. So should we make our way to this cave?\nMARISHA: Sure.\nTRAVIS: Good, we'll do that.\nORION: How close are we? How long will that take?","response":"DM: If you guys start heading that direction, you'll find out."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's start heading that direction, and I want to skin this creature.","response":"DM: Okay, as you guys are moving along, you leave a little space for Percy. It's a little unwieldy in the ship. It's hard for you to do this, so it's not going to be the best job."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Not going for craftsmanship.","response":"DM: Fair enough. As you're plucking what you think might be interesting from this creature's body, as in the process of skinning it, you probably take a moment to realize that a normal blade is going to have a hard time cutting through its hide, so you might have to borrow one."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm making a camo canopy for the boat.","response":"DM: Yeah, this is going to be a survival check on this. Roll survival."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I rolled a natural 20 to help him with any arcana enchantment if he succeeds.\nTALIESIN: 17.","response":"DM: 17? Did you add the inspiration dice to that?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I didn't.","response":"DM: You don't have to if you don't want to."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm keeping it for later.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, it only lasts ten minutes.\nTALIESIN: Oh, does it only last ten minutes?\nORION: A lot can happen in ten minutes.\nTALIESIN: Oh, in that case, 26.","response":"DM: 26 would make a difference. In the confined space on this ship, as you guys crest around towards the northern side of that island, you begin to move around. You can see to the right of you, there is this tunnel that filters out the side of this cavern that's just a continuation of the water, a river on the far end. You don't know where it goes. It disappears in the darkness, and you can hear in the distance the light sound of rushing water."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I use my shark eyes to look down the tunnel?","response":"DM: It begins to curve about 20 feet in, so you're unable to make much past that distance, and it looks like a continuation of the water flowing through, or into; you're not quite able to tell from this distance."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: For you.","response":"DM: So that comes to roughly 45 cloaker teeth. You don't know what that'll be worth, but you have that at your disposal. So you can write down, “45 cloaker teeth.” You manage to skin most of it. You get most of the top of its hide usable. It's still wet. It'll take a while to do that, let alone in an area where it's dry on the surface. But you manage to pull most of the top of it off, so you have this wet, skinned portion of the back of the cloaker at your disposal."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to build a relative canopy specifically for the left side of the boat so that we're protected and visibly obscured from anybody in the city.","response":"DM: Okay. Make a tinker check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What's the bonus on that, again?","response":"DM: Well, for that, it should be dex, I believe."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Dex, thank you. (raspberry noise)","response":"DM: Plus four, because you're proficient with it. So it's your dex plus your proficiency modifier."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 11.","response":"DM: 11?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I rolled really badly.","response":"DM: Yeah, you did. You still have the hide. In the time it takes for you to get to the beach, you don't have much material at your disposal, and to fashion anything that's on that side, the most you manage to get is a slight lift to it, and by the time you get to the beach, it just collapses on itself."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. Once we're at the beach and we have all evening, I'll make another attempt.","response":"DM: Okay, it'll take you some time. It's doable, but it'll take a while."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I had a two.\nASHLEY: It's okay.\nTRAVIS: We made our way to the beach.","response":"DM: As you make your way towards the beach, Keyleth, you see in the distance in the water what looks like something slinking on the very bottom of this underground lake. Probably a good 50, 60 feet down, you can barely make out what looks like a dark form, probably about 100 to 150 feet away, and it's only because of your shark form that you're able to make out any sort of semblance of it, but it looks big, and it looks like it's slowly moving through the bottom of the lake. Doesn't seem to be moving towards you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's just a thing. There's going to be things here.\nSAM: What if it's just like one of those party cruises where they–\nTRAVIS: On the bottom of the–\nTALIESIN: Submersive party cruise.\nLAURA: How close are we to the cave? Are we still really far away?","response":"DM: You guys are maybe 300 feet from the beach."}
{"prompt":"SAM: But we don't see it because we're on deck, right?","response":"DM: The creature? No, only Keyleth does."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I drop them off at the beach.\nTALIESIN: Let's dry-dock the boat.","response":"DM: Okay, I'm going to ask Keyleth to make a stealth check in shark form."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A shark stealth. Stealth shark.","response":"DM: The dex bonus of a shark form is zero, so just roll a d20."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's not true. It's plus one.","response":"DM: Giant shark? According to here… it says one. It's a zero. Dex is 11."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I was looking at mine.\nSAM: Shark argument!\nMARISHA: It's okay. 17.","response":"DM: 17, okay. As you deftly drag the boat at just the right distance to curve around this large subterranean form, it doesn't seem to take notice, and eventually drifts far enough away where you can no longer make any sort of visual connection with its form. You make your way to the side of the beach. You drag up to the point where the ship begins to hit the gravel. You begin to move, curve to the side, and it (grinding sound) lifts up and comes to a rest at the top of the gravel beach. You guys all step off the boat. Okay, Grog, you go ahead and haul the boat up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us right now.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I go ahead and un-shark myself.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I'm going to look for bad things on the beach.\nSAM: Yeah, what's the layout of the beach? Is it just a beach?","response":"DM: Okay, so looking at the beach here, it's an open beach. You can see there are a few rock formations, small 15-foot-tall portions of stalagmites or stone that either have been here for a long time or have been constructed or put there to jut out of that part of the beach. But for the most part, it's just an open gravel beach that slowly comes to stop at the edge of the cavern, and there is a tunnel about 15, 20 feet wide ahead of you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is there a half-submerged Statue of Liberty, or anything?","response":"DM: Perception check?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I got a 16 for my perception.","response":"DM: 16. You do not see any sort of half-submerged Statue of Liberty. My apologies."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How far away are we from the main island? Is it like DUMBO to Manhattan distance?","response":"DM: Yeah, I'd say it's probably about a good half a mile or so."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would like to perceive if Lady Kima has been giving me any second looks after I intimidated old Flappy Wings.","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Ten, plus… probably nothing. Yeah, nothing. Ten.","response":"DM: It's hard to tell. She seems very focused on the task at hand. Her eyes have been, for the most part, up in the air around you. Unfortunately, Grog, you don't think she's paying much mind to you at the moment because she's more concerned about keeping the group alive and where you guys are currently headed. You'll have to try harder to get her attentions. It's okay, Grog."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we look around the entrance and see if anything dangerous looks like it's around? I'm looking up on the ceiling.","response":"DM: Yeah, now that you know the idea of what to look for, for a cloaker, go ahead and make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 29.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys glance around and, currently looking at the walls on the exterior of this beach area, nothing matches the description of what you saw in the previous cavern. For the time being, it looks relatively safe on this part of the beach."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nLIAM: And there's caves?","response":"DM: There is a singular cave on the far end. There's a slight outcropping, and then it leads into that one 20-foot-wide cavern that goes deeper in there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to creep up just to the edge of the cave. I'm not going to go in. Is it a separate perception check for the inside of the cave as well?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Stealth check is good. It's a 21. 31.","response":"DM: 31, okay. So making your way up, you dodge from low on the side of the beach, jumping in front of these strange stone platforms, keeping in, look for cover. You make your way up against the side of a wall, begin to glance inside. Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And that is 19.","response":"DM: 19. It's pitch-black in the cavern. You have no light source, unfortunately. You have darkvision, which does help you to a certain extent. You cannot see the entirety of the cavern, but you can see about, let's say, 40 to 60 feet in. The beach gravel comes to a halt and comes to this smooth stone flooring. You don't see anything that particularly catches your attention."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Manufactured or made, or just paved floor?","response":"DM: It looks like it has some natural change in the topography. It's not a polished floor, but it's definitely been worn over time."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we maybe try to look in?\nORION: Could be a tide cave.\nTRAVIS: We have firewood bundles and stuff.\nMARISHA: I'm wet. That was a really cold lake.\nORION: Prestidigitation! Now you're all dry.\nLIAM: It's very hard to know, though. It's dark in there.\nLAURA: Should we just light it up, see what's in there?\nTALIESIN: Let's light it up. See what happens.\nLAURA: Hey, Tiberius?\nORION: Yes? Oh, Light!\nLAURA: I shoot the arrow.","response":"DM: Okay. So as you cast Light on the arrow, it's blinding. You know at this point to close that one eye as you release it in the distance."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh wait, wrong eye.","response":"DM: There you go. That's the one."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right, right.","response":"DM: You fire the arrow into the depth of this cavern. Before the Light spell wears off, it arcs inward and it hits the back wall and ricochets off. Looking inside, it all looks like a natural cavern interior. The light is the same glowing white light that you're used to. Once it enters the deep part of the cave, the light almost gets a purplish hue before it's snuffed out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This doesn't seem very good.\nASHLEY: Wait, the light gets a purplish hue?","response":"DM: The white light becomes purple and then (ffft) is snuffed."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I want to do an arcana check. 18. Check for any nasty magic.","response":"DM: At this distance, it's hard to make out any sort of source. You don't sense anything directly, at your distance. You'd probably have to get deeper in the cave to make a true assessment of the magical source."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, you didn't add ten to your stealth. Pass Without a Trace.","response":"DM: You have Pass Without a Trace now, too?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, I already– yeah.\nLIAM: So my stealth was at a 41.\nSAM: What do we do? We've got to get– someone's going in.\nTRAVIS: Want me to go in?\nSAM: Yeah, man! Go in!\nOTHERS: No!\nLIAM: No, if anyone's going in, send me. I'm at a 41 stealth, and if we stay on the beach, we're in view of the main island.\nLAURA: We've got to try to hide a little bit.\nASHLEY: So the arrow's not still lit? It just went through? Can you Light, Tiberius?\nLAURA: Just get some light in there. Can you put Daylight in there?\nLIAM: Tiberius, my dagger. Do the dagger.\nORION: Well, sure, but it means that thing will be bright the whole time.\nLIAM: I would lose stealth.\nORION: Yes, you would.\nMARISHA: Pike, can you check–\nASHLEY: I have darkvision.","response":"DM: Yes, as do a lot of you guys."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh, we all do.\nLAURA: Can you see if it's evil?\nSAM: Light a fire. Let's just light a fire and throw it in there.\nLIAM: Non-magical.\nTRAVIS: We have torches.\nLIAM: Yeah, throw a torch in.\nSAM: Yeah, let's just toss a torch.\nTRAVIS: I pull one of the three torches we have and, “Tiberius, will you?”\nORION: (fire breath noise)\nTRAVIS: I give it a nice long throw.\nLIAM: Do the half-elves and the gnomes see anything when there's light going through?","response":"DM: You see nothing in particular. You catch what looks almost like small whiffs of almost a mist or a fog, but it's like, (ffft) then vanish, (shh)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't think we should go in there.","response":"DM: Almost like there's this perpetually materializing and dematerializing tufts of small clouds of smoke."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Forget this. Forget this cave. Keyleth, can you do that thing you do where you make the beach look like an empty beach, or something other than it is? Can we camp on the beach instead of going in there?\nMARISHA: I can.\nORION: Let's do that. I agree. I'm tired.\nMARISHA: What if this is a clue or something important?\nSAM: Yeah, we've never shied away from a confrontation before.\nORION: Pike, can you sense if there's any nasties down there?\nASHLEY: Can I use Dispel Magic?","response":"DM: You can attempt to, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, I'll attempt.","response":"DM: Okay. So Pike, as you step up to the mouth of the cave, looking where the torchlight is, you cast Dispel Magic. As you formulate your divine energy, grasping onto your symbol of Sarenrae around your neck, you can see this strange pulsing shimmer of divine energy that clears out the area. The purplish hue to the light vanishes and the light becomes a natural torchlight for a moment and all the wisps of smoke vanish… then slowly filter back into the space."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We don't need to go in there.\nSAM: Indeed. If only we had someone who could go under the ground and be one with the earth and pop up in there and look around– no?\nLAURA: But she'll be popping up into the wisps.\nSAM: Yeah, but she'll be fine!\nTRAVIS: Wall it up!\nLAURA: I think just wall it up. Can we see anything sparkling? Can we look in and see if there's anything that looks useful?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, do I see any shapes and colors and sparkly things?\nASHLEY: Should we check for traps?","response":"DM: It's hard to tell. You can't see the entire cavern from this distance, because the cavern opens up and then curves around. There's a whole portion you can't see without entering it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right, Lady Kima?\nORION: Right. I suggest we go and rest. I believe we can get some respite.\nLIAM: The only question is, do we want to try to rest here under some sort of illusion, or do we go to the island we can see?\nLAURA: No, because the island's way over back here.\nTALIESIN: We rest here. We take shifts. We should be fine.\nLIAM: We could sail there to the northwestern edge of the island. There's some sort of structure there.\nLAURA: I think we rest up before we do that.\nMARISHA: What if there's something in this cavern that could help us, though?\nLAURA: Can you wall it up?\nTRAVIS: Between you and Tiberius, with the columns and stuff?\nMARISHA: We could. How about this?\nTRAVIS: I don't need to rest, so I can just stand guard.\nMARISHA: How about I do what Scanlan says?\nSAM: Oh. Hello.\nTALIESIN: That always works.\nMARISHA: Yes, I know. I think this is the first time I've said this, ever. Maybe I'll try what Scanlan says and I'll turn into a rock elemental and just bamf in there and see if there's anything good, and if it's bad, I'll just run out and make a rock wall.\nSAM: Oh. Okay.\nMARISHA: Maybe? Okay?\nTRAVIS: Go for it.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, let's go for it. This is a terrible plan. I think it's a great idea.\nMARISHA: Let's do it. I like it.\nSAM: Yeah, let's send in one person.\nORION: As soon as I see Her Royalty go in–\nLIAM: Can I ask one quick question before we go? Regardless of what happens, if there is something shitty in here or not, are we camping here afterward?\nOTHERS: Yes.\nLIAM: We're sure? Okay. Then I click my Boots of Haste.\nMARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast Enhance Ability on myself before I do that, and give myself… extra wisdom.\nMARISHA: I want to be a perceptive bastard while I'm in there.","response":"DM: So Keyleth transforms herself into her earth elemental form."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Rah. That's what rocks say.\nTALIESIN AND MARISHA: Rah.\nSAM: I'm going to inspire her with a little dolphin dance or something. Whatever that is. I don't know, I'm just going to–","response":"DM: It's hard to explain why, but his strange shimmy is slightly inspiring. You've learned something about yourself today that you hope nobody else wants to bring up in conversation. You get a d10 inspiration dice."}
{"prompt":"ORION: As soon as I see Keyleth go off, I rub my ring and go invisible.","response":"DM: Okay. So as you guys all mount into your defensive positions, Keyleth, are you going straight through? Are you going beneath, above?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Burrow beneath. I'll go, “(deep voice) Bye-bye.”","response":"DM: This large earth elemental form takes a few lumbering steps forward, and begins to sink into the sand and gravel below, just (shifting sound)."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: “Oh yeah, wait, have you guys seen this one?”\nMARISHA: As I go into the ground.","response":"DM: The most awkward earth elemental exit ever."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: “I'll take the elevator.”\nTRAVIS: I think it's the funniest thing I've ever seen.\nMARISHA: With advantage, right?","response":"DM: This is wisdom, yep."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's a 13. That's a 19! I'll take that one.\nMARISHA: 29.","response":"DM: 29. You take a moment and formulate your vision, the firelight still trickling through, although you have darkvision. You look about the room, and you can see there is a strange energy about the room. There's something about this room that feels similar to when you encountered the Frost Plane during the first Westruun winter's veil encounter. There's a type of energy that seems to be brought into being whenever you've caught a mind flayer shifting and bamfing out of any sort of combat you come into. There's something about this room that seems like it's crossing over or has a thin barrier with some other plane."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's a gate.","response":"DM: You don't see a particular doorway, but it feels like there is a very thin veil here, and as you focus more on the vicinity, you can see what looks like little bits of energy that leak through. That mist you were seeing seems to be elements where the actual reality of this room is warping temporarily, and shifting."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: It's like Stargate.\nMARISHA: Can I take a piece of rock and toss it up?","response":"DM: You take it and you throw it up. It arcs across, hits the other side of the room, and clatters to the ground. As it clatters to the ground, you suddenly see, lightning-quick, five of these large, fast-moving, slithering weird creatures that were up against the wall and now visible at this point strike at the rock and seem to start fighting each other for whatever that movement was. They're large, bluish and purple in color when it shifts in its form, with these sharp beaks and what looks like four tentacles that wrap out from the face."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's familiar.\nSAM: Maybe they're friendly!","response":"DM: Make a nature check, if you want. No, this would be arcana. Arcana. This wouldn't be nature."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You've got a number there.\nMARISHA: I've got a vague number. 11.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait! Plus four. 15.","response":"DM: Arcana is intellect, though. It's not wisdom, is it?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I used Scanlan's die.","response":"DM: Oh, you did? Oh, I see. 15. Unable to really make out more than you've heard of creatures like this. Unlike most aberrations and creatures that seem to bleed over from different planes of existence, this one is not an aberration in its form. This is just a subterranean monstrosity. It's known as a grick."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: A grick.","response":"DM: Essentially, it looks like that."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Ew!\nSAM: Show the people at home.\nTRAVIS: I automatically don't like it.","response":"DM: As they all take a moment and realize that whatever they were fighting over is not living and not moving, they hiss at each other and slowly find other alcoves and what you can now see are small caves that are dug into the rock nearby. Something draws them to this room, as any natural space with this strange, fluctuating energy would do so."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But they're not necessarily bleeding through from the other plane. They come from this plane.","response":"DM: It seems to be, yeah. They're not too weird. They're weird, but they're not too weird."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Big worms with tentacles, but not too weird.","response":"DM: You've seen it all."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: They're not wearing sombreros or anything.\nLAURA: So what are you doing, Keyleth? Are you staying in there?\nTRAVIS: Please say no.\nMARISHA: I'm just going to seep back down.\nLIAM: Take the stairs, though.\nMARISHA: I take the stairs.\nMARISHA: But before I reappear, I go, “Grog. I'm in a boat.”\nTRAVIS: She's in the floor! And she's in a boat! It's magic. (giggles)\nLIAM: It is pretty funny.\nTRAVIS: Will you teach me that sometime?\nMARISHA: “No.”\nMARISHA: I'm not an elemental anymore.\nMARISHA: I go, “Tee-hee-hee, shh.”\nASHLEY: Make a wall!\nLAURA: Wait, what did you see, Keyleth?\nSAM: Wait, is she back?","response":"DM: Yeah, her elemental form is gone. She's now back into Keyleth's form."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're all just on the beach.\nORION: I'm not.\nSAM: Thanks, Ti.\nORION: Pike is chuckling, at best.\nLAURA: What was it? Was there anything in there?\nMARISHA: It seemed like it had Dimension Door properties, but I don't know if it was necessarily at full Dimension Door strength.\nLAURA: Were there creatures?\nMARISHA: There were creatures. There appeared to be these things that I've heard of, called gricks. They're like worms with beaks and tentacles.\nLAURA: Oh, I've heard of gricks. They're really fast.\nMARISHA: Yeah, they're super-fast.\nLAURA: Yeah, they slither.\nLAURA: Yeah, man. I studied the Underdark.\nMARISHA: They did this whole Hungry Hungry Hippos thing.\nSAM: But you said it was a gate to another dimension?\nMARISHA: It seemed to be some sort of dimensional gateway. I don't know which dimension.\nSAM: I we come across any people that we can beat information out of, we might want to ask them if this a known thing, a gateway back to the overworld.\nLAURA: I think it would probably go to the Abyss or something.\nLIAM: Or a shortcut into the–\nMARISHA: Into the temple.\nLAURA: I wonder, do they attack things? They seemed really fast, right?\nMARISHA: The grick things? Yeah.\nLAURA: Percy can you make a bomb?\nSAM: Oh, he did already. I've got it. I have a bomb.\nLAURA: Can you throw the bomb in there and they would all maybe attack it, and maybe it would blow them up?\nSAM: Maybe. It might hit some of them. Do we want to go in there? Because we can certainly do that.\nLAURA: Just throw it from outside and see what happens.\nMARISHA: If we take a few minutes and I take another breather– because being a rock elemental takes it out of you for a little bit– and you guys can make some bombs, I can go back in there as an elemental.\nORION: Actually, I think that's a good idea. Percy? The bomb that Scanlan is holding, could you fix a thing around it to possibly hold magic properties?\nTALIESIN: I have not the slightest clue how to do that.\nORION: You can use some of this– one of the glass, my potion– what do you call those fucking things?\nTRAVIS: Vials?\nORION: Yes.\nSAM: Are we right outside the mouth of the cave right now?\nLAURA: We are really close to it.\nSAM: Can we get away from the mouth of the cave?\nTRAVIS: Okay, who needs to rest? Show of hands, who needs rest?\nMARISHA: I'm going to rest while they talk. While they figure out a plan.\nLIAM: Tibber-hoods, do you have any fireballs left in you?\nSAM: T-Money, what do you think?\nORION: I cast Silence on Vax.\nSAM: I cast Dispel Magic.\nORION: Counterspell!\nSAM: Counter-counterspell!\nORION: Do you have Counterspell? You don't have Counterspell.\nSAM: No.\nORION: Counterspell just fizzles his shit.","response":"DM: What level is your spell?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's a level three spell?","response":"DM: So, no, your spell just (pfft)."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Damn it.\nORION: And I don't silence him. Did I have to roll anything to do that?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, cool.","response":"DM: He has to make a save for Silence."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Am I silenced?","response":"DM: What's the save on that one?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17.","response":"DM: Right, but what's the actual save? Is it wisdom, is it intelligence?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, I rolled pitifully, so it probably doesn't matter.\nORION: I just know it's 120-foot range. Should write the other stuff down.\nLAURA: Tiberius, was that really necessary?\nORION: “No, it wasn't. But yes, I do have fireballs left.” And I dispel it immediately.\nLIAM: (yells incoherently)\nLAURA: Shh!\nLIAM: I didn't know he was going to dispel it!\nORION: I'm unpredictable.\nASHLEY: Because I have Spiritual Weapon, maybe I can try to create a crazy-ass bomb type of thing.\nSAM: We have a bomb.","response":"DM: You do know that the essence of Spiritual Weapon, it creates a weapon that is partially in form with your deity's weapon of choice or preference. It's mainly melee weapons. Nothing too intricate."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We are not making a holy hand grenade.\nLAURA: We already have a bomb. Just throw it in, they attack it, we close them up.\nSAM: I have a bomb.\nTRAVIS: We've got a bomb.\nORION: With what Vex is getting to, Percy, is if you could fashion such a thing, or if I could, I'll enchant it.\nLAURA: Throw a bomb, they attack it, then you can throw a fireball at the same time. We just have to get them in a cluster.\nORION: Can I attempt to imbue the bomb with a fireball in it?","response":"DM: No, that is a Delayed-Blast Fireball, which is a higher-level spell."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay.\nASHLEY: Throw the bomb in.\nLAURA AND LIAM: One-two punch.\nTRAVIS: Scanlan, toss it.\nSAM: I'm not a good thrower. Is that what you call it, thrower?\nMARISHA: Here, give it to me and I'll go in as an elemental.\nLIAM: No, we can just throw it.\nLAURA: Just throw it!\nSAM: Then you'll have to hit it to light it.\nASHLEY: Who has really good dexterity?\nORION: You have a bomb?\nSAM: I have a bomb.\nORION: Hold it out in your hand, please.\nSAM: I don't want to touch it. It's a saddlebag bomb.\nLIAM: I'm not trying to get it into a basket.\nLAURA: We just need to throw it into the cave.\nORION: I cast Telekinesis. I pick up the bomb, and I start guiding it into the cave.\nLAURA: Is it so hard to just throw a freaking bomb into a cave?\nSAM: It's already in!\nORION: Pay attention, ranger.","response":"DM: So the bomb that was constructed ages ago by Percy that was originally intended to put on a summoned pony."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes. Never got to use it.","response":"DM: But now is finally being used. Tiberius, you approach the edge of the cavern. Make a stealth check."}

{"prompt":"ORION: Oh. Dope.\nLAURA: And you have Pass Without a Trace.\nORION: Yes. What's with that, so.","response":"DM: Invisibility and Telekinesis are both concentration spells. You would lose your Invisibility to cast Telekinesis."}

So as you make your way up to the edge of the cavern, you come in partially, you guide the bomb towards the back, and you lob it towards the far end.

The bomb hits the wall, hits the ground, tumbles for a second, awkwardly slumps over on itself. At which point, in a blur of motion, the strange hissing sound, a bunch of momentum hits the room and you see all these creatures begin attacking it–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: As soon as I hear that noise, Fireball.\nLAURA: What's the point of the bomb? Why not just do that?\nLIAM: It'll ignite the bomb.\nLAURA: You're right, it will, yeah.","response":"DM: So. The fireball impacts the far end of the wall, where the cluster of these strange worm creatures are. It explodes with a large, blasting, echoing explosion sound."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm doing this.","response":"DM: Hold your ears. Roll damage on that."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I take my shield and put it in front of a couple people.\nTALIESIN: Scanlan, is there any way you could absorb this sound?\nMARISHA: Yeah, could we cast Silence?\nSAM: Nope. He can't. Too late. He's casting like seven spells right now.\nLIAM: Once we finish this math, this explosion is going to be really cool.\nLAURA: And really loud.\nORION: 32.","response":"DM: 32 points of damage?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.","response":"DM: That blasts open. Percy, roll 4d6 points of damage from the actual bomb as the fireball detonates the saddlebag simultaneously with the explosion of the fireball."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 14 points of damage. 4d6.\nTALIESIN: Oh, god.","response":"DM: Pitch-black smoke comes pouring out of the cavern. You have to guard yourself."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's going to attract some attention.","response":"DM: As the smoke slowly clears, you get a glance in there and you can see there are bits and pieces and chunks of grick matter across the wall and the inside of the cavern, with some gaping half-bodies of these creatures torn open from the explosion. There is nothing living and nothing moving from what you can see at the center of this cavern."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's go in!","response":"DM: The occasional (dripping sounds) chunks dripping off the ceiling."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Excellent.\nASHLEY: Is the magic dispelled? For sure?\nLAURA: Take a couple steps in, and perception.","response":"DM: Perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 15.\nSAM: It was a good bomb.\nTALIESIN: It was a very good bomb.\nSAM: Thank you for crafting it for me. What do I owe you?\nTALIESIN: Your life, at this point. And a song. You owe me a song.\nSAM: Maybe start on a new one.\nLAURA: 24.","response":"DM: Okay, glancing through? You can see the small tunnels that these creatures house themselves in as a defensive position. These creatures are not hunters, they're more scavengers, but they fight in packs and wait for things to find their way in. This tunnel was definitely a place where they do that to keep fed. However, this tunnel appears to be empty other than the strange phenomenon of this energy in the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I feel we should camp here for the night.\nASHLEY: No more magic?\nORION: Or day, whenever the heck.\nLAURA: Is there anything that can come through the portal?\nTALIESIN: It's more just an energy shield.\nSAM: Before we plan something, is there a portal or something?","response":"DM: Make an arcana check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Something funky in here.\nORION: Yes, of course, that's obvious.\nLAURA: What's all this purple stuff?\nLIAM: Well, let's figure it out.\nSAM: 16.","response":"DM: 16. As you take a moment and step inside and feel the essence of it, there is no portal, there is no doorway, there is no tear. There's just a very thin veil between this plane and another. You're unable to really ascertain the nature of this energy coming through, but you're able to see there is these strange warps in reality. As you walk into this room, you look at your hands, and for a second your fingers seem to bend and go to form. As you look at people's faces, they twist and shift and then go back."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't think we should camp here.","response":"DM: You don't know if it's purely a visual thing or if matter itself is actually twisting, but it's very discombobulating being in this room for any length of time."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Clarota, what are we looking at in here?","response":"DM: Clarota, as he enters behind you guys, puts his hands together and goes, “This, I believe, is the veil where K'Varn stepped into the cavern.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, exactly. That's what I was going to say earlier.\nLAURA: Okay, Tiberius.\nORION: Me, Clarota, mm. That's what I do with Clarota.","response":"DM: The tentacles writhe around Clarota's maw."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That means he likes me.","response":"DM: “This is a boundary, a thin membrane between this Prime Material Plane and elements of the Far Realm.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The Far Realm?\nORION: Ooh, Clarota. Yes. Do you think we could, after a rest of course, conjure a way and possibly break the barrier and go to that side?","response":"DM: “You wish not to do that. Your mind would break.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, that would be awful. I need it.\nSAM: Clarota, is this a possible thing that we should maybe shut down? Could K'Varn send his allies through here?","response":"DM: “We have not the power to shut this down. It is how they overlap.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it safe to be near it?","response":"DM: “I don't know.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I got him, guys, I got him.","response":"DM: “We'll have to find out.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, at least we know this beach is secure. We should go out in the front and seal this up for the night.\nLAURA: You were rather loud. I'm afraid things might be drawn to this beach from that explosion.\nASHLEY: We could keep watch.\nTRAVIS: I don't need to rest. I'll stand guard.\nORION: This is inside and I was outside. They were hearing stuff inside.\nTALIESIN: Could this veil exist in sunlight?","response":"DM: “I do not know. I have not traveled the boundary myself.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I wonder what would happen if K'Varn was cut off from the other side of this.\nTALIESIN: That's exactly what I was thinking.\nLAURA: Maybe it would be good to block it off.\nLIAM: Or collapse it.\nTALIESIN: At least wall it off on our way out.\nSAM: Yeah, that's a good idea.\nLAURA: I like it.\nTRAVIS: Do that, you two.\nMARISHA: Like, completely cave it in?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, just block it off.\nTALIESIN: Just wall it off. Earth-meld it.\nMARISHA: I don't think throwing up a stone wall is going to necessarily stop K'Varn.\nLAURA: No, but can't you use your rock-changing ability and squish all the rocks down and close the cave off?\nTALIESIN: I was just having this conversation.\nMARISHA: I can spend time essentially collapsing the whole thing.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: I start kicking sand and gravel into the cave.\nORION: Wait, how wide is the slimmest part of the cave?","response":"DM: It's about 20, 25 feet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Keep going, Grog. You'll get there.\nLIAM: We can camp, but it's only been six or seven hours since we woke up, really.\nMARISHA: It's been longer. It was six or seven hours when we were on that side of the thing.\nTALIESIN: We did take about eight hours or so.\nASHLEY: Some of us can stay up. I can stay up, keep watch.\nTRAVIS: Me, too.\nMARISHA: There's still things I want to do.\nLIAM: Spill it, girl, spill it.\nMARISHA: Clarota?","response":"DM: “Yes?” His tentacles quiver as you call his name and he looks over at you with a curious, hungry-to-be-of-service expression on his tentacled, mind flayer face."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do you have anything that might assist me in a scrying spell to help spy on K'Varn? Maybe something in his image?","response":"DM: “I have not seen K'Varn with my mind or my eyes. I've only heard of him arriving after I was cast out of my colony.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The description of her dream.\nASHLEY: Wait, but I had a vision. I had a dream.\nLAURA: So you know what he looks like?\nMARISHA: Do you know what he looks like?\nASHLEY: Well, what I saw was like a–\nLAURA: Are those Cheez-Its you're eating right there?\nASHLEY: It's what I do when I'm thinking. I had a little snack pouch.\nTALIESIN: Crackers, all around.\nLIAM: It's lembas bread.\nASHLEY: I saw a single, twisted, unnatural black horn of–","response":"DM: Which Kima mentions again. “That. That is what we're trying to prevent making its way to the surface.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I see.\nLAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: “That's the Horn of Orcus.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Maybe you can envision the horn?\nASHLEY: Would that work?","response":"DM: “I don't know. I'm not a scrying type.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: If you'll excuse me. I reach into my pouch and pull up the Scroll of Telescription. I enchant it to reach my brother Jerahd. I write on it, “Dear brother, it seems I am in a bit of a pickle with a certain type of creature that can take control of others with its mind and do nasty things. Goes by the name of K'Varn, and the only thing I know about him is that he has a black horn. Please help. Love, Tiberius.”\nSAM: I put a little cologne on the page.\nORION: He can't smell it, Scanlan.\nSAM: Yeah, but it's always a nice gesture.\nORION: And I send it.","response":"DM: Okay, so the scribe rolls itself on top and poof, vanishes in front of you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hopefully, he answers back promptly. Jerahd is a warlock and is a wizard of the mind, arcana, things I do not know of. He could possibly help us and has access to great knowledge in this matter.\nSAM: Phone a friend.\nASHLEY: Good resource.\nLAURA: I like it.\nMARISHA: Well, I guess while we wait for him to respond, I'm going to start using all of my Stone Shape and I'm going to start vringing down this tunnel.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to work on the boat.\nMARISHA: Just start collapsing it.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Still kicking sand in.\nLAURA: While she's doing that, can I use my primeval awareness and see if there's anything undead or aberrations or things that are around us that are seeming more active?","response":"DM: Okay, you have a long distance you can pull on that one. You take a moment and concentrate. Not in your immediate vicinity. You do sense that across the way, on that island, there are hundreds of aberrations."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hundreds?\nTALIESIN: That's two zeros.","response":"DM: Hundreds. You can't make out the details, you just sense the presence. You see clusters, you see some wandering the outskirts of the island, and the center of the island, you sense there is one very strong source of aberration-based essence."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: On the outskirts of the island?","response":"DM: No, in the center."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: In the center.\nTRAVIS: In the temple.\nLAURA: So. Wait. I'm sensing… would that help you to know that K'Varn is an aberration?\nMARISHA: I'd assume anything helps.\nLAURA: I'm sensing a really strong energy of an aberration in the middle of town.\nMARISHA: Aberration in the center?\nLAURA: And that's something that would've come out of this portal. Right, Clarota?","response":"DM: Clarota gives you a look and says, “Most likely, or at least is related to the kin from the other side of the veil.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, what?\nSAM: “Or at least is related to the kin from the other side of the veil.”","response":"DM: “That.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I speak Clarota.\nMARISHA: Thank you.","response":"DM: “Pay attention, druid.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I was taking notes!\nTALIESIN: He said, “pay attention, druid.”\nSAM: While this is going on, I go near Lady Kima and I start humming. I'm going to cast Suggestion on her.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is that B-52s?\nSAM: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: I go over to the water and scoop some and pour it over my head.","response":"DM: As you're doing this, Grog, Kima, who at this point as you got out of this conversation is currently rewrapping the handle of the maul that she found earlier in the cavern, stops what she's doing, glances over at Scanlan with a very stern look and goes, “Gnome, I mean no disrespect when I say, toy with my mind again and you'll find the business end of this hammer right up your rectum.”"}
{"prompt":"ALL: Oh!\nSAM: And that's the part I need for shitting on beds, so I apologize. I apologize. I'm sorry.","response":"DM: “You've bothered me enough recently with your antics.” As she does that, she motions towards your nether region. “I'd watch it.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I do call it my antic, but yes. You're right. I'm sorry, that was disrespectful. I apologize. I tried, man, come on. I'm your wingman.","response":"DM: She keeps wrapping the handle of the maul."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Scanlan, she didn't say ant-dick, she said antic.\nSAM: Thank you, Vax.\nTRAVIS: Did it work?\nSAM: I don't think so, Grog.","response":"DM: As we're taking a rest at this moment to prepare for whatever you guys want to do next. Let's take a quick restroom break for the group."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh my god.\nLAURA: Yeah, yes, please.","response":"DM: Let's say about a five-minute break if we want to just play three videos or so. We'll make it quick so we can get back to the game."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's going to be tight.\nLAURA: It's going to be tight.\nTRAVIS: Gifts. Gifts for your friends and family. Your pets.","response":"DM: Shop for your buddies' birthdays–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Your friends are going to be watching the show in under a month.\nSAM: You know what? Just buy them and then return them after the show's over.\nSAM: It's fine.\nORION: Just do that.\nSAM: We'll take it.","response":"DM: Don't do that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't do that.","response":"DM: Yeah, no worries, guys. So to bring this back to where we were, you guys have been puttering around after you're clearing out this cavern on the northern shore of this large cave surrounding Yug'Voril. What is your current plan of action?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: While they've been sleeping, I took my axe–\nSAM: Wait, did we sleep?","response":"DM: You guys didn't end up resting, I think."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, no?","response":"DM: Just been preparing."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I thought we rested.\nLAURA: No, we haven't rested.\nMARISHA: I've been collapsing that cavern.","response":"DM: You manage to make a way where the central focal point of this cavern's entrance, you manage to eventually carve all the stone to close it off."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Tiberius!\nORION: Yes?\nMARISHA: Has your brother gotten back to you yet?\nORION: He should've got the message immediately. I'm pretty sure he's researching it before he answers.","response":"DM: About 20 minutes of you doing this, as you're having this discussion, a small slip of parchment apparates in front of you with a flash of purplish energy. Written upon it, it says, “Tiberius, you speak of the Far Realm, which I am quite familiar with; there are many aberrations. However, I do not know the name K'Varn per se. In my research, there are many things that can fall under the description you say. It's vague enough. Unfortunately, I have not much to go off of. If you had an image or a visual description of this creature I'd be able to help, but at the moment I have no way of giving you any more knowledge. My apologies,” and signed at the bottom."}
{"prompt":"SAM: May I see this? (sniffs) Hmm, Draconiar Noir.\nORION: You are astute. I say all that stuff out loud.\nTRAVIS: I start digging a ditch with my axe in the sand.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What are you digging there, Grog?\nTALIESIN: I'm going to work on the camouflage.\nTRAVIS: Don't worry about it.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make another tinker check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are we in the cavern? No, we're on the beach, right?","response":"DM: You guys are on the beach."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, thank god.\nLAURA: Can we hear any kind of movement coming from the other island? Does it seem like they heard those explosions? Are we safe here?","response":"DM: The island itself I'd say is about a quarter- to a half-mile away. It's hard to tell from this distance with no light source, any movement whatsoever over there, or any sound they make over there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, so it's really dark?","response":"DM: Yes, other than the bioluminescent fungal plant life and forest that coats this side. You have no light source on that side whatsoever."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: And it's just faint enough where you can make out the outline of the island itself, but beyond that you have very little visual."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's sleep.\nMARISHA: Is there any type of stone or rock or debris with the residual energy from the purple mists of the Far Realm?","response":"DM: It doesn't necessarily cling. It's more of a presence thing than it is a material clinging energy."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nLIAM: Also, I'm sorry, if it's this dark in here, we lit up the cave. Anyone on that island would have seen that. I don't think it's very safe here.\nSAM: Where do you want to go?\nLAURA: He's doing a camouflage-y thing, and she can make it look like nothing's on the–\nLIAM: I know that, but no one camouflaged the explosion of fire that lit up the cave.\nSAM: Then let's get out of here. Why don't we go to the island and see if we can make camp?\nTALIESIN: Let's head to those little buildings off the corner there.\nMARISHA: Not yet.\nLAURA: Hide?\nORION: I do not think that is wise.\nSAM: What? What's wrong?\nMARISHA: I'm going to sit down near where the Far Plane portal is.","response":"DM: Which you already closed off at this point in time."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I want to be near it, though.","response":"DM: So you're near the edge of the wall where you've already blocked it off?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Right.","response":"DM: Okay. So you get closer to that presence."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, so I can be close to it. And Clarota? Pike? Do any of you want to help me in this?\nSAM: What are you doing?\nMARISHA: I'm going to do my scrying spell.\nSAM: Oh, okay.\nASHLEY: I can assist because I have that, as well.","response":"DM: You do have Scrying as a spell. I would say if you both expend– if you have it prepared. Do you have scrying prepared?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: No.\nMARISHA: Can I say that because I prepared it, I can be like, “Here's my book. You can borrow it. I wrote it down. I know you know it.”","response":"DM: Well, see, for druids, it's not so much a spellbook more than it is just an innate nature. You have a book for your own note-taking, but the actual spell itself comes from you harnessing the divine energy of nature around you. So there wouldn't be a way that it should be able to help you in that spell, more than a slight bonus to the DC, but I'll keep that in mind."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Would that help at all?","response":"DM: Yeah. Definitely would give inspiration."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Your Highness, hold on a second, wait a minute!\nMARISHA: What?\nORION: I think we're doing this a bit prematurely.\nMARISHA: Why?\nSAM: She can do it again tomorrow.\nORION: If she fails, he will know where we are.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nSAM: True.\nMARISHA: He knows we're here already! He possessed the queen and said, “Welcome, you're my treasured guests.” Remember that? He knows exactly where we are!\nSAM: That's a good impression.\nASHLEY: That's a really good point.\nTALIESIN: It is actually very good.\nORION: It was because he had eyes to look through.\nMARISHA: He seems to be pretty powerful and all-knowing. I'm pretty sure he probably knows we're fucking here.\nTALIESIN: I think this is a reasonable risk.\nLAURA: He's probably just playing with us right now, waiting for us to get there.\nMARISHA: He said, “You are our treasured guests.” I wrote it down.\nLIAM: He knows we're coming.\nMARISHA: He knows we're coming. He wants us to come.\nMARISHA: Oh! Good job, Grog! You did it!\nTRAVIS: Is that inspiration?","response":"DM: You feel inspired.\nMARISHA: Besides, we're talking about moving anyway, right? So I might as well do it here if we're going to relocate. Plus, I want to be near the energy of the Far Realm. Maybe it'll help a little bit?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's what I'm hoping for.\nTALIESIN: Let's go for it.\nALL: “This will be the day that I scry!”\nMARISHA: So wait, do I get two inspiration dice?","response":"DM: No. You can only have one inspiration dice at any given point in time, and it's a d10."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, but I'm happy because of Grog, right?","response":"DM: You are!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes. You get happiness.\nMARISHA: And I want to meditate specifically on the horn, and I want to use Pike and see if I can channel her vision, focusing on the horn, since that's what we really know. It's pretty much the only thing we know what it looks like.\nMARISHA: Oh, come on!","response":"DM: Apparently K'Varn has experimented on itself. These eyes are attached to strange finger-like stalks that twist out of its body. These eyes, darting around the room, looking at different directions, and then they all (whoosh) singularly shift on you at once. As it does, you can feel, all of a sudden, your presence, which has been drifting through the scrying spell, locked in place. And for a second, you feel like you can't breathe. As K'Varn presses towards you, this fleshy sphere of eyestalks and teeth, this small chuckle billows up deep within its mouth. “(chuckles) So, guest. Do you like my home? You're welcome any time.” At which point, the horn seems to glow with this creepy greenish energy, and you feel this piercing pain blast into your head. You try and scream, but you can't. There's no breath. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!\nSAM: Oh, shit. Oh god.\nMARISHA: Do I still have my Enhance Ability up?","response":"DM: No, because that's a concentration spell."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What does Keyleth look like to us right now?","response":"DM: Keyleth is sweating profusely, and you can see she's flinching."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm walking up to Keyleth and I'm grabbing her by the shirt and I'm going to slap her across the face.\nMARISHA: 27.\nMARISHA: Ow!","response":"DM: Vax is holding you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: “You were in pain, so I thought I'd fucking slap you across the face?” Gee!\nLAURA: Keyleth! Language.\nTRAVIS: Are we hitting each other now?\nMARISHA: Sorry. Wow.\nORION AND LAURA: What did you see?\nORION: So she tells us, right?\nMARISHA: K'Varn's a beholder.\nLAURA: (gasps)\nSAM: A beholder? What's that?\nORION: It is really not a thing we want to fight. It is awful. It is wretched. It will kill all of us if we don't find out a way to kill it– oh my god.\nMARISHA: Not only is K'Varn a beholder, K'Varn has been experimenting on himself and so he has armor grafted onto him, and the horn The horn which– I don't know.\nLAURA: You said there is something caging the Elder Brain right?\nMARISHA: Yes. That big green light. Can, we can see it? Is it like the Luxor in Vegas? Can we see the green light?","response":"DM: It's not a beam, but you do see a slight green glow at the top of the temple in the distance. You saw it when you first entered, and it's been this dull beacon as you traveled around this island."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So there's something connected to the top of the temple that's caging the Elder Brain?\nMARISHA: It's like an arcane prison around all of the Elder Brain.\nMARISHA: Clarota, do you know how we could possibly break this prison?\nTRAVIS: Could you tell me what a beholder is first? Because I don't know.\nSAM: Big bad scary thing.\nTRAVIS: With finger eyes?\nORION: DM, I write a detailed–\nSAM: Just hold on. Wait. Patience.","response":"DM: That's a beholder."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, the thing on the front of the Monster Manual.\nASHLEY: It's on the cover of a book.\nTRAVIS: Worst possible scenario imaginable.\nLAURA: That's all you could have said.\nLIAM: The iconic creature.\nTALIESIN: It's on the cover of Dungeons & Dragons Monthly right now. It is the cover model.\nLIAM: There's dragon, then beholder.\nMARISHA: Oh, man.\nLAURA: I mean, we've killed a dragon.\nTRAVIS: Yeah he's got lots of teeth. Let's brush 'em.\nMARISHA: Each eye tends to have a beam that has a different ability.\nSAM: Yes.\nLAURA: Oh.\nLIAM: It's a magic fun bag.\nMARISHA: It's a magic fun bag. It's probably got everything from Silence and Dispel Magic to Petrify to a disintegration ray.\nTALIESIN: You're thinking about this wrong, though. You're thinking about this in the wrong direction. Beholder is not– that's not the goal.\nLAURA: The horn is the goal.\nTALIESIN: Even more than that, it's the hundreds of allies we could have.\nLAURA: Exactly! We free the Elder Brain, they attack it.\nTALIESIN: Prison is the target.\nTRAVIS: Not the beholder?\nTALIESIN: Not the beholder. If we can free the Elder Brain–\nLAURA: We don't have to fight it ourselves.\nTALIESIN: Then we're not alone. Now, what was creating this green light? Where was it emanating from?\nMARISHA: It seemed to be emanating from the top opening of this pyramid that was the main temple of the center of town.\nTALIESIN: Can you describe the top of the pyramid?","response":"DM: I'll give you a detailed description. Essentially, this pyramid comes to a top and then flattens up at the very top. Where you would expect there to be a flat surface is instead, essentially, a windowed opening. You don't think it's purely open like you could just jump through. There is some sort of glass that coats it, but there is a brass cross-beam at the very top, and then part of this cross-beam holds aloft this strange series of metallic wires that spiral and intertwine that serves as a conical focus piece. You can't see the interior of it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So if we take out the beams–\nMARISHA: It was almost like a beehive.","response":"DM: Essentially a slow beehive."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It was focusing the energy.\nTALIESIN: We have something very important. We have a vial of yellow liquid.\nSAM: What does it do?\nLAURA: It might age you.\nMARISHA: We don't know.\nLAURA: It might do something.\nTALIESIN: It seems to be very acidic.\nSAM: So it could burn the metal?\nASHLEY: Burn the beams?\nTALIESIN: I could melt the metal and we could actually bring that entire structure crashing down.\nLAURA: But does anybody have an aging spell? Something that causes things to disintegrate things? Maybe we could rust the metal as well?\nTALIESIN: We have that yellow goop, and that would definitely help.\nLIAM: We know that it's acid?\nTALIESIN: We suspect it.\nLAURA: It might be a form changer, because the king swallowed a vial and it made him strong.\nMARISHA: Actually, I can learn Heat Metal and I can heat the beam and make it (clicks her tongue) beam.\nLAURA: He's got vials of acid in his Bag of Holding.\nASHLEY: Excellent.\nTALIESIN: We're going to break the temple.\nLAURA: Let's break the temple. Clarota?","response":"DM: At this point, as you guys look over at Clarota, you see Clarota, for the first time in a while, looks visually disturbed. Has withdrawn from the group and is leaning against the side of the beach cavern wall and the tentacles that normally slowly twirl are all tensed and pulled up into a knot."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Clarota, you're going to cramp your face if you do that.\nTALIESIN: If you have something to say, we would appreciate it.\nLIAM: If you keep making that face, it'll freeze that way.","response":"DM: “That K'Varn is of this new creature, a beholder, and carries this horn that Lady Kima has spoken of. It's a great danger. Also, keep in mind the temple is not made of average stolen metals. This is the center of the Elder Brain. We reinforce it with magical protection. It's the center of our entire species' kowledge. Every brain in there is our elders'. As we pass to the next generation, our mind is brought and introduced to the Elder Brain. We have that room protected from simple acids. We must make sure we are ready.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Clarota, Keyleth has scryed the top of the building right now. It didn't look like it was part of the original structure. Is she mistaken? Is the top something that was built by your people?","response":"DM: “No. It was open before. There seems to be some sort of new focus K'Varn has constructed.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Would that be as strong as the rest of the building?","response":"DM: “I do not know. But if I've seen anything of the nature of this insidious creature, I would say, plan for the worst. Nothing, nothing is more terrifying than underestimating a beholder.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right. Can beholders fly?\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nLAURA: They can. Okay.\nTRAVIS: Among other things, it seems like.\nLAURA: What can't they do?\nLIAM: Not much.\nTALIESIN: They're terrible monsters.\nLAURA: So they're really very fleshy and weak, but he put armor on himself.\nTRAVIS: He's super strong.\nLAURA: So now he's extra strong.\nLIAM: Like a wizard times 50.\nMARISHA: I'm assuming– oh, go ahead.","response":"DM: Then Kima says, “The key is here is not to think how to fight him head-on. We have to be smart about this. While he has the home turf, we have the element of surprise. We choose the grounds in which we attack, and we choose the methods in which we set the battlefield.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Underwater fight!\nSAM: We could try to just draw him out somehow.","response":"DM: “I highly doubt he's going to leave his home turf. But if we can find a way to perhaps turn it against him or use it to our advantage. Maybe some reconnaissance. I don't know.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Reconnaissance!","response":"DM: “I don't know!”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It is glass on the top, so we could try to Sunlight the head?\nASHLEY: I have something called Divine Intervention.\nLAURA: What is that?\nASHLEY: You can call on your deity, and you roll a percentile die, and you can have them help you with something.\nLAURA: So is it possible to try to get her help before we do this? Or is it something that you have to do on the spot?\nASHLEY: I don't know, because this is new.","response":"DM: That's up to you. You can attempt it once a day, and once it works, it can't be done for another week."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So if we attempt it, then she can intervene? She can be on our side?","response":"DM: In some way. Essentially, you formulate how you want your deity's aid. And if you succeed– you have a 10% chance of success– in some divine way, Sarenrae will guide power or aid to you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Why don't you wait on that.\nLIAM: Well, we either have a 10% chance right now for her to tell us what to do–\nLIAM: Or a 10% chance–\nSAM: To help us later.\nLAURA: Once we know what we're doing.\nASHLEY: Yeah, let's wait until we know what we're doing.\nORION: I believe we should go and rescue the prisoners and build a small army. Moreover, I've been thinking. It all goes downward, correct? He's all up in a pit, yes?\nSAM: The world down here?\nORION: No, the beholder, K'Varn.\nLIAM: He's in the top of a pyramid.\nORION: Up or down?\nLIAM AND TRAVIS: Up.\nORION: Well, that won't help me at all.\nMARISHA: It's his laboratory.\nLAURA: I feel like we should go for the top.\nTRAVIS: How would we free the prisoners, first of all?\nTALIESIN: I think it's that beehive structure.\nLAURA: We have to take out the metal thingy.\nLIAM: It's not letting them out. We have to get them out of K'Varn's control. So how do we do that?\nTALIESIN: I think we destroy the beehive structure at the top.\nLAURA: I think we destroy the structure.\nLIAM: It's the only option that seems open to us, unless we keep stumbling around and looking for some other way, I think.\nLAURA: We don't have any kind of corruption spell that ages things?\nMARISHA: Well, we've got the acid thing, and maybe Grog can–\nLAURA: What if we hit it with Dispel Magic, maybe get your goddess's aid– hit it with Dispel Magic, hit it with corruption, rust the shit, and then it falls!\nSAM: But we don't have corruption.\nLIAM: Can Scanlan mercilessly mock the top of the thing?\nSAM: Oh, I can mock.\nTRAVIS: Eff you, brass cross!\nMARISHA: I like Percy's idea. We've got that acidic vial.\nTALIESIN: We have several vials of acid, actually.\nASHLEY: Can you take the normal acid and could we make it magical?\nLAURA: Like, extra bad? We don't even know what it does yet.\nMARISHA: Well, I can always be an eagle, and I can maybe fly, or maybe Grog could carry a big boulder. That way, after the acid has–\nTALIESIN: I thought about making an acid arrow. I really did.\nMARISHA: He could throw a big boulder to collapse it the rest of the way.\nLIAM: Question. You built a bomb before.\nSAM: That took months.\nLIAM: If we could hole up for– months or weeks, was it?\nLAURA AND SAM: Months.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, it took months.\nTALIESIN: It took me months to figure out how to build.\nLIAM: Now that you know how to build one, would it be quicker?\nMARISHA: Wait, the bomb we just threw in that room?\nTALIESIN: I could make an exploding arrow. I've made one, I can make another.","response":"DM: I would say your materials are very limited."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah. At this point, though, if I had a workshop, I could–\nSAM: Well, let's take Kima's advice and maybe start with a little reconnaissance. We'll get closer, we'll rest for the night, and maybe send in a snooping party.\nLIAM: My sister says that island is crawling with nasty shits.\nLAURA: We can't get closer.\nASHLEY: We should just rest. We'll stay up, because we're good.\nLAURA: What if we fly in over the top with the carpet in stealth, put the camouflage on the carpet so they don't see it. Fly in over the top. Stealth in, spy, get an idea of–\nLIAM: Inspect the top of the building, see where the acid would be put to good use.\nLAURA: Yeah, see what kind of magic is being held on top of it.\nLIAM: We're guessing that K'Varn doesn't want to leave his little cubby-hole.\nTALIESIN: I would assume not.\nLIAM: So even if we fly down on top, he gets pissed, he could fly up, but we could fly away. He probably doesn't want to leave the top of the–\nTALIESIN: There's going to come a point where chaos is just going to descend on us.\nTRAVIS: We're also forgetting that the second that he sees us or we get close enough, he could control all of our minds.\nSAM: Wasn't the point of us going to these beaches to try to see if there was any other advantage we could find?\nLAURA: We were trying to find clues so that maybe scrying could be helpful, which it was.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nLAURA: Okay, here's another option: Dimension Door. What if you go and hug one of the beams and Dimension Door the beam out?\nSAM: I don't think I can do that.\nORION: No.\nSAM: I can banish a being, but not a beam.\nLAURA: You can't cast a portal on the door and make it fall?\nTALIESIN: No, sadly.\nLAURA: Not like Portal?\nLIAM: Well, we've been here, and we've been here.\nSAM: Should we go to one more beach before we all die?\nLIAM: Here, or here, or this little nubbin right here?\nTALIESIN: I was thinking about that.\nLAURA: Those are just more things to fight.\nLIAM: Well, that's true, but my sister studied the island, and she sensed the presence of things everywhere.\nTRAVIS: That sounds awesome. Let's go there.","response":"DM: Clustered mainly in the city region."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: There's no need for us to relocate now.\nLIAM: Well I am curious about this. Can we see this from the beach we're on? What is this?","response":"DM: At this distance, it's hard to make out any sort of visual."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We could camp there. That could be where we stage our attack from.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I like that. Let's go take over a little shanty-town.\nMARISHA: Wait. Why?\nSAM: Because it'll be that much closer tomorrow. We can do reconnaissance from there.\nMARISHA: We can do reconnaissance from where we are.\nSAM: We still have to get across this body of water. You said there's something swimming down there.\nMARISHA: We've got a magic carpet.\nTRAVIS: It'll be a little victory. We'll take over the shanty-town.\nMARISHA: It's literally never been a problem.\nASHLEY: Can we all fit on the magic carpet?\nLAURA AND TRAVIS: No.","response":"DM: Not at once, no."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I can water-walk.\nLIAM: We can also do two trips on the carpet.\nMARISHA: But we're not all going for reconnaissance, are we?\nLAURA: No, stealthy stealth.\nTALIESIN: If something goes wrong, though, it's going to be– I would rather something go wrong with all of us than something go wrong with half of us.\nLIAM: Well, I tell you what. We don't know what to do, so why don't Vex and I and Scanlan go for a little ride and check out the tip of this island?\nASHLEY: I don't want to be split up.\nTRAVIS: I don't, either. Let's take over the shanty-town. Let's at least get on the island.\nSAM AND TALIESIN: Baby steps.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, baby steps.\nMARISHA: Okay, well, then you guys go check it out first.\nTALIESIN: We'll get in the boat and we'll start heading there.\nASHLEY: Are we getting on the boat or doing the carpet?\nTALIESIN: Well, we can't all fit on the carpet.\nLIAM: Let's let Tiberius and the twins and Scanlan fly ahead of the boat, uietly, carefully, see what we see. We have the earrings that Tibber-hoods crafted for us, so we can tell you what we see.\nTALIESIN: Perfect.\nLIAM: And we don't want to rush in. We're probably going to go here, but let's not rush in. Let the quiet ones go have a look.\nLAURA: Just to make sure it's not crawling with baddies.\nMARISHA: Okay. So we'll start boating over.\nLIAM: You need to take it easy for a moment. You just went through some shit, Keyleth.\nASHLEY: You guys are going on the carpet?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to take the boat.\nTRAVIS: I've got a big axe. I'll paddle the boat towards the island.\nMARISHA: Awesome.\nTRAVIS: I've been practicing in the sand to impress Keyleth. Working on the elevator. I haven't figured it out yet, because I don't know what that is.\nLIAM: You know that thing a dog does when it pulls its butt along the floor?\nLAURA: But I could cast Pass Without a Trace so everybody gets +10 to their stealth rolls.\nLIAM: Yeah, that sounds good.\nTRAVIS: So who's in the boat with me?\nSAM: Oh, we're going over? By boat? Is that what's happening?\nTRAVIS: Percy, Keyleth.\nLAURA: Trinket.\nTRAVIS: Pike and Trinket. So we start paddling in the boat.\nLAURA: How about Kima and Clarota? Clarota should go with us.","response":"DM: Clarota can just hover."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can Clarota be on the carpet, then?","response":"DM: You can have him alongside the carpet."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll take Kima.\nLIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: Yeah, Clarota come with us.","response":"DM: So Percy, you're on the boat as well?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm in the boat.\nSAM: Are the rest of us flying? We're flying.\nLIAM: Team Clarence and Team Kima-gibbler.\nTRAVIS: Watch your mouth.\nLAURA: Clarota, I'm sure we've asked this before and I wasn't here because I missed a part of a thing? What about your hat? What does it do? Can you make more of them?\nLIAM: He said no, it would take a while.\nSAM: We did this already.","response":"DM: “I could, but the time required would be months, weeks. \"Not in our timeframe, I believe.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's squid for no.\nLAURA: Try to stealth it. Are we camouflaging the carpet?\nTALIESIN: I'm going to attempt to attach the skin to the bottom of the carpet.","response":"DM: To the bottom of the carpet?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're saving the world, here, people. Let's not twiddle our thumbs for too long.\nTRAVIS: But you're on the boat.\nTALIESIN: Well, before you guys take off. Just going to try and sew it on the corners.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and make a roll."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's better. 16.\nLIAM: Sorry, I did a quick scrying spell and I know that we're 50 shirts away from the total, so keep going. Get your mother a shirt. Keep going.\nSAM: Okay, so we're over the water?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we're already paddling. The boat's going too. We're fucking fast.","response":"DM: So, as Grog's pulling along– make an athletics check, by the way."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh yeah, about to smash you.\nLAURA: And we're stealthing? Ahead?","response":"DM: You guys are–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Being sneaky.\nTRAVIS: It's a 22.\nLAURA: I rolled a natural 20 on stealth.\nTRAVIS: Where's my stealth?\nTALIESIN: You've got Pass Without a Trace also.\nTRAVIS: 19. So 29.","response":"DM: 29 stealth. As you're very carefully breaking the water's surface– Okay, so as you guys make your way across the channel towards the far end of the island, which is the beach that's in view, you see the water disturbed slightly about 200 feet off to the right. Something deep below. You can see bubbles rising up. As you carefully make your way, ever so quiet, across to the beach, you find purchase. Landfall hits you on the other side of the beach, apparently not disturbing whatever lies beneath the surface."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I immediately hop out, pull the boat up just to beach the boat.","response":"DM: Okay, so you pull the boat up. The rest of you guys bring the carpet over. You come to a landing part, totally fine. The beach comes to a steep incline that leads up onto the island proper. There's cliffs on both sides of this beach, and as the incline increases up about maybe 500, 600 feet from where you are, you can see what looks like a few buildings or rubble of what was a small gathering of structures."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we check out the thing in the air?\nLIAM: Is there a larger one behind those smaller structures?\nLAURA: That was it.","response":"DM: What you're seeing now is this."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are there any of those crazy trees you mentioned before?","response":"DM: You do see, towards the right of those structures, those fungal-based trees. They rise about 25, 30 feet in the air. There's no leaves. It's almost like a cluster of weird fungus-like vines that drift from the top surface, and the trees unnaturally sway in place, almost like they have a rhythm to their movement."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Dr. Seuss trees. Not cool.","response":"DM: Really nasty Dr. Seuss trees."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Clarota, will those trees attack us? Are they living and attack-y?","response":"DM: Clarota says, “No, those trees merely exist on this island. They feed off of the essence of it and they provide food for other things that live here.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Like what?\nMARISHA: Trees are bad?","response":"DM: “Wandering spores.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wandering spores?!","response":"DM: “Other creatures.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Other creatures?","response":"DM: “We feed our captives, our slaves of the colony, with the fungal essence of the tree.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Other creatures? Don't skimp on the details, it's only our lives.","response":"DM: “The trees are not dangerous, but whatever resides on this island is probably under the influence of the Elder Brain. And my people, which are in turn under the influence of K'Varn.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But as you're from this island, what wildlife can we expect to run into here?","response":"DM: “Small, sightless rats. Cavern insects. But the dangers lie in the spores that wander the forests.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm picturing a big yellow thing with little legs.\nSAM: Pus.\nLIAM: Fuzzball.\nLAURA: Is that what it is?","response":"DM: “You'll know when you see it.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, that's lovely. Thank you for your help.","response":"DM: “Spiny.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Spiny.","response":"DM: “Drifting.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I take the cask of ale out of the Bag of Holding and pour him a little glass of ale, and I'm like–\nLAURA: Oh, you know what, Grog, I hate to tell you this–\nTRAVIS: It sounds a little scratchy. Would you care for some ale?\nLIAM: It's really good.","response":"DM: It's a psychic discussion. He looks at you and gives you a stern look. Takes the ale from you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Why?","response":"DM: “I have no need for such false sustenance.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Clarota, that was rude.\nTRAVIS: I will not forget that.\nSAM: Can we go inspect those structures up there?\nLIAM: Yes, everyone wait here. I grab Scanlan by the scruff of the neck and nod at my sister.\nSAM: I turn invisible.\nLIAM: Let's go take a peek, yes? We'll take a peek. Just wait a minute.\nTALIESIN: We can wait. That's fine.\nMARISHA: I actually go collect a few of the vines hanging from the trees.\nTALIESIN: General perception check on the beach as well.\nTALIESIN: I don't know why I'm bothering. 11. It's a beach.\nTRAVIS: I rolled 15.\nMARISHA: 16.","response":"DM: 16 on nature? Okay, from a safe distance, you look at it. The trees do not appear to be anything beyond a subterranean forest. Fungal trees."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I wanted to collect some.","response":"DM: Oh, you wanted to go over and collect some? Okay. It's quite a ways up. It's up the side of the cliff. It's up an incline, and the forest starts adjacent to the structure where they're going."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Might want to wait.","response":"DM: So you can make a stealth check to make your way there, if you'd like."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, I'll wait. I thought we were next to a tree.","response":"DM: No, most of the forest starts further up this incline as the island itself begins to level off."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let the scouts scout.\nSAM: Let's go scout it out.\nSAM: So we make our way up to the structure.\nLIAM: 28 for stealth.","response":"DM: 28 for stealth. You get advantage on your roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it our old stealth check? Can I use my flying stealth check? Damn it.\nSAM: Nope.","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Three.","response":"DM: With advantage?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: That was my advantage. The first one was a one.\nLAURA: 31.\nTRAVIS: Holy shit.\nLIAM: Do the twins outweigh him?\nSAM: Wait, plus two! That makes it five.\nLAURA: Plus ten. Pass Without a Trace.\nSAM: Oh, plus ten! That's 15!\nTRAVIS: We're getting better! Plus my inspiration from paddling.","response":"DM: You guys make your way towards this ruin, and as you come to it, you caught a small glimmer of it on the bridge that was constructed across the first beach you came across in this cavern. The stonework is interesting. It's almost like an influx of jade and marble. The stone itself does not seem to be anything you've seen naturally around the cavern; either it was brought here or was crafted from some substance that resides on this island. But it has this weird green jade, marble, almost… vein-like visual to it. And you notice all the structures aren't straight and smooth. Everything has this slightly non-Euclidean bend to it. Every edge has a slight curve. It's off-putting. There isn't a rigidity to any of these walls, and the buildings themselves almost seem to sag, or they sit or rest at a strange, unnatural angle."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: These buildings are sad.","response":"DM: Many have been long-crumbled, and you find some of these buildings have fallen in on themselves. You do notice, as you approach the edge of it, there is a large, circular structure. A pit that is built central to this. Parts of the wall have fallen in, but for the most part still remains intact, and in the center of this pit, on the floor, you can see what looks like splotches of dried crimson, long-left blood splatters of some sort of creature. You see dried bones, but the bones, while dried, have some sort of fungus growing on them. You also see what looks to be, tucked against one of the walls, a campsite. But a very large campsite. The fire pit is 15 feet wide and is just a small cinder. You see what looks to be a pile of furs."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A recent campsite?","response":"DM: There is actual embers in the fire pit. There looks to be a large bedroll made of patchwork furs, but the pile itself is huge."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But it looks twice the size of what I would use for a fire, or what I would use for a bedroll.","response":"DM: Three times, even, which means it houses a lot of individuals."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Or one big thing.\nMARISHA: Or a really big thing.\nLIAM: Giants.\nMARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: As you're taking this look, too, as you guys are having this visual, you–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Question: bigger than Grog?","response":"DM: Well. You immediately hear a sound. It's a slight rumble in the ground and what sounds like a footfall, and as you glance over your shoulder, you can see what looks to be some sort of towering humanoid dragging something behind it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Stealthed.\nLAURA: Oh, should we hide? Can we try to hide?","response":"DM: All of you were stealthed as well."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, yeah. Can I do insight and see if it seems like a bad guy?","response":"DM: You can make an insight check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I know. I'm just checking to see if he's a misunderstood guy.\nTRAVIS: Do I see him? Can I do a simple recognize check?","response":"DM: You don't see him. All you guys are staying back at the beach while they're checking."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Both of you have got earrings.\nLAURA: That's 17.","response":"DM: 17? This entity looks like it's hungry, it looks malicious, and looks like it's caught the thrill of the hunt, since it seems to have seen something near its homestead moving. As it begins to step forward, it drops whatever it's holding behind it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm picking up Scanlan and moving backwards.\nLAURA: Yeah, can we move into the shadows?\nSAM: I'm invisible.\nLIAM: You're right there.\nLAURA: We know where you are.\nLIAM: I was holding your hand the whole time.\nSAM: Okay.","response":"DM: And that is where we're going to leave tonight's session."}
{"prompt":"(all groan)\nTRAVIS: Come on!\nLIAM: Nowhere near K'Varn.\nMARISHA AND TRAVIS: Really?\nLIAM: Nowhere near him.\nORION: No.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: But wait, maybe if we sell out the shirts we can go another half-hour or something.\nMARISHA: Yeah, how many shirts do we have left?\nORION: Like 20 or something like that?\nSAM: Didn't make it. Didn't make it to K'Varn, didn't make it to the shirts.\nLIAM: It's K'Varn!","response":"DM: Hello, everyone! Sorry for the delay; we had a few folks that were in transit, but we're all good. We're all here now, and welcome to a very special episode of Critical Role. We have a number of members of our party that are on vacation this week, so as opposed to continuing a climactic endpoint of a long 11-12 week story arc, we're going to hold off a week and have them return next week to pick up where we left off, just after the battle with the big bad beholder, K'Varn the Mad. However, this week, what we're going to be doing is, essentially, a little workshop. A class, if you will, on Dungeons & Dragons and roleplaying games in general. For those of you out there that have never played before, for those of you who have played and want to pick up some new skills or ideas, and for many who are out there who have either had a hard time dungeon mastering or have been too scared to try being a dungeon master or game master, depending on your roleplaying game of choice, we're going to try to dispel some of that and give some tips and tricks along the way. So, first and foremost, let's go around the table and say hello to everyone who is here. We have Marisha Ray, who plays Keyleth in our usual campaign."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hello!","response":"DM: We have Taliesin, who plays Percy in our campaign."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Greetings. Hello.","response":"DM: We have Orion, who plays Tiberius in our campaign."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Good evening, everyone.","response":"DM: And the birthday boy, Liam O'Brien."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, hi!\nMARISHA: May birthdays for the win.","response":"DM: So we have the support team here from Critical Role to offer suggestions, answer questions, and help these other guys here I'm going to introduce in a second with their character creation for the end of the evening. I'm going to completely improvise on the spot a short game for these fellows, and we'll see how that pans out. For some of them, their first game of D&D. We shall see how that goes. So let's go ahead and introduce on this side of the table. We have Dan Casey."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Hello!\nMARISHA: Dan Casey!\nDAN: How are you doing?\nMARISHA: Dan Casey, everybody. Dan Casey in the house!\nTALIESIN: There we go. Dan Casey.\nMARISHA: Yeah, Dan Casey.","response":"DM: Right over yonder."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hollywood Squares.\nORION: Oh.\nDAN: Circle takes the square! What's up, guys?","response":"DM: What's your experience with roleplaying games?"}
{"prompt":"DAN: I am sort of a lapsed D&D player. I played a lot of 3.5. I played some AD&D back in the day, when I had no idea what the term THAC0 meant, at all. I still don't.","response":"DM: Nobody still, to this day, knows."}
{"prompt":"DAN: It's an eldritch mystery not meant to be known by the likes of men.","response":"DM: Yes, completely agree. Thankfully, that's gone now."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Exactly! Yeah. So I've been playing a little bit recently. I just started a Pathfinder campaign with some friends, so I have a working knowledge, but I'm a little rusty, I would say.","response":"DM: Okay. No worries. We'll try and get you up to speed on that. We have in the middle here, dressed so eloquently, our fantastic overlord, Zac Eubank."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: I am the Snugglelord! There have been none before me and there will be none after. I am the Snugglelord.","response":"DM: It has been decreed, here and now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You killed and skinned a unicorn.\nZAC: You can stop.\nERIKA: Okay.","response":"DM: Our third party member of the newcomers tonight is in transit, as well, and should be here shortly. Should we introduce them or wait until they get here? What do you think?"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: How are you doing, Ify? How's it going, man? Oh, good.\nDAN: Cloak of Invisibility.\nORION: It's called “Giant Penis Jokes.”","response":"DM: There you go. We'll have Ify here shortly. Ify, as I know, plays D&D and knows it pretty well, so we're not losing any speed by continuing without him. To begin now, before we go, we have a few gifts here that came in."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We have more gifts?","response":"DM: I've got here an inflatable Cthulu beard for the dungeon master, so when I feel like going full eldritch horror on you guys, I'll have a nice visual tool to help– I'm wondering if you can eat through it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I kind of think that the idea was so that you can be Clarota.","response":"DM: Right! I'm totally doing that next game."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I kind of think that's what they were going for.","response":"DM: That's true. I should do that now."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: But can you eat through it?\nMARISHA: But can you eat?","response":"DM: I can strain food through it, is what it looks like."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can we blow it up? Can we try it out?","response":"DM: Go for it. Yeah. There are tiny mouth holes that are all segmented, so it'd have to be a fine paste or a liquid bakery item I could push through."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Just pull it forward slightly and pour soup in.\nTALIESIN: It will keep the bay leaf out. That's very useful.","response":"DM: Also, somebody presented this fantastic glittery dragon dungeon master mug that I'm enjoying my delicious beverage out of. So this is delightful, and it's getting all over my hands, so don't question it later. It's the mug. I haven't been out late with strippers."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Uh-huh. Dragon strippers.","response":"DM: Dragon strippers. Those are the most expensive."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: They work for scale.\n(groaning)\nTALIESIN: There you are.","response":"DM: Also, this awesome crocheted beholder bag."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN AND ORION: Oh my god.","response":"DM: As representation of our fantastic boss battle with K'Varn last week. I'm going to find many cool things to put inside of this. Or just wear it when I'm alone at home. And nothing else. It'll be great."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And nothing else?\nMARISHA: That's hot, right?\nMARISHA: Ify!\nIFY: Hey!","response":"DM: There we go! In quotes, “Seriously, what the hell was that screech tonight?” Yeah, sorry about that. R.I.P. ears, I know. “Show everyone what D&D can be. Not everyone is a professional voice actor, but you don't have to be a voice actor. You can make yourself more grandiose and gesture more. Your body language embodies the characters just as much as your voice does, even if you don't realize it. I also have to thank you again for being generous enough to agree to sign the shirt for charity. I'm planning on cutting a loop of highlights to have running for people who might not be aware of Critical Role, but there are so many. Jolene is ecstatic that this will be a part of their auction and I can't tell you how rewarding that single reaction has been for me. I can't wait to see what they're able to raise for charity with it.” So happy we could help with that. “I would ramble on about you guys for a while, but it would merely be the disjointed ramblings of an overtired fan.” That's okay, we're– most of our talk is disjointed ramblings of overtired performers. “Keep doing what you're doing. It is clear that you're all amazing people and are more than welcome to join the Team Hooman Facebook group. Ryon, Felicia, Zac and most of the Twitch hosts are already there and it's generally a cool place to hang out and be supporting of everyone.” We'll check it out. We'll jump on that."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I've joined it already. Team Hooman.\nMARISHA: Thanks, Useless Rogue!","response":"DM: It's amazing. Thank you so much."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thanks, Scott.\nZAC: Cool. I'm gonna poop-caboose that.","response":"DM: Do it!"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: And be like: Hey, guys, don't forget to subscribe. We're like seven or eight subscribers away from giving away a signed photo of the Critical Role cast and a signed Player's Handbook, because that gets us at 3,150. Another 50 after that and we'll do the giveaway all over again. So get that Sub Train going.\nIFY: I love that since you found a name for it you call it out.\nORION: Ify.\nIFY: How's it going, Orion? Yo, I'm about to coop-wibba-coop-wib…coop poop. Coop-caboose.\nZAC: Nope. Nope.\nZAC: Nope! Nope!","response":"DM: (Bill Cosby voice) Y'see, have the poop in da caboose and then it's overdone, y'see."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Too soon, too soon.\nTALIESIN: Way too soon. That just conjured up some bad–","response":"DM: I know. I know, I'm sorry. Hey-oh. So, introduce yourself! Ify, what you got?"}
{"prompt":"IFY: Hey hey, I'm Ify Nwadiwe. You guys know me from Mulligan. Also, do stand-up comedy, acting and, y'know, kissing Zac's hands.\nZAC: You don't have– They didn't see that; they didn't know, and–\nDAN: Nature's moisturizer.\nLIAM: Well-roleplayed, well-roleplayed.\nDAN: That's alarming.","response":"DM: That is a gift that will haunt you for the rest of your days, Zac."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: I didn't realize that by putting on this costume I was going to be inviting such behavior.\nORION: What, the Snugglelord?\nZAC: Yeah.\nORION: You didn't think that would…\nZAC: I didn't think it through, obviously.","response":"DM: Obviously."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You get to make a wish if you touch the horn.\nLIAM: Brings out your eyes.\nMARISHA: I was gonna make a, “He was asking for it,” joke, but I feel like–","response":"DM: Yeah, no."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Maybe, y'know– Maybe just– I mean, you kinda did.\nDAN: Just took the long way around.\nMARISHA: Took the long way around.","response":"DM: It is also the birthday of our fantastic half-elven ranger, Laura Bailey, who plays Vex in the show. The reason that their characters are twins is because they actually share a birthday and they created it that way, so that was kind of a cool little point there. But she's off with her husband in Greece having great vacation times or whatever. Pfft."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Boring.\nORION: Wait. Oh, they went to the country, Greece.\nTALIESIN: I thought they went to the show.\nLIAM: They are seeing Greece. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. North Hollywood.\nMARISHA: No, I don't think anyone does that anymore. Like, goes, y'know–\nORION: Well, I don't know. They might have interests I'm not aware of. Just saying.\nZAC: Let's learn!","response":"DM: So, we're gonna start here with a little overview of character creation. So, for most RPGs, especially those in the fantasy realm, this will be a very familiar aspect where there are many different game types that run different things, but usually the point goes you choose a race and you choose a class. The race defines your physical background, your family bloodline and what attributes that adds to you. A class is essentially the job or the way you've lived your life going forward and what skills you've acquired because of it. So, throughout the Player's Handbook– you can go ahead and turn through the first few pages; first couple sections. You'll see there are certain races like the dwarf, whom I love. Dwarves are awesome. Underrepresented."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: If everyone can turn to page 62 in the Player's Handbook.","response":"DM: Exactly. It's in the Player's Handbook, my good man"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Technically, page 18. Page 18.\nMARISHA: We haven't!\nTALIESIN: We had half a drow.","response":"DM: Stitch monster was elven, not drow."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, I thought it was a drow.\nLIAM: They're mostly bad. Most are bad.","response":"DM: Yeah. So, there are also halflings, which, you could say hobbit, but I think the Dungeons & Dragons version of halflings are a little more awesome, butt-kicking, a little less, “I just want to stay home and make little farm animals.”"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: We found what Lucas is. Short.\nMARISHA: Short?","response":"DM: We got humans, which are cool and well-rounded, all across the board. You got dragonborn, which have dragon bloodlines, like Tiberius over here. Get like a breath weapon. Get really strong, charismatic. You have gnomes, which we have two gnomes in our campaign. They're the smallest of all the races. They're also probably the most nimble and the most naturally resistant against magic types, so they can–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Are they the shortest?","response":"DM: They are the shortest. Yes. Shorter than dwarves and halflings. You also have half-elves, which we have quite a few in our campaign."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Represent!","response":"DM: Happened through some drunken evening between a human and an elf."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Sick.","response":"DM: Get a little bit of both sides. Then you have the half-orc, which is half-human, half-orc. Generally a much larger, stronger, quicker to anger, ready for battle type. And then you have the tieflings, who are humanoid but have somewhere in their previous bloodline some contact with demonic forces that left them with some essence of the Hells in their bloodlines. Like horns, tails, yellow eyes– Think Nightcrawler from X-Men, that's kind of what a tiefling would look like. Possibly with horns. So those are the races! So if you have some ideas, keep that in the back of your mind, and write down on your sheet what you think would be a cool race."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I think a new one is the djinn. Like there's like a djinn race, like there's an air, a water, and a fire and earth elemental– Like a half human and yeah–\nDAN: Whoa, like an evil genie?","response":"DM: That's cool."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I think the new expansion, like djinns, however you say it.","response":"DM: And of course, we also have the goliaths, which are half-giants. We're not going to be working with that tonight, 'cause those were in the new Elemental Evil edition. That's what Grog is. They're big, strong guys. So keep in mind the race you want to play, which is cool. Classes we got! So, we got barbarian. Grog is a great example of a barbarian. Big, hearty, warrior types that shun armor for just pure aggression and anger. They use rage as a means of destroying their  foes, upping their abilities in combat and preventing mental effects magically affecting them. We have bards. Bards are vastly skilled across the board. They have skills of all types, even things they don't know very well; they know a little bit of everything, kind of a jack of all trades. They have some minor spellcasting. They also can inspire other people with songs, speech and help them out with certain skill checks. Bards are pretty cool. We got clerics. Your healers. But you say healer, you're like, “I don't want to be a healer.” Clerics also have access to really powerful divine magic, so while people may be, “Oh, Clerics are dumb, you heal the party,” they can also call down divine judgment, which is great."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Also, having a healer is really nice. Yeah. Nice being able to have a healer.\nTALIESIN: The hell, dude? Yeah, we should've just worn the same shirt.","response":"DM: But don't feel like you have to. This is a one-shot. You guys can pick whatever you want. We got druids, which do–"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Thanks, man. C'mon.","response":"DM: Hey. First time in the game! Done."}
{"prompt":"DAN: I take the physical challenge.","response":"DM: Physical challenge, physical challenge. Druids also have some healing capabilities. They also have more nature-based magics. They're cool and they control nature. And can turn into beasts, and creatures like that. Keyleth is a druid."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Giant scorpions.","response":"DM: Indeed. We have fighters! Fighters are just straight-up fighters. Imagine what a fighter is. That's a fighter. They can use all armor and all weapons. They can generally get more attacks than other classes. They're generally like the marshal, the generals, the warriors, the pit fighters. They're just more rough and tumble, let's just damage each other. We've got monks! Monks. Crazy fast. Punch and do awesome damage with their bare fists. They can avoid things; they can do multiple hits per round; they can use ki points to inflict different types of attacks. Monks are basically: if you wanna be Ip Man in the middle of a D&D campaign, pick a monk."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I believe like the monk and sorcerer are the only ones that have like the point system?","response":"DM: Yeah. We have paladins. Bastion of good and right in the world, paladins stand for law and wonder, and if anyone proves themselves evil they will be destroyed and smited by the divine energies of their god. So, they're generally pretty pious; they fight for good; they fight for the underdog; they can– like a fight–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just saw Zac perk up there.\nZAC: Yeah.","response":"DM: They have good fighting abilities. They can wear and use most armor and weapons, but they also get a little bit of divine cleric-based magic and they can heal with a touch."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Total boy scouts.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Total boy scouts.","response":"DM: We got rangers, which is what Laura's character, Vex'ahlia, is. They have good either two-weapon or ranged combat. They can pick a companion animal if they want to, that's how Trinket came about. Y'know, definitely the Legolas of Lord of the Rings type. Arrow, arrow, arrow, everything's getting arrows. Arrow'd! And they got rogues, which is what Liam plays in our game. Rogues are all about stealth, stabbing in the back, finding weak points of their enemies and doing serious damage with precision strikes by distracting their enemies and finding where their weak points are. They generally don't have a lot of hit points or defenses, but if they can get in there sneakily, they'll do some serious damage. Then we got sorcerer, which Tiberius is, which is a magical caster, arcane-based. Whereas a wizard is more of like the classic wizard you see with giant spell books– learning and, y'know, Harry Potter-style classes and that kind of learned magical ability– sorcerers have it innately in their blood from their bloodlines somehow. And their casting ability is kind of like an improvised thing they just learned and are good at, so imagine more of a less-learned, less-controlled wizard that mostly understands some magic naturally. Whereas the wizard is the, y'know, the well-learned spell book type; more studious; have a larger breadth of spells to pick from. But the sorcerer's a little more improvised and can use points to instill power with it. Last but not least, we got a warlock. Warlocks are magical practitioners who draw their magic from making a pact with some otherworldly  entity. It can be like demons or the Nine Hells and they draw more hellfire and infernal-type magics. They can make a pact with dark fey, which are basically like creepy Oberon-style, y'know, fairy elf people from A Midsummer Night's Dream; or the Great Old Ones, like Cthulhu. Hi, Cthulhu, give me magic. What could possibly go wrong? Those are warlocks. So those are primarily your classes you get to pick. You choose a race and you choose a class. You guys have some ideas yet of what you might want to play tonight?"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Oh, most definitely. Yeah.\nIFY: Oh yeah.\nDAN: Oh, a hundred percent.","response":"DM: Well, what do you want to play? Let's start with Dan. Dan, what do you want to play?"}
{"prompt":"DAN: I'm going to be a dwarven rogue. Yeah. Rogue tumbler. Not the block.\nZAC: I am the Snugglelord. I am a warlock tiefling. And I derive my powers from all holy overlord of Geek and Sundry. The evil overlord.","response":"DM: Okay. That would fall under Infernal. Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: This is feeling really meta.\nZAC: No.","response":"DM: Yeah, I'm gonna say that that most definitively falls under the Fiend Pact. Yup. So you're in a fiend pact. And then, what do you got, Ify?"}
{"prompt":"IFY: Ha! I'mma be Ulfgar Fireforge. Fighter. Dwarf. Two-handed swordsman. Cut your face off. Take your money.\nIFY: a.k.a. True Neutral.\nMARISHA: True Neutral! Do it!","response":"DM: This is gonna be a very fun, short game."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: We got this! What are you talking about?\nDAN: Never made it out of that first tavern.","response":"DM: Aw, man, you guys–"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: I set the place on fire.","response":"DM: Wait, we're not there yet! We're not there yet! Hold it– Hold it back, hold it back! Cool. So, for each of you guys, let's go ahead and roll up some stats for you. So what you do to decide what your attributes are for your characters, that basically says how strong they are; how hearty their physicality is; how fast they are. And you have strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma. Those are the six stats. So, for you guys, if you want to go ahead and take– There are different ways of rolling stats. Some people do a point-buy system where you start with a certain base stat and you can buy based on points. For this, we're gonna use my favorite system to do, which is you roll 4d6–"}
{"prompt":"IFY: Oh, my favorite, too.","response":"DM: Drop the lowest. Arrange as desired. So I guess for those of you who haven't seen how the dice work, there are different dice values in the game. You have a d4, which is a four-sider dice. So it's the little caltrop. Painful to step on. You got a d6, your typical six-sided dice; d8, which is a little more pointy, that's an eight-sider. You got a ten-sider, which comes in two varieties: regular or additional numbers– this is if you're doing percentage rolls, you know what the percentile dice numbers are. Pardon me. A d12, which is only really used if you're a barbarian, apparently. It's the saddest and the red-headed stepchild of D&D."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I use a d12.","response":"DM: Oh yeah, that's right, you use it, too! It's great. I'm happy. It needs more love, it needs more love. d12 needs more love. And the d20, which is the most-used dice in the game. Most all decisions are based on a 20-sided dice. We'll get into that in a little bit. So, for the statistics, I need you guys to go ahead and take 4d6– so four six-sided dice. We'll start– whoever wants to start, go ahead and you–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I have the four– those four right up front.\nZAC: Right up front?\nMARISHA: There you are.","response":"DM: You roll them, drop the lowest number–"}
{"prompt":"DAN: Yahtzee.","response":"DM: Starting with a seven! Awesome."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Yeah! Big sev'!\nMARISHA: Woo!","response":"DM: So, you can decide where you want to put your seven, in any of those stats."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: If your stats are super crappy, we'll roll again.","response":"DM: No, we won't."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, we won't. Not tonight. Never mind. But normally if your stats are super crappy–\nDAN: It's not that kind of campaign! No, play it where it lies.","response":"DM: You can put it wherever you want to. Ten is an average score. An average person has a ten."}
{"prompt":"DAN: So C-.\nMARISHA: What we generally do is roll all six and then write them down, and then decide where you want them. Okay.","response":"DM: What you got over there?"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: I have 15 on my first one.\nIFY: Eight!","response":"DM: Ooh! Nice. 15 and eight. What you got, Dan?"}
{"prompt":"IFY: Oh. Sorry, that counts as a six.\nDAN: Oh, there we go! Big 13. Big 13 in the house.\nIFY: So that was– I'm sorry. Correction: 14, was that.\nIFY: Apparently, this was from a wild western and they have a bull's head as a six instead of a–\nZAC: Five times, okay.","response":"DM: Okay, so roll five times, and then everyone, for the purposes of this game–"}
{"prompt":"DAN: Oh, finally. 17.","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Ooh!","response":"DM: You can put it anywhere you want."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Why, thank you, good sir.","response":"DM: I figure for this, that way if anyone just rolls crappy, then they're not doing too bad."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Get that seven, for a bit of character.","response":"DM: Dude. Lower stats are some of my favorites. Like, honestly, having something lower than ten, at least one, is great. That's how Grog got his intelligence to six, Tiberius's wisdom of four. Like, those are great defining characteristics of a character, so–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah. I generally have a charisma of eight, but I have that circlet which is boosting me.\nMARISHA: Which just makes me average. Right.\nLIAM: Everyone's gonna play this game the way they want to, but I think if you're playing it for like the numbers and maxing out your numbers, and the like, “How can I deal the most damage,” when you're picking your skills, it's less fun, Like, choose the things that draw you to it as a character or personality or– Be really weak with powerful magic or be totally musclebound like Grog with a– and be a, y'know, an idiot.\nORION: That's why Tiberius is so bumbly sometimes and really doesn't know shit. It's his first time out in the world–\nDAN: Unless you're super into math, which I'm not.","response":"DM: But go math."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Yeah, if that's your bag, do it.","response":"DM: Cool. So, once you have your stats arranged, from that point you can start going to your characters. And we're gonna go ahead and just make level two characters. Relatively simple. For this first game. If you look to where your classes are it'll have a hit point value, as well, and we're gonna roll how many hit points you have. Everyone starts with, at level one, max hit point value. And I think, let's see, for the rogue, we have a d8. So you start at eight hit points."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Oh, boy, I'm gonna roll again?","response":"DM: And you roll 1d8 to add to that for level two."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Two!\nDAN: A hot ten. Double digits. Don't like to brag.","response":"DM: Now, what's your constitution?"}
{"prompt":"DAN: Oh, that will– I haven't assigned them yet.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"DAN: But– 'Cause I wanted to– I know as a dwarf, I get plus two to my constitution. Correct?","response":"DM: True. Exactly. Yup."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Okay.\nMARISHA: Yeah, you get certain racial stat bonuses depending on what race you choose.","response":"DM: Yeah. Yeah, what we'll do is we'll do a couple of choosing things and then I'll have you guys go over and help them with actually building the minutia of the characters while I go over the Dungeon Master section of this."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nLIAM: You had to bring race into it.","response":"DM: I do. I know. Cool, so to just get the hit point roll out of the way, too, for you, Zac."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Cool, so it's a d8?","response":"DM: As a warlock, you are– (sings) you are rolling! A d8, as well. So you start with eight and then add this to it."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Eight.","response":"DM: Cool. 16."}
{"prompt":"IFY: Nice. Good roll.","response":"DM: And you got a d10."}
{"prompt":"IFY: Ten. Ten, and then imma add five.","response":"DM: 15 on you. The warlock has the most hit points."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, let's do this.\nLIAM: Okay. You're gonna chat, while we–?","response":"DM: Yup."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Great.","response":"DM: Keep it a little quiet. We're gonna turn those mics down over there. We're gonna keep on mine and I'm gonna go ahead and go over more of the actual Dungeon Mastering–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Who wants to pick who for their coach?\nZAC: I need all the help in the world.\nMARISHA: Do we have like individual coaches?\nZAC: Who wants to be really disappointed at the end of the night?\nLIAM: Me, me, me!\nZAC: Okay, help me!\nORION: Which one of you is a caster? What are you, Ify?\nIFY: I'm a fighter, so–\nYou're also to rationalize the world around them. So– If we can keep the volume down just a little bit, guys. It's all good, it's all good. It's all good. So, rationalizing the world around them. Now, what I say about that is, when they encounter NPCs– which is a non-player character, anyone that's not controlled by the players– and they have a conversation or they do something in front of them, that non-player character's gonna have a reaction. So you as the Dungeon Master, or Game Master, you decide based on what they've done or what they've said, the personality of the character that you're playing, how they would react to that circumstance. Favorably, unfavorably. And so a lot of your experience as Dungeon Master is rationalizing that relationship back and forth. If they're a really charismatic character that comes, reads the NPC well and kinda sees that maybe– “They dress well, maybe they like a lot of money,” and so they open the conversation about money and how they can be paid. That's gonna be a very favorable reaction, so if they're trying to convince the NPC to do something, you might consider a relatively low difficulty. If it's a progressive conversation and the player keeps bungling their words or rolling poorly throughout the conversation, that difficulty might get higher and higher by the end of the conversation for them to finally convince them to do something. So, you're constantly gauging how well they're doing in a social encounter versus how easy it is for the NPC to believe what they're saying.\nAlso, you'll find challenges that are conflicting or versus, where the player rolls versus an NPC. An example of that would be someone trying to deceive somebody, to lie to somebody, versus their insight. And so what you'd do is the player, if they're trying to lie to an NPC, they'd go ahead and roll, add their deception skill and then me as the Dungeon Master, or you as the Dungeon Master, would roll a d20, add that NPC's insight skill– and if you haven't decided one, you can make one up on the spot based on how insightful that kinda NPC might be– and compare the two. If they lose, they'd probably believe the player. If they win, they don't and it's your decision whether or not they wanna show that card or go along with it, secretly knowing that they were lying and then have that bite them in the ass later on. So you wanna be a fair judge, and rationalize the world around them and how NPCs react to what they're doing.\nAlso, in that same vein, you want to reward good thinking, guile, and good in-character actions and roleplaying, and punish reckless, against-character behavior. A good example was Pike, as a cleric, early in the game she was, y'know, beginning to be a little cruel and, y'know, while she is a war cleric, and combat and battle is not unfamiliar to her, cruelty was, and unnecessary cruelty began to fall into a negative point of favor with her deity, Sarenrae, causing the holy symbol to begin to crack and we're kinda seeing where that's gonna play out down the road.  Conversely, if someone does something really cool in-character or something that really kind of changes the dynamic or has everyone else at the table going like, “Whoa,” that's really great and maybe you want to reward them with an inspiration dice, which is– if you guys have seen the inspiration mechanics– you can lend inspiration dice to players, which allows them to give a bonus to one of the rolls they make. Our bard, Scanlan, can give those out as an ability, but you as the DM can also give those out if somebody does something really cool. And if someone does something really risky, but really crazy dynamic, even if it seems near-impossible, let them try, let the players try things that are crazy. They \nmight have a really low chance of working and they'll fail spectacularly, and those will still make for great stories and great memories in that game. So, y'know, let the players be heroes, present them with challenges, reward them for good in-character decisions, and try and detract them from making out-of-character decisions that take and rob the fun from the other players, as well. I mean, everyone can play as they want to. If you're running an evil campaign or you have an evil character in a game that's, like, starting to undermine the rest of the party, that can be interesting as long as all the players understand and are down with that type of experience. Once again, that's the conversation you have at the beginning about what everyone's trying to get out of the game.\nSo as a Dungeon Master, you want to be a fair judge; you want to rationalize the world around them; you want to try and make sure the players have the opportunity to be heroes and have those heroic moments; reward them for doing good, cool things; try and detract them from ruining other people's fun or doing things that are out of character; and build a world for them to play in. So, in these books, and in any RPG book, there are many rules about how to do combat, how to do social interactions, and you can read up on that. You can take a look at what's in there and, understand, you can play these by the book, completely as they are inside, and it's a great rule system, it works really well. But everything in here, in all these books, are guidelines. Anything can be changed, anything can be altered, anything can be customized to how you want it to be. If you don't like how movement or actions work in the game, you can change it however you see fit– and just notify the players that's the case, of course, otherwise they might feel a little, y'know, taken advantage of if they don't understand the changes you've made–  but, you can change and alter anything you want in the game. It's just guidelines for you to play off of. I know I've homebrewed a few things and occasionally aspects of being used to Pathfinder bleed over as well, but you just take it as it comes.\nThe bottom line is, as a Dungeon Master or as a Game Master, it's your world and you can– your word is law. People can't really argue with you unless it's a rules question that you didn't clarify before, in which case you kinda have to go in the favor of the player if it's something you didn't clarify, but for the most part you play the part of the overall god of this world and the players also have to respect that what you say goes. That's kinda that weird dynamic between the players and the DM, it's kinda– it's a respect mechanic, you don't want the players to lose respect for you because then they stop– well, partially enjoying it, but also they start feeling that antagonistic relationship which can be a little stressful for both points. So, customize the rules as you see fit. We homebrewed Percy's gunslinger class over from Pathfinder, because we just– when we converted over, there was no equivalent and so we made something up, and we're trying it out, it's a work-in-progress, it's by no means perfect but it seems to be doing okay and it keeps it fun for him without completely changing the dynamic of the character he already created. I know they'll probably release a gunslinger equivalent in the future or something and it might be vastly different from what he has, but we're gonna stick with this because it's what he's used to and it's what he's built his character's personality and combat around. So yeah, just keep that in mind.\nThe next bit, and this is kind of a big suggestion point for a lot of you guys. A large part of the DM's time is spent worldbuilding. I say worldbuilding, it's creating all the little details and the aspects of the world you want the players to play in. There are parts that, like, creating a society, building towns and villages, designing dungeons and encounters, all that crazy stuff all comes together into that world that you're creating. Shh shh shh shh shh shh shh. Thank you. We have to keep everything down a little bit. But you want to start somewhere and it seems very daunting as a Dungeon Master, especially a new one, to say, “How do I– How do I create all this– How do I– Where do I start?” And that's a difficult question. Sometimes, for your first couple games, it doesn't hurt to look at a module, go out and pick up one of the existing Dungeons & Dragons adventure books that outlines for you how a city would be built, how NPCs would be built, and how they would play out and respond to certain circumstances. It's a good way to train yourself to see how that process would look when it's finished, so if you decide to create your own campaign or customize aspects you know where to build off of.\nORION: Are you gonna do the backgrounds for them?","response":"DM: We'll get to that when you finish all the rest of the stuff."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We're doing backgrounds now.","response":"DM: Well, you can do your backgrounds on your way, then. We'll go through it. It's fine."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, but do it. Do the background–\nIf they're persuading well or, if persuasion doesn't work, you can intimidate the information out of somebody in which they scare someone enough to eventually give up a name, and they'll say, “Edge. Edge is the one you want to talk to.” When they ask around and start finding more information about Edge, they could decide to infiltrate the thieves' guild and find her personally. That might be a little aggressive and you consider, “If a person breaks into a thieves' guild, the thieves' guild will take that as a sign of aggression and will probably meet them with battle.” If they instead try and find a member of the thieves' guild and parley with them, they could persuade them to speak to Edge on their behalf, in which case they might actually have the opportunity of speaking with her one-to-one in a not-quite-as-aggressive circumstance. It can go any which way and that's kind of the– The interesting part of being a Dungeon Master is you never know what the players are gonna do. You set up these characters, you set up this world and you kinda let them play, and all you're doing is reacting to everything they do, rationalizing how the world would react to what they're doing.\nSo, let's say the players are like, okay, they asked around, they found somebody who did some work with the thieves' guild, they intimidated some information out of them about Edge; you then find somebody you think may be associated with the thieves' guild and you pay them a lot of money and persuade them to go ahead and  speak to Edge on their behalf, asking that she would meet with you at this inn at this time. Your party then goes to that inn room and waits for a while. Over a short period of time, it seems like she's not gonna show up, based on how you think she would react to that experience. I'd say she's curious enough that someone sought her out that she would want to hear what they have to say, 'cause there might be money in it. Let's say the party has gained some renown in the local village, perhaps she wants to align herself with these upcoming adventurers, there's always money to be gained there. So you have her knock on the door. As the party enters the door, there's nobody there, but at that same moment they hear the sliding of glass, turn around, notice that she slipped in through the back window and is now leaning against the back wall with her arms crossed, waiting expectantly for them to start the conversation since they so openly sought her existence.\nSo now they're in a conversation with Edge. You can decide how to play their personality. If you want her to be as charismatic as you said before, she would bow deeply; you could say that she was happy to introduce herself and, while hearing some things about the party, she's eager to understand what it is they might have to do with her. Let the party explain now what it is that they want from her. Then you decide: does it fall within the respect and money she wants? She could tell them, “I'll help you with this circumstance, as long as you pay me this much.” Or, conversely, “I'll help you with this, as long as you can talk to so-and-so in the town and get them to drop this bounty on my head.” Y'know? You think of what things would fall into her wants and needs the party could do for her and in turn could help them. However, if they've talked around the town, they may notice that she has demonic lineage, and they might bring it up in conversation and see her reaction. She might be very good at hiding that aspect. She might be able to, y'know, to say, “Well, yes, I'm a tiefling indeed, but, y'know, that is not of my own doing.” The players could then go, “Huh. She seems uncomfortable. I'm gonna roll an insight check on this,” then roll an insight check– they roll a d20, adding their insight skill. The DM then, you, privately would go ahead and roll a deception roll, or a persuasion roll depending on what you thought was the circumstance for that, versus their roll and let them know what they read off of her awkwardness. If they roll really low, you'd be like, “She just seems put off by the fact that you've never seen a tiefling.” If they roll really well, you could tell them that at the notion of tiefling and demonic blood, she fidgets and looks over her shoulder, seemingly like she's afraid something's following her. Then the party can press her in that regard, and begin to say things like, “Well, if you aren't gonna help us, we have a warlock friend who does dealings with the infernal and we know your name now. If there's someone chasing you, y'know, we could call them on you unless you help us.” Now it becomes– as opposed to a persuasion, it becomes an intimidation-based experience; and if they can manage to convince her to help out of sheer intimidation and fearing for what she doesn't want to happen, she becomes an ally, although a much more tenuous relationship.\nSo that's an NPC that I just made up right now and fleshed out. But really, the basis you need for an NPC, to build off any of those circumstances, is: a name, a race and class, what they want, what they fear. Those are some of the biggest things you need to– everything else can be improvised on the spot. Like I said, it's all reactionary as a DM, which is great, because once you set the world, the players drive the story, and you just react off what they're doing and rationalize how the world would react to it. I understand this is a lot of information up front, but I'm trying to get as much information into this talk as I can 'cause we have a limited time and I've had a lot of questions today I'm trying to get through for you guys. So I hope this has been helpful. We'll get to questions in a second so I can answer things specifically to you.\nSo that's an NPC you can create. You can create the same way for like a local cleric, a barkeep. You could be like, his race, he could be a dwarven barkeep. He's not even a fighter; or maybe he once was a fighter, but he gave up the life, used his winnings in some sort of a brawling ring when he was younger to buy this tavern, and that's all he really does, but he's well-connected and has information. What are his wants? He wants money, but he also wants to possibly purchase a tavern across the town that is failing that he thinks could expand his business. What does he fear? Being closed down, or possibly getting arrested because of maybe some things he did in his past that are a little shady that he hoped nobody would remember. So now, when someone talks to that innkeep, there are many different ways they could take that conversation, and many different little ideas you might have as gives as to what they're seeking and what they're afraid of. And those are just cool little notes you make to yourself down the road that if they ever decide to enter that tavern and talk to that NPC, you look down and you immediately know where they stand, what they want, what they don't want and how they can help or hinder the NPC– or the players based on what they do.\nSo that's building a very small town and a small NPC. You flesh out a couple and then you build off from there. And it takes some time, y'know? You can crank out a few NPCs; and you can railroad it as much as you want to. If you don't want to spend a lot of time building a big sandbox game for all your players, you can play a pretty standard, straightforward story. You can decide the players are gonna go to this tavern; the players are gonna go to this, y'know, this home here; they're gonna go to this one mercantile– this kind of textile warehouse where they're gonna find a hidden underground passage that leads to an altar to some forgotten god. In which case you can decide, no matter what happens, you can send the players– let them wander a bit and have fun, but let them know very early in, “You hear that there is some shaky business going on in this town. People in the tavern are whispering about these murders that have been happening in the village. You're like, 'Huh?'” They'll start asking about the murders and that's when you can point them towards, “Well, we've only heard, y'know, that these people have been being killed when passing around this part of town; and they arrested one man last week, but he was let go from the suspicions and he lives at\nthis house.” Now the players will be like, “Oh, well we have to go talk to the guy at that house.” You lead them to that house. They go talk to the guy. The guy might be like, “I don't know what you're talking about.” You press him for information, you find out that he used to work for this textile business and he– Eventually you can either drive that he helped with these murders or that he knows who is and they work with this mercantile. Then, now you send them straight to this warehouse that contains all this, y'know, cloth and textile woodwork-type materials. They might break inside, search the place, find nothing, but if they roll well enough they'll find the trapdoor that leads down into the altar.\nSo those are some guidelines for like a small village. The factions are fun to create, because you can have factions that are allied, factions that are enemies, and that automatically leads in a really cool idea for some story hooks where you have maybe a thieves' guild has a huge rivalry with the mages' academy. One believes that, you know, shadows is a real way to get business done in the local politics whereas the mages feel that it's more arcane understanding that both socio-political aspects can be controlled by the arcane. Maybe you have one played against the others. The players can choose a faction to align with and there's a whole quest line that way. But now they've made enemies with the opposite faction and now they're having to steer clear of their side. Or they can try and double-agent for both but if that ends up going horribly awry they have now earned the anger of both sides and might have to flee the town and never return. So these are all different cool ways that you can set up faction versus faction or factions working together to give the players story and investment in the world that you are creating.\nNow, from that small town, you can build an even larger city. Meaning all those same elements I discussed you just expand upon. You build more NPCs. You build an entire district that is shops and stores, maybe in a giant bazaar. You can create a whole district that is just about worship of different gods and deities, and you have different temples assigned to each god and you can find, you can use the gods that are in the book. You can create your own gods that have their own backgrounds and specialties and guiding principles and religions around that. It's up to you. But as you build a larger city, you have to consider how many different people and cultures it's now having to house and facilitate. So it's a little more of a time investment to build a city that much larger, but it's a really cool experience to then have the players wander through that, to continue to discover. Like, the main city of Emon, which you guys have heard about a little bit of, but I'm sure we'll come back to soon in the campaign, you guys will have the opportunity to see it in person, is a vast city. Much like the classic Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter, it's the central capital city of this entire region and they've only maybe experienced a fifth of it after a whole almost entire year of exploring it, so there are a lot of examples of that urban expansion that they can go through. And to be perfectly honest I've detailed and fleshed out maybe about a third of the village with loose notes for all the rest. So if suddenly one of the players veered right again and decided to go all the way to the far northern slums, which I have nothing really specifically planned for, I can look through my notes and find out a handful of NPCs and some loose story elements that I made notes of about those northern slums and I can kind of improvise based on those notes and where they want to go in the story to still make it a fleshed out story, and if it's a really heavy story thread that they're following I can just find a way to tie it back into the original thread I was trying to tell, and not necessarily guide them back on the path, but have it still fold into the same story they've been discovering. You never quite know where they're gonna take you.\nSo we talked about urban environments. We've talked about cities a bit, you know, which, in those cities you want to also be mindful of what ruling class there is. Is it an oligarchy? Is it a lordship? Is it a kingdom? Is there an elected official? Is it a township? And that political structure will also be a very, very good way to build those factions below it as well. So the larger your city is, the more elements of that social structure you have to consider and how many layers there are beneath it. Is it a very wealthy city universally? Is there a very, very, you know, high disparity between the upper class and the lower class? These are all really cool ways to flesh it out and give you ideas on where NPCs can be and where tension is in that society. Also remember, just because you're in a city doesn't mean there aren't dungeons. Castles and keeps have dungeons. Some cities are built on the ruins of older, older cities that may have underground cavern networks that have been long forgotten or tombs that haven't been touched in years since a strange wave of necromantic energy began to rise things from the grave and they just seal it off. But who knows what lurks beneath there. Or, like earlier at that tavern I told you about that had a strange sinkhole, that's a really cool story arc to lead into an underground cavern network to something that may have caused the sinkhole. Something long forgotten beneath that inn that now threatens the inn or possibly the town its entire self. You know, don't be afraid to have players in a city environment still find creepy, interesting, weird terrain within that city environment.\nIn Emon the players managed to fall through a cistern into a deep, dark underground cavern network that led them through an ancient ruined city, finding a hag that managed to make a proposition with them, whereas for information leading them out she took a bit of Tiberius' luck– he still doesn't know what that means and it still floats above his head. I think he's forgotten about it, but a portion of his fortune has been stolen by this hag, it still resides in that realm. So, urban environments can be urban but don't be afraid to explore avenues above and below. How you doing? How we doing?\nMARISHA: Pretty good.","response":"DM: Cool bit. I'm gonna finish up here real fast with some other ideas. So those are cities. Those are towns. What makes them so special is, in the D&D world, and in a lot of RPG worlds, outside of those bastions of civilization is a very dangerous world. And you can change that up however you see fit, but I find that it definitely makes for a better environment if the players understand that in the wild you find things that are wild. There are creatures that roam free. There are monsters and beasts that call these places home and need to eat and survive. There are intelligent entities that are building their own civilizations in the darkest depths of the mountains or in the shadowed patches of the local forests and going outside of a town, most traveling caravans need to have muscled support hired to come along the way. If you travel alone there is always the possibility of bandits ransacking you on the road or some sort of large hulking beast comes tumbling out of a nearby cavern structure and attacking the, you know, the people. There's so many different ways that you can incorporate a dangerous, wild world around these bastions of society, these little points of light, that makes the game feel more dangerous. It heightens the stakes for the players whenever they have to travel, and it makes returning to a town that much more of a breath of fresh air."}
{"prompt":"I'm gonna cruise through a couple of points here for you guys, so we can start getting to these guys to playing here. Or any questions they have for the story. Story hooks. Story hooks are essentially what gets the players to start seeking the story, and there's a lot of great examples in the Dungeon Master's Guide here, if you guys pick up a copy, that explains a lot of different ideals of how you can get the players invested in your story. Let's see if I can find it real fast back here, but essentially a story hook could be when they enter a tavern they notice that someone in the corner is hunched over and eventually falls forward off their stool. The party goes and inspects and finds out that they've been stabbed and are bleeding out, and in their dying words they reach up to the player. They whisper a name, like, oh shit, what is that name? What does that mean? And someone in the room is like, that name, that's the name of the leader of this one temple of Pelor, the God of the Sun, the God of Light. Okay, well, the players now have the idea that someone got murdered and their last words were the name of this person. Let's go find out what their relationship was. That's a story hook. Someone got murdered mysteriously and you only have a name to go off of. That's an example of a cool story hook that the players might be interested in pursuing.\nSome players might be, “Ah, fucker died. Whatever.” and that story hook goes away. But that's up to the players and that's going to put them in the territory of being a little more neutral to evil than good players. So if they make good characters and they do stuff like that, repeatedly, they might start pushing into the evil territory and maybe drawing the ire of other NPCs nearby that are good. The captain of the guard rushes in and inspects, “What happened to this man?” and you're like “I don't know, he died.” He's like, “Grrr, I don't like the look of these people who don't care about the lives of others.” Maybe going forward, whenever they encounter the captain of the guard, he immediately mistrusts the party, and they've already established that relationship negatively.\nThere are some really great websites online that have encounter calculators where you can basically tell how difficult an encounter is based on how many players are in the party, what level they are, and you can build the encounter based on that. That way you don't end up accidentally making something that's too difficult or too easy for the party. And you don't want to make everything too hard. Some battles can be fun and easy and really kind of have the players enjoy being badass and rushing into combat and just killing things really easily and being, 'Ha-ha! I ruined everything! That's great! I am powerful!“ And you can have some battles that are pretty, \"Phew, that was close. That was a good fight.” And then occasionally you want to throw them a curveball and have something they really have to struggle through, so when they finish that battle they really have to take a rest and realize, “We almost lost one or more people in that fight,” and that makes the stakes that much higher at that point, but you don't want to constantly be hitting them with super-hard battles. You don't want to be making things consistently too easy because it isn't a fun challenge for them.\nAnd consider terrain for combat, too. Not every battle is just you versus monsters. Sometimes there's a big cliff involved and the battle could be at a distance. Sometimes there's pits of lava in the middle and that becomes a danger or a tool depending on how you look at it during the battle. Sometimes, especially in urban combat, you have rooftops and alleyways in which you can use that to your advantage to avoid things, or push guys off a roof to fall and get hurt. Or fall onto things, you know. There can be traps involved that you know are there that you can then push guys into. There's a really cool way of building encounters that are beyond just hitting things and doing damage. Which is fine, too, don't get me wrong.\nAlso, if there's a monster in the Monster Manual that you like– like, this is a really cool monster, but it's too easy, like the players are all level ten and this is a level three monster, you can customize the monster. You can make the monster more powerful. Add more hit points. Raise the stats a little more. Give it a couple of unique attacks that you think would be fitting for it. If you don't like the fact that the bulette only has like a bite and stomp attack, maybe you  decide that this bulette actually grew up or was raised around some sort of arcane, natural arcane relic that infused it with a resistance to magic and a capability that it has like electrical charges around it, and now when everyone, whenever anyone starts their turn next to it, they get shocked. It's an electric bulette! That's kinda cool. Why not? You can customize and alter any aspect of any creature in the book. Once again, all guidelines. You can go with the basis here, and it's a lot easier if you don't have a lot of time, but don't be afraid to customize and alter things to fit certain aspects of your world or your story as you see fit. It's great. I had the players in this campaign fight a proto-lich when they were level three or four. Liches will wipe the floor with pretty much anything, but I considered it would be cool to introduce that powerful undead aspect if it was like just barely cresting out of its initial ritual to become a lich, in which case it was in a very weakened state. So if they had waited a day or two, that lich would have ruined them. It was still a tough battle, but they caught it when it was still essentially birthing, which made it a very, very weak lich. That's not in the books. I just took what was there and scaled it way back. That made for a really fun encounter.\nSo, all guidelines. You can customize as you see fit, and there are great communities online of people that create creatures or beasts and have suggestions or feedback for anything you create. Don't be afraid to reach out there. Once again, I apologize, because this is a lot of information up front for trying to squeeze this in for you. Also, maps! You see in Critical Role we do combat with maps that we draw up of terrain and we have everyone has individual models and the creatures have models. That is not necessary. I have found it's very helpful for our campaign because we have eight players, which makes it very difficult for everyone to keep in mind spatial awareness during the battle, who is who and what they're doing and how close monsters are. I grew up playing Dungeons and Dragons and other RPGs without maps or models at all. It was all theater of the mind, all in the brain, which is a lot of fun, but when you get a certain critical mass of players it becomes unwieldy, so the models became necessary for us, but what we're doing tonight when we play our game, there's going to be no battlefield, no models. It's all going to be just keeping it in your head and me letting you know what's happening and where you guys are, so don't feel like it's absolutely necessary to do that. I just find it makes it easier when you have more players. And it's fun to draw maps. Sometimes it's a lot of fun to do that.\nAnother question that has come up a lot. Experience points. So, monsters that are killed or defeated in battle give you experience points. They don't necessarily have to be killed to get that experience points. If the players still win the encounter, meaning they forced them to surrender, or they managed to fight them to the point where they have to retreat. That is still a victory and the players should still get the experience for that encounter. You may give them a bonus if it's a big boss fight and they killed it and then get to reap the rewards of it. That's cool. That's totally up to you as a DM, but, you know, if they still successfully complete an encounter they still get the experience. If they flee from an encounter and the players technically lost the battle, you can still give them a little bit of experience to gain from that, but it would be largely docked by that, and that's totally up to you. That's combat experience. What about role-playing experience? That's arbitrary based on what you want to do as a DM. You can just write down, well that's cool, they get five hundred experience for that social encounter. You can make it up on the spot, and I recommend keeping an eye on what level the players are and what the experience values are for each level, so you know how much they need to get to the next level. That allows you to kind of build a structure.\nNow for me, to keep track of roleplaying experience, it's an endeavor with eight players, so what I do is I have what I call a hatch marks system, where whenever anybody does something in the game that's a cool roleplaying experience or they save a circumstance I will give them a hatch mark next to their name. Or multiple hatch marks if it was really, really clutch and really kind of changed the dynamic of the circumstance and saved their bacon. Or if they failed miserably at something but they gave it a really, really good try and it was a cool idea, I might still give them a hatch mark or two, 'cause it was a good shot. And so at the  end of each game I have a kind of an equation for myself where I multiply their level by 25, so right now they're all level ten, it would be 250 experience and that's– I give them that many, I multiply it by the number of hatch marks they get. So if somebody gets three hatch marks in a game, right now, they would get an additional 750 experience points at the end of that session based on the roleplaying experience. So that way I don't have to think too much about the math in the game, I just go, “That's cool.” Hatch mark. “That was really cool!” Hatch mark hatch mark hatch mark. And then at the end of each session I'll go ahead and multiply the level by 25 and then multiply that by how many hatch marks I've given them and that's their total roleplaying experience. That's worked well for me. It's not for everyone, but I think it's a good way to quickly add up those moments and make sure players don't feel like you're slowing it down to keep track of who's done cool shit. That's a really condensed overview of Dungeon Mastering. Um.\nMARISHA: I'm pretty stoked for the characters","response":"DM: I am excited."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We've got some good stuff going. We've got some good stuff going.\nMARISHA: Don't forget Enhance Ability!\nMARISHA: Hey don't forget, hey!","response":"DM: “– so it's plus seven to hit plus nine to damage on that?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The Hunter's Mark. Hunter's Mark! Don't forget Hunter's Mark!","response":"DM: Well, we still have that problem, but that's Laura."}
{"prompt":"Another big thing to consider for Fifth Edition is, and you guys went over it a little bit, backgrounds. Not necessary. Players that are new to the game might find it very interesting, but when you ask about your character's background and what they've done, where they come from, and how that builds them as a character, you can completely come up with whatever you want to. You can say they came from this background, they did these things, and this is all in my head in how I plan the character. Some people either are having a little bit of writer's block with their character or they don't know where to start or they just don't have a lot of experience, there's a great section in the new Player's Handbook about backgrounds, which you get to choose where your character comes from, where they grew up. They could be a folk hero, they can be a charlatan, they can be an acolyte, they can be a soldier from a war long past. They can be an entertainer, and that gives them bonus proficiencies in their skills that pertain to their background, and it gives you examples of certain personality traits that you can choose or randomly roll from. For example, go to the background section of the Player's Handbook over here, you can find– where is it?\nMARISHA: Actually, Dan made his character with his background this way.\nDAN: It's true.\nMARISHA: So we can just hear about his background as an example.","response":"DM: Right, so let's go ahead and hear about your background, Dan."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But he did roll a dice to randomly generate it.\nDAN: I did. I generated it randomly. Flip the appropriate page. (Scottish accent) So I'm Salty Pete, the first mate of the Obsidian Helen. A sailor by trade. A scoundrel by nature.\nDAN: The captain gambled with the ship, so I fed him to a long-beaked squid with razor-sharp teeth. Spent times on pontoon cigarette boats, skiffs, whoring, snoring and deploring across the land. I'm married to the sea but me best friend is a hermit crab named Terrence.\nDAN: The only left-over I have from the Helen is her flag, which I wear like a cape. I've met many friends over a buttery glass of chardonnay, sailor's choice.\nDAN: But I've lost many more. If you step to me, you best come correct. I'm on a quest to regain the Helen. I play for pink slips. Looking for clues at the bottom of a glass, oh you bet your arse I did. And now I fell in with a failed warlock named The Snugglelord.","response":"DM: And all that of was based on randomly generated information in the background section."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He clearly fleshed it out. Which is incredible.\nDAN: I added some flesh.","response":"DM: It gives you a great basis to build off of. Like, I assume you were the sailor."}
{"prompt":"DAN: Yeah, I went for the sailor archetype. It's super cool because I really liked stuff like that back when I used to do campaigns because it gives you a great basis just for, you know, if you're not sure what you want to do with your character, it gives you good branching-off points and they you can just sort of add meat to that skeleton.\nTALIESIN: Well, it's also one of the questions I hear from like people who haven't played the game before, when you first start with character creation is like, well, what are the rules on what I can be, and kind of trying to get them out of that, there are no– Forget about the rules. What do you want to be? This is like, this gives them a little set of rules that they can kind of grasp onto desperately for like their first game.\nLIAM: We'll never–\nMARISHA: Some of my favorite– oh go ahead.\nLIAM: But we'll never forget– oh and I'm eating chicken. You go ahead, I'm eating chicken.\nMARISHA: I'll go first. Some of my favorite characters that I've played with have all been people who decided what they wanted to be first and then picked a race and a class around what they wanted to be, so our good friend Paradox really wanted to be, like a roadie who–\nMARISHA: He wanted to be a roadie, essentially like a traveling circus, who was like the curtain guy for all these bands and so he made a monk who had these ropes and he had a whip and all of his abilities he would grapple people and tie people up with his ropes, and that was like what he based, he had an idea first and then built a character around. So, 'cause the system is so flexible, you can– it'll allow you to be pretty much anything you want to be.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So, one of the things I like, in Pathfinder there's like, you can make a geisha dancer who did damage with fans, so you can pretty much be whatever and then figure it out from there.","response":"DM: If it's not in the books, you can create it. You can build it. We made the gunslinger off Pathfinder here for that, so like, it's totally open and the backgrounds are a great way. They have a whole section for personality traits and you can roll for a personality trait, or multiple, and ideals. So things that really drive your character in their life. Bonds: things that really hold them, you know, via loyalty or to an ideal beyond that. And then flaws, which I love. Like right here I rolled a two as a sailor. “I'd say anything to avoid having to do extra work.” That's a great flaw for a sailor. Probably not great for his work ethic, but you know. But those are really useful things, the backgrounds is a really cool addition for those who want a jumping point for building their characters' personality."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I forgot to ask you something before the game, it's fine.\nORION: Pike–\nASHLEY: That's me! What do you need?\nORION: Do you have spell of Restoration, the thing that can reverse stone?\nASHLEY: Yes, I do.\nORION: Clarota, what do you suggest we do? Do we stay, do we leave, or do we– what do you? There are hundreds upon thousands of illithid rushing at us right now, and they don't like me very much, by the way–\nLAURA: We should get out of here!","response":"DM: At which point, Clarota turns to you and says, “You. Bring her.” Points to Kima, who is still frozen in stone mid-wielding her maul."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: To carry her?","response":"DM: “Stay but a moment; I will talk to them.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Talk to the hive.\nORION: Very good. Wait, do you want her un-stoned, or still stoned?\nMARISHA: Well, hang on. Maybe before we unstone Kima, we talk about what we should do with the Horn.\nORION: This is exactly what has to do with the Horn. Is there any way, Pike, could you perhaps half-cast it and hold the spell, don't quite undo her legs from stone, I don't want her to be mobile. I want to ask her–\nASHLEY: I don't know if I–\nSAM: If I may, very quickly, are you with us, Tiberius?\nORION: We will discuss that when we get out of here.\nSAM: Because you disappeared for like, the whole fight. Are you with us?\nORION: I am with you.\nSAM: Are you going to disappear again?\nORION: To be fair, Scanlan, I never disappeared to begin with!\nSAM: Well, you weren't there when we needed you the most. You were out doing God-knows-what.\nORION: Quite the contrary. If it wasn't for me, you'd still be fighting that damn thing.\nSAM: What on earth are you talking about?\nORION: Silence.\nSAM: Dispel Magic. Yes, I did.\nORION: Counterspell.\nSAM: Do I have a will save?\nORION: No, you're done, you're quiet.","response":"DM: That low enough level? No, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"ORION: The idea, which I will share– we don't have time to do that–\nSAM: I turn him into a goat.\nORION: He has to say that, it doesn't work.","response":"DM: I know that."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So the idea is, Pike, if we ask her why she wants the horn, if there is any other reason but to destroy it, we have to–\nSAM: Okay, then I'll Banish him.\nLAURA: (gasps)\nASHLEY: How about– well, hold on.\nTALIESIN: He can't stop it, he can't talk!","response":"DM: Also requires verbal casting."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I have to touch him, right?","response":"DM: You also have to be able to speak."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Fuck!","response":"DM: So while you're talking to them, Scanlan is tapping you and mouthing words angrily."}
{"prompt":"ORION: The idea is, if she doesn't want to destroy it, I say there's something awful, and Keyleth, I believe you want to destroy it, yes?\nMARISHA: Well, yes, I mean why does she want to take it back up to the surface if it's that terrible?\nORION: I know this is, did you say Orcus, is that his name?","response":"DM: Orcus, yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: This thing is no good at all.\nMARISHA: Why don't we just throw it in some lava?\nORION: Where is some lava? I would much like to do that.\nMARISHA: Well, we're around lava, right?\nTRAVIS: We were.\nLAURA: We're not around lava now.\nTALIESIN: It's a thing of earth. Perhaps taking it to the surface is necessary to destroy it. Why don't we have a conversation with her?\nORION: But she wanted to take it back to Emon. That is not appropriate, we need to destroy this.\nTALIESIN: Let's get some information first.\nORION: I dispel Silence.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's get some information, let's figure out–\nSAM: Oh hi, hi there.\nORION: Sorry, I just wanted to get the point across.\nASHLEY: I can un-stone her.\nTALIESIN: We'll un-stone her, it's not like she can take it from us.\nASHLEY: That's my last 5th-level spell, so we might need to rest.\nTALIESIN: If something horrible happens, we're going to run anyway at this point.","response":"DM: I assume you guys have come down in here then."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm staying up, can I not–\nSAM: Then how did we have this whole conversation?\nORION: Oh, then I'd be down there.\nLAURA: I was planning on staying up. I'm not leaving Trinket up there.","response":"DM: Okay. Good."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Why don't we find out what happens next? And if we have to, you can teleport us out of here, correct?\nORION: Oh, I have a wonderful escape plan.\nMARISHA: Okay, so Clarota, how much time do we have before something happens next?","response":"DM: As you say that, Clarota turns, and the two stone doorways on each side of the temple shift open and you notice three mind flayers glide in from the side of the room."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I notch my arrow.\nORION: No, no! Stop, no don't. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.","response":"DM: Two small, bi-pedal, brain-like creatures."}
{"prompt":"ALL: No! No.","response":"DM: At which point, Clarota puts his hands up like this."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm grappled, so.","response":"DM: Yeah, you're still being held back, but you can try to break from the grapple if you want to roll an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You're like an extra in Big Trouble in Little China.\nTRAVIS: Oh, it's a 12! I looked at acrobatics.","response":"DM: Still not enough, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wait, but I cast– nope, never mind! Keep going!","response":"DM: Okay. As they begin to move in, and are hovering forward, looking around the room, taking in the scenery, but they're all focused toward the center, they're all just moving towards the Elder Brain. And they make their way up towards it, looking very intent and very frightened at the prospect of what maybe has happened in this room. As they all approach, you can see that low, dull, kind of purplish glow of the Elder Brain is still pumping, but slowly brighter and brighter, almost like it's coming to more life. You can hear the cage rattling of the various entities that are still inside, like the one that's still grappling Grog off to the side. The horn of Orcus, which is still being held aloft by your Telekinesis spell, is just hovering through the air, slowly rotating on its own, little strips of K'Varn's flesh still freshly tumbling from the side."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And it's at the halfway point between where she is and where I'm standing.","response":"DM: So right here?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, right there.","response":"DM: Not this big, of course."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's really heavy, guys!","response":"DM: As they all move towards the center, Clarota, with his hands up, turns around, pulls back the hood, and steps towards the other mind flayers, hands stretched out, moving up to the point here."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (whispers) Can you instill an inspiration?\nSAM: Inspire him? I think he's pretty good on his own.\nORION: “Don't do anything.” I'm saying this on the ears.","response":"DM: The three illithid look over and notice Clarota, and there's a good 20 or 30 seconds of silence as they just look at each other. At which point, Clarota kind of turns around to the rest of the group and looks at them, looks at all of you and lowers his head a little bit as the mind flayers move in towards Clarota, one reaches over and pulls the cap from the back of his head, removes it, at which point Clarota raises up, and if you think you've ever seen an entity with tentacles for a mouth smile, the creases in his awful, rubbery, fleshy face almost give a look of joy, of rediscovered connection, and he looks out to the rest of you and bows a head for a second. I need Grog, Scanlan, Tiberius, Vax, and Pike to all make–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Tiberius, if he fucks us.\nSAM: I think he's about to.","response":"DM: Intelligence saving throws."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, I'm grappled! I'm raging, but. Fuck yes! Intelligence saving throws?","response":"DM: Intelligence saving throws."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Thank god I rolled high.\nORION: Natural 20.","response":"DM: Not very wise, there, Grog."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17.\nSAM: Is this a charm?","response":"DM: This would be– no, it would not be."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So wait, am I still an elemental? Is that the deal?\nORION: It's 23.","response":"DM: 23, 20. Scanlan?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 12.","response":"DM: 12. Pike?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: She needs better dice.\nASHLEY: I rolled a six.","response":"DM: Okay. Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh. 17.\nMARISHA: You didn't have me roll.","response":"DM: Oh, you need to roll as well, sorry, you're in the blast there. You're still an earth elemental."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I thought I was immune to this kind of stuff. (groans) What do I– not good.\nTRAVIS: I passed, right?","response":"DM: No, you passed this. You're fine."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Teleport us out of here!\nORION: It doesn't work like that. It's what I was trying to say earlier!","response":"DM: Scanlan, you are currently stunned, you are actually unable to physically move. Pike, as well. The rest of you manage to resist the Mind Blast, but at this point in time you can now see that this crew, including Clarota, now reconnected with its people, your purpose serving its end, you're about to be swarmed by the rest of the entire city."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Son of a bitch, taint, fuck!","response":"DM: Let's roll initiative, guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We should've gotten out of here!\nTRAVIS: I never trusted that Magneto motherfucker! Fuck.\nLAURA: 21.\nMARISHA: 21, as well.","response":"DM: Nice. 20 to 15?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 19.\nTALIESIN: 17.\nASHLEY: 16.\nLIAM: 14.\nSAM: 13.\nTRAVIS: Eight. Against mind flayers. We're fucking fighting brains and mind flayers again.\nLAURA: We're all going to die.\nMARISHA: Okay, wait, you guys run.","response":"DM: Vex, you're up first."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can start bringing down the palace.\nLAURA: I'm stuck at the top. Until we can run, we're stuck, because there's only one flying carpet.\nTRAVIS: Tiberius has got something for us, right?\nLAURA: I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the Elder Brain and shoot Hail of Thorns into the Elder Brain.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes! I like that idea!\nMARISHA: I'm going to start bringing down the temple! Are we okay with that?\nTRAVIS: We're still in it.\nORION: Not while we're still in it.\nMARISHA: Well, I mean it'll take some time, I'm sure.\nTRAVIS: Or it could happen really quick.","response":"DM: As you guys do notice– you guys are beginning to see what looks like shadows seemingly coming out from the outside, and you hear what seems to be slight cackling of things sort of in the doorways. So you're shooting Hail of Thorns down into the Elder Brain? Go ahead and roll for the attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 19?","response":"DM: 19 will hit, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We're going to be dead in ten minutes.","response":"DM: What, the teleportation one?"}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, does this mean you can go and we'll distract?\nORION: No, don't look at it! You said one minute, that's the DM, DM is god.\nLAURA: Do I roll regular damage, plus the Hail of Thorns?","response":"DM: I thought it was."}

Yes!\nMARISHA: All of us except for Laura and Trinket.\nTALIESIN: And I'm on the carpet, so I can head that direction.\nLAURA: And then 18 for the second.","response":"DM: Okay, so you release the first Hail of Thorns. The arrow shatters into a whole–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And anything within five feet takes damage, as well.","response":"DM: That'll be all four of them. How much damage do they take?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They take the same amount unless they make–","response":"DM: Unless they make a what? Do they have a saving throw against it?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh wait. Yeah. They take half damage on a saving throw.","response":"DM: Okay. Against what? So two of them make it, two of them don't."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Look, look, I do double damage to objects and structures. That's the thing, I'm really good at tearing shit down.\nORION: Now, sometimes fighting isn't the right thing to do!\nMARISHA: That's why I'm not talking about fighting, I'm talking about collapsing buildings!\nLAURA: I want to do my second attack.","response":"DM: Yeah, that's right!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah. 15?","response":"DM: 15 does not hit, unfortunately. You actually fire down and it hits the stonework and the arrow splinters against it. Stay where you are?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't know what else to do. I'm stuck up at the top.","response":"DM: Jump? What could possibly go wrong! Okay, that's the end of your turn. Keyleth, you're up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Keyleth!\nMARISHA: I think my best use– I agree we need to get out of here, but I'm going to–","response":"DM: You have shadows moving in from the two open doorways on each side right now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What, so the Elder Brain– is this a wooden well, or a stone well? What is this?","response":"DM: Essentially it's a giant stone platform that houses the Elder Brain at the center."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Here's what I can do. I can start breaking the well, or I can start blocking entrances. I can start pulling down–\nTRAVIS: That one, the second one.\nTALIESIN: The second one.\nMARISHA: The second one?\nTRAVIS: The second one, close the doorway.","response":"DM: This is one doorway. That's the other."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I thought he said it was big.","response":"DM: That– ooh, that's maybe not enough. Yeah no, that's longer than 35 feet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Just bull rush and tear down the well.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, do it. Fuck it, do what you want to do.","response":"DM: What do you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We need to get out! Or take down the Elder Brain.","response":"DM: Okay, what are you doing? Are you casting a spell?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, I'm going to start– can I bull rush, not necessarily right next to the door but like right here, and I'm going to elemental-slam into the wall and siege monster this.","response":"DM: What's the movement speed of the earth elemental?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 35 feet.","response":"DM: 35 feet? As it's still able to move through stone as well?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah! Well, actually, no. When I move through stone I think I can move 60 feet!","response":"DM: Okay, it is a thick floor. You actually shift into the stonework of the flooring itself and coast through, popping up right out there. That'll get you right at the doorway. You can see there is a slow spiraling incline, like a small– like an inclined pathway that you can see four illithid making their way up right now, with some large looming stomping sounds coming up behind them."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Perfect! So I materialize, using my girth to take up the door, and then I just go (deep voice) boom! And start bringing it down.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and make your slam attack or attacks, depending on how many–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Slam, I guess.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Get it, Keyleth.\nMARISHA: 26!","response":"DM: 26, okay go ahead and roll damage on that. Since you are an earth elemental, you do extra siege damage against structures, don't you?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yes!","response":"DM: 42 points of damage. So the stone structure, which is pretty rigid and this is an old, old structure; the strange, weird, non-Euclidean design of it has a slight warbling feel to it. You take both of your earth elemental fists and slam them into the side. As you do, the structure gives way and a good 30 feet or so crumbles down around you. You can feel the stones raining onto you. Because of your proximity, you take four points of impact damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I like it! It feels good! This is what I bathe in!","response":"DM: This entire doorway is ruined, and there's a good 15-foot pile of stonework now blocking that entranceway."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 15-foot pile?","response":"DM: Yeah. But there's a hole above it, where the stone fell through. So there is about 50 feet up a section of the wall that is collapsed down."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Whatever, it'll make it harder. Right, that's my turn.","response":"DM: Okay, do recall that mind flayers do levitate."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Aw. (groans) God! Maybe not now, they don't?\nORION: Yeah, okay–","response":"DM: You can also see forms swarming through the other doorway over there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Teleport us!\nORION: This isn't good.\nLAURA: Fly us! Get us out.\nORION: How far? Scanlan's only like a foot away from me, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm right next to him!","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh!\nTRAVIS: Beam us out, Scotty.\nORION: Shit. Okay. I cast Fly on myself.\nORION: I redact that, actually. Is it possible– I'm at least standing next to him, right?","response":"DM: You are."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I don't have to use a move action right now. I can, like, look at him.\nSAM: I leap!\nORION: Okay, can I give him– can I take off my Ioun Stone as an action, and swap his crown?","response":"DM: No, I'm pretty sure– if the item says “attunement” on it, you have to spend a short rest attuning yourself with the weapon. If either of them does."}
{"prompt":"ORION: But he didn't. He hasn't attuned himself to the thing yet.\nSAM: To what?","response":"DM: Right, but your Ioun stone– you mean take it from him?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah!","response":"DM: You would have to attune it to yourself in order to use it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: How long does it take?","response":"DM: It takes a short rest."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Shit! Okay, that changes everything in a very bad way.","response":"DM: What are you doing? The other doorway isn't blocked, you have mind flayers running in, you have probably more and more swarming from underneath the temple, probably over at some point, from what you've seen of the temple structure."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, so I'm going to attempt to crush the Horn. With a thousand pounds of pressure.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Because my Telekinesis is still going.","response":"DM: That's true."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I can't do anything else without dropping this thing because as soon as I do anything else, I drop the horn. So I have to do that first.","response":"DM: Okay, so you use your action, go ahead and roll for that, for the crushing of Telekinesis."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh god.\nORION: What am I adding?","response":"DM: You're adding your modifier, which I think is five."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, 23.","response":"DM: As you focus intensely, you feel that the Horn itself– the sheer force of the artifact is far too powerful for your meager magic to have any sort of effect on its physical structure."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I thought so.\nTRAVIS: Fuck that horn.","response":"DM: That's your action."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to–\nLAURA: Float it into the Bag of Holding!\nORION: I'm going to maneuver around the chaos because I'm not within range of anybody to hurt me, right?","response":"DM: Not currently, no."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So I'm going to hop on the carpet.\nLIAM: This is all taking six seconds, by the way.","response":"DM: 30, that's as far as you can get."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, I can run.","response":"DM: You already used your action to Telekinesis."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh. That's stupid.","response":"DM: That's how it works."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to start flying straight up, and while I'm flying straight up, I'm going to take… two shots with the Pepperbox at the big brain.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and roll twice."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to use Sharpshooter. That's a 21? That's 21.","response":"DM: 21 does hit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And should I do both hits?","response":"DM: Yeah, roll both."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, and– no, that's right, I don't critical at 19?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, I need a specialty. Damn it! And that hits, so both hit, and they're both with Sharpshooter, so that's nice. (sings) I haven't pulled my dice out yet. There we go.\nLIAM: Come on, gunslinger!\nTALIESIN: Oh, that's nice! 25 points of damage.\nTALIESIN: And 17 points of damage.\nTALIESIN: Oh, sorry. I forgot, sorry, four points of fire damage.\nMARISHA: Things can hurt really bad and not do that much damage.","response":"DM: Clarota spins and comes up behind you–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't be a dick.\nTRAVIS: Remember our days watching Saved by the Bell together?\n(gasping)\nTRAVIS: Whose?","response":"DM: You immediately take 15 points of psychic damage and you are currently grappled."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And stunned.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (sings) Grappled and stunned, so grappled and stunned!\nASHLEY: Ugh, okay.\nTRAVIS: We're just trying to stay alive.\nASHLEY: I just rolled a one.","response":"DM: Your physical form is still unable to pull yourself out of that continuous psychic pain, you're like (groans) trying to just tear your mind out of it, unable to do so. Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, I click my Boots of Haste and I'm going to– where's the thingie, do we have a thingie here?\nASHLEY: What do you need?\nLIAM: The light.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: You can rush there, you would have to get up onto here."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, that's what I want to do, and then, I don't know. That's not my full double-movement, I don't know how that affects the number of attacks I have Hasted, but I just want to stab it as many times as I can, standing on top of this thing.\nLIAM: Where's the meteorite die?\nORION: Fuck you, couch!\nLIAM: Using my poison dagger.\nTRAVIS: Prison shank that thing.\nLIAM: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to shiv him in his shank or shank him in his shiv, whichever is the more accurate phrase.\nTRAVIS: Can you scream out “lobotomy” while you do it?","response":"DM: As a note, as you rush by, for an attack of opportunity, the intellect devourer does reach out and strike at you with its claws."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: Rolls a one. You just kick it off to the side, it rolls on its side, its brain matter (clunks) on the ground."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do I get two or three attacks?","response":"DM: You get three if you use your bonus to attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: First one misses. Second one is– oh wait, the first was a 17, is that–\nLAURA: That doesn't miss.\nLIAM: Hit or miss, it's a brain, right, I'm standing–","response":"DM: Total 17? That would still– it doesn't miss, but as you strike down for it, there's a psychic field that's defending it, and your blade is held at bay by the protective sphere."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, then I'm using now dagger of venom is 26.","response":"DM: Okay, that does hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so that's four plus six is ten, because this isn't Sneak Attack or anything.","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's ten plus a poison for a DC of 15?","response":"DM: Okay. It makes its saving throw. Rolled a 17."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So that was that, and then the third attack I'll go back to the keen dagger. 14.","response":"DM: 14. The second one strikes through, the poison tries to pulse through but once again it resists the impact; the third dagger comes down and before it even gets halfway towards, there's a blast of psychic energy from the inside of the containment unit that holds the Elder Brain that (boof) forces your hand back, the attack deflected entirely. That ends your turn. The other three illithids now go."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I wish we had inspiration.\nORION: Isn't there a rope still hanging from there? Throw the damn rope!\nLAURA: You can climb it.\nLIAM: Yeah, I can probably get up 15 feet and hang there.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I'm getting a massage right now.","response":"DM: This one's also going to turn around, reach forward, and its tentacles are going to attempt to wrap around Pike's head–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Don't you touch my friend.","response":"DM: That's going to be a 20?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A natural 20?","response":"DM: No, it's just 20. So Pike, you go ahead and take– this'll be 15 points of psychic damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It was a good run, folks.\nMARISHA: What happened?\nLAURA: He rolled a 20.\nASHLEY: So he rolled a 20.","response":"DM: I rolled a total of 20. And you're stunned currently, so you take 15 points of psychic damage as you feel– as you're trying to resist yourself, these cold tentacles wrap across the front of your field of vision, and you can feel this weird, toothy, pointy, biting sensation beginning to push towards the back of your skull. This one–"}

{"prompt":"ORION: 17, man!","response":"DM: 17, as you're rushing toward the magic carpet that just took off, yeah, you look over and the tentacles swing toward you, you duck just underneath and manage to avoid the attack. Now the two intellect devourers. One's going to go ahead and look up towards the magic carpet that's taking off and– here we go. Oh,\nwithin ten feet? No, you're too far away. So instead it's going to go for you on top of the Elder Brain. I want you to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw, Vax."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20, natural 20.","response":"DM: Natural 20!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Needed that.\nLAURA: That's not to Matt, that's to the little brains.\nLIAM: The brains, the brains.\nMARISHA: Fuck you, little brains.","response":"DM: So you feel a similar blast of screaming energy, like you feel from the illithids, but it's more primal and more guttural. You manage to shrug it off in your mind and angrily look down at this weird, fleshy creature. The other one moves up and attempts to blast you again from the opposite side. Make another intelligence saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 19.","response":"DM: 19! Once again you feel from the back of your brain this like stunning impact and you shrug it off looking over this way."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (jeering) I'm smart!\nSAM: I'm grappled and stunned.","response":"DM: Yeah, so go ahead and make your saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Come on, buddy.\nORION: Boom!","response":"DM: You shrug off the stunned effect, you're currently grappled by the entity."}
{"prompt":"LAURA, ASHLEY, and MARISHA: You're so smart!\nTRAVIS: Cardiac kid, come on now, here we go. Table's getting hot.\nLIAM: Aren't you inspired?","response":"DM: And then also make an intelligence saving throw."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, Jesus. Because he's also got the things on me.\nLIAM: Just say 20.\nLIAM: Big nine.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I said big nine.\nASHLEY: He rolled a 20, so that's gotta mean something.\nTALIESIN: I think a nine is a big six.\nMARISHA: The 20 carries over one, right?\nTRAVIS: Residual?\nMARISHA: You take the one and you carry it over.\nTRAVIS: Natural 20 residual.\nLIAM: I personally can't wait until we roll new characters next show.\nLAURA: No.\nMARISHA: Shut up!","response":"DM: Unfortunately, you're still stunned."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Still stunned? Oh, so I got off–","response":"DM: You resisted the mind effect, but the tentacles on your head are now locking your brain in place, and your eyes are kind of rolling back in your head as you feel the illithid's mouth begin to push against the outside of your head. Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I've got to break my grapple, right?","response":"DM: Yeah. Just go ahead and roll an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: One.","response":"DM: A natural one?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: This guy.","response":"DM: A natural one; it rolled a four!"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Plus your strength! Oh, it doesn't matter.\nTALIESIN: It doesn't matter.","response":"DM: Okay. So it's still holding you in place; you have your axe you picked up off the ground with your chain of returning; you can't physically move from your position as it's holding you there."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The axe is across the room, remember?","response":"DM: Well, no, you threw it over here and retrieved it at the end of the battle."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well that's a good, that's a good plus.\nASHLEY: (frustrated noise)\nMARISHA: The fuck!","response":"DM: So what do you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You could attack with your chain.\nTRAVIS: I can attack with the chain?","response":"DM: You have your axe with your chain of returning, you just can't move, but you can still throw if you want to."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, awesome.\nMARISHA: Can you chop the dude's arms off?\nTRAVIS: I have no– it's holding me, I don't think I can be like–\nASHLEY: Maybe the guy that has him, his tentacles or whatever?\nTRAVIS: I was going to try and save you.\nASHLEY: Well. That's far.\nTRAVIS: Can I reach the illithid– it's far?","response":"DM: Well, you can throw to either of them right now. They're both bent over gnome heads, they're bigger–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Where's Scanlan?\nASHLEY: Why the gnomes?","response":"DM: He's here, and that's Pike."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Why the gnome hate?\nMARISHA: It's rare. It's a rare delicacy.","response":"DM: You guys were right there."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Tasty gnome.\nLIAM: All the fans who implied that Matt went light on us the last game–\nTRAVIS: 22?","response":"DM: 22, definitely hits, go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay, it's just one, two, three. Shit balls. 14.\nTRAVIS: No, I'm done.","response":"DM: Do you want to pull your axe back?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes, I would like to.","response":"DM: Go ahead and you (grunts). Go ahead and make your check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What do I, what the fuck do I roll, to the thing. What do I roll? A 12?","response":"DM: Yeah. A 20, you have to roll a d20, that was a d12."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay, good.\nTRAVIS: 18.","response":"DM: So you pull on the chain of returning and it yanks the axes out of the wound and you catch it in midair, preparing for the next round."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Get it.\nSAM: Save everyone.","response":"DM: You're up at the top, you have a clear view of everyone."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's true, you're the only one with a bird's-eye view.\nSAM: Just run. Save yourself.","response":"DM: As it is, these two illithids look kind of hurt, these two look really rough, this one looks really rough, both of these guys haven't been damaged yet but they have low hit points."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Save yourself, start a new race of people.\nLAURA: I am going to attack–\nSAM: Hunter's Mark!\nLAURA: I'm going to put Hunter's Mark on– oh, my brother just died.\nLIAM: I fainted.\nLAURA: On the one attacking Scanlan.\nTALIESIN: Not on Scanlan, on the one attacking Scanlan.","response":"DM: Oh right, sorry."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What did he do?","response":"DM: In the confusion–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (shrieking) Help!\nORION: Friendly fire!\nASHLEY: That was amazing.\nLAURA: 14?","response":"DM: 14 unfortunately does–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Plus! Plus War God's Blessing?","response":"DM: You're stunned."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: But can't I just do it just because?","response":"DM: No, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Once, just this once, please?","response":"DM: Unfortunately, no."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But he's bent over and I've got a bird's-eye view of him.","response":"DM: You know what? He is grappling and he is right in the way, I'll go ahead and give you advantage on that attack. Roll again."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes! So I just roll again?","response":"DM: Roll again. Take whatever it is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 22!","response":"DM: 22 will hit, okay. Because it is a stationary position, completely engulfing, and you have such a great view from above."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right? 11 points of damage?","response":"DM: Okay. Did you roll your Hunter's Mark damage?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, I did not.","response":"DM: Don't forget Hunter's Mark."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I won't, though. Three extra. That's for Hunter's Mark.\nASHLEY: 14 total?","response":"DM: Okay, gotcha. That's your first strike."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 16 plus– 19.","response":"DM: 19, okay. Both arrows (zoomf, zoomf), one embeds itself in the wound that Grog had left with the axe and you see the body tenses. Clarota stares up at you with this beaming angry look on his face; you realize, oh shit, Clarota's the one that's going after Scanlan. Your second arrow you bring down and release and it pierces the side of its face, gashing through and embedding itself in the chest. You can see now Clarota's looking really rough, but he's still holding taut. This horrible thought goes into your mind suddenly, a familiar voice saying, “You've all done your work. Now it's time to feast!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (gasps) He turned on us!\nLAURA: I knew he was going to do that!\nSAM: What? None of us knew that!\nLAURA: I totally knew he was going to do that.\nTRAVIS: I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota.\nASHLEY: Every week.\nTRAVIS: Every week!\nSAM: You know who would help us right now?\nLAURA: Kima would help us, but she's stone.\nSAM: Can we make her not stone?\nASHLEY: We can make her not stone, except we didn't get a chance to.\nLIAM: If we live, we're in store for so much I-told-you-so.\nLIAM: It's a big if.\nSAM: Maybe we should leave her. I don't want to deal with that.\nTRAVIS: Who's up?\nMARISHA: I can make, I'm going to– aw, crap. I'm going to phase down, and I'm going to pop up, and I'm going to break the well that's holding the Elder Brain.\nASHLEY: Get it!","response":"DM: Okay, so you're going to pop up here? Over here?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, not there!","response":"DM: Right there?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Not where I might hurt Vax.\nSAM: Well, that's anywhere.\nLAURA: Just do the other side!\nMARISHA: You might have to do, like, a flippy-poo off it.","response":"DM: So what are you doing on the well, you're just grabbing it?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I? Can I flip?","response":"DM: No, it's embedded in the ground. What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, okay, so I want to take and I want to just punch to crack a big side of it to help spill out the brains.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and make a slam attack on the side"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Bust the side of it open.\nASHLEY: And then we'll stomp on him and make brain juice.\nMARISHA: I mean, it's an item, it's a stationary rock, so what do I add? Oh wait, I add– so plus– sorry, I'm not used to this. Plus eight, 16?","response":"DM: 16? You slam into the side of this; you're not attacking the brain, you're attacking the stonework. You can feel there is some psychic resistance, but because you're not attacking the brain directly, your fist slams into it, making purchase in the stone. Go ahead and roll damage against the stone."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Come on!","response":"DM: Double damage on this."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Big damage!\nMARISHA: 20 damage.\nTRAVIS: Yes!","response":"DM: 20 damage. The side of the stonework crumples inward. Pieces of the stonework itself seem to be jutting in toward the Elder Brain, but it's stopped by some sort of psychic resistance, but the whole side here to here is now just open entirely, and you can see now the hole, the mass of– there's probably hundreds of various illithid brains that have slowly congealed into one large brain structure as now you can see the underneath area. The liquid it kind of sits in is now pouring out, down the side of the structure."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hope they have flood insurance.\nTRAVIS: That was the worst Schwarzenegger action line ever. (Terminator voice) Hope they have flood insurance, ja.\nMARISHA: The Geico slayer!\nTRAVIS: Holy shit. That was amazing.\nTALIESIN: That's no better, actually.\nMARISHA: From Progressive Flo? All the flow of the– you know what, never mind.","response":"DM: So you only have the one slam attack? Earth elemental doesn't multi-attack?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes, just the one. My slam attack is–","response":"DM: Right. Cool."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh no, wait! I have multi– earth elemental makes two slam attacks!","response":"DM: That's good to know. Go ahead and make another one."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I could have done that last time?","response":"DM: Are you attacking the stonework still?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, I'm just going to take the other chunk and punch it.","response":"DM: Okay. So we'll say you used some of your movement to move this way. By the way, guys, you can break up your movement. You can move, attack, then move if you want to."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You can?","response":"DM: Yeah!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Unless Tickle-me-Elmo is holding you by the cage.\nMARISHA: It's cocked. 16 plus eight, so 22.","response":"DM: That'll definitely do it; go ahead. Is that total damage? Oh, that's the attack. Okay, go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ugh, four plus– 18 damage.","response":"DM: 18's fine. So you break out the second half and now the entire side of it is open. All the fluid just spilled out the side and you get the sensation this is very frowned upon."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A tentacle frown.\nORION: So I rush up, and Percy takes off?","response":"DM: As a note too, just so you guys are aware–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I didn't know you were coming to the carpet, sorry.\nLAURA: Oh no, we never closed the other door!","response":"DM: You start seeing a series of other entities slowly making their way up from the downstairs tunnel area."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I think we can beat them all.\nORION: Seeing what's going on– there's an illithid right behind me, right?","response":"DM: There is. Right behind you, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I thought she closed the door.\nLAURA: No, we didn't.","response":"DM: Yeah, the other door is open."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I closed the one, but then he said that they could levitate so I decided it wasn't worth it.\nSAM: Hey, man. Grog's being held prisoner by an 80-pound dude.\nORION: So I'm running off and then Percy takes off? So I can't get to him?","response":"DM: Yeah, he's (whoosh), you can't get to him."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Awesome.\nTRAVIS: I'm so ashamed right now.\nORION: I need a technical question. Can I move the Horn and let go of the spell so I can then do my turn? Or does that take a thing to do that? Like, I want to let it go–","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Good. So as I'm running up to the carpet, I see Percy go and I'm like, “(growls) Damn Tiamat-lover!” So I bring over the Horn and right at the tip, on the carpet, I let it go. “You deal with it then!”","response":"DM: Percy?"}
{"prompt":"(loud clatter)\nLAURA: Oh no, K'Varn!","response":"DM: That's what you get!"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I don't give it to Percy, I let it land on the carpet.","response":"DM: I know. I'm saying it's on his carpet right now, staring at him from the side."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Put it on, Percy!\nORION: I see the– oh god. Okay, I can only do this once. I see the– they're not inside yet, right?","response":"DM: No. They're just starting to get to the doorway. You can see them right there."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Awesome. Okay, that is a– and this is a– Okay.","response":"DM: What you got, Tiberius?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (Tiberius voice) Poppycock, poppycock.\nORION: Right. I have– I blow everything. I'm going to blow everything.\nTRAVIS: Yes! Blow everybody.","response":"DM: How diplomatic of you!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm stunned!\nORION: You cannot resist!","response":"DM: So, Tiberius."}
{"prompt":"ORION: As I leave the Horn there, I turn to where the door is. Obelisk of Stone. I seal up the entryway.","response":"DM: How many with that, what level are you using it?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, how wide is it? Like 15 feet?","response":"DM: It's a little over five feet wide."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Great. I only need one, right?","response":"DM: Technically, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay. So I seal that one– I'm going to use all three right now.\nMARISHA: Seal the other one, too. I only partially sealed it.\nORION: I'll seal the other one.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I'll use the other one on myself.","response":"DM: Okay!"}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I'm going to use– I only have three left. Yeah, okay. And I'm going to use my last three sorcerer points that I have, and I have zero points after this, and I'm going to cast Blur on myself. And that's my turn.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Betraying bastard.\nTALIESIN: With Sharpshooter, that's 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. 19 points?","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That hits, and let's do my damage. That's 22 points of damage.","response":"DM: Okay. So, Scanlan, as you're stunned, you feel the tentacles swirling around the back of your head. Teeth are grinding into the back of your skull, and you feel this horrible pain as all of a sudden, Clarota's mouth is beginning to find a way towards your skull."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN and MARISHA: Traitor!\nLAURA: I can't believe we killed Clarota!\nTALIESIN: Some people have no sense of fucking honor!\nMARISHA: Traitor!\nTRAVIS: Oh, Percy!","response":"DM: In a split second, your longtime ally, now turncoat, is scattered across the stone floor. You're released, you're no longer stunned."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (gasps) Hi, guys!\nTALIESIN: I still have another shot.","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: There's someone on Pike, right?","response":"DM: There's still one on Pike right now, yeah, right here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm taking a shot there.\nTRAVIS: Come on, Perce!\nASHLEY: Perce!\nMARISHA: Pew pew!\nTALIESIN: Oh yeah! So that's 17– 17, 18, 19–","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And did we get a short rest before this fight happened?\nSAM and LAURA: No.\nTALIESIN: Fuck, never mind.","response":"DM: No you did not."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's why we're all burnt out on spells.\nTALIESIN: That's why we're all burnt out on shit, okay.\nORION: Except me.","response":"DM: Yeah, the other one–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to go up further.","response":"DM: Even further? Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: “Because I didn't help you guys!” Thanks, Tiberius!\nASHLEY: “I abandoned my troop!”\nORION: It's going to come in handy now!\nTALIESIN: Am I high enough yet for her to jump down onto the–","response":"DM: Yeah, you could probably pull it off."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So, if you and your bear want to jump on?","response":"DM: It'd be an acrobatics roll, but yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, why would you– you've got to come save us!\nLAURA: Yeah, no, go down and save them, honestly, because I'm staying up top for right now, unless we can teleport out.\nTALIESIN: Oh, in that case, instead of going up I'm going to go fly to the right, then.\nORION: Pick up Vax!\nLAURA: Why?\nORION: I said Vax.\nLAURA: Vax?\nMARISHA: Vax? Pick up Vax?\nORION: Yes.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm going to fly down towards Vax, as well.","response":"DM: Okay. So you're going down to here instead?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, you can get about– we'll say, if you're just going–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, go there.\nTALIESIN: Hi.\nASHLEY, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Hey you guys!","response":"DM: Okay. That ends your turn. That brings it–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Did anything happen to the guy that had me–","response":"DM: He just took damage, but he's not done yet."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: He just took damage, he's still (slurps).","response":"DM: So, Pike, it's your turn."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: It's my turn.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll to get rid of the Mind Blast stun."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Come on.\nSAM: Come on, Pikey.\nASHLEY: Fuck. It's seven.","response":"DM: Seven? Nope. You're still locked in place."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Can you heal yourself?","response":"DM: She cannot move. Her entire brain is locked in with a searing clenching pain, psychic energy is just clutching her brain and holding it hostage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Still beautiful, though.","response":"DM: You feel, once again, the teeth beginning to pierce the back of the flesh. You feel the teeth of the mind flayer beginning to scrape against the skull, the actual bone it's found in the back. Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What did Clarota do with his hat?","response":"DM: Oh, it's somewhere on the ground over here."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Over behind–","response":"DM: Over behind this."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, I'm still Hasted, I'm going to run down the center over Clar– I'm going to step on Clarota's– I don't know if he has nuts, but whatever's there, I'm going to step there, run around Scanlan, and place his fucking hat on my head.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And then run up behind that third mind flayer, who I don't think has taken a hit yet, and just start stabbing him in the back.","response":"DM: Right here?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, on Pike!\nLIAM: I can't get back there.\nLAURA: You can't?\nLIAM: I don't think so.\nLAURA: Would he be able to make it?\nLIAM: Well it's up to– oh dear.","response":"DM: You can't, with the speed you're running there, because your Hasted speed is doubled, so it's 60 feet."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm Hasted, I can run 12 spaces, so if you think that I could have run around the mind flayer, put on the party hat–","response":"DM: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. You can move right there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, great. So I'm going to start stabbing him in the back, angrily.\nLIAM: Okay, yeah, so, first one is a 15?","response":"DM: Unfortunately– no, that does just hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's a Sneak Attack, because she's next to him. There's nothing in the rule book about stunned, or unconscious, or anything.","response":"DM: How Sneak Attack works is if they're next to someone that's aggressive toward them; they feel like they have people on two fronts, which is why you get the benefit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: He is, to be fair, very occupied.","response":"DM: I will say, circumstantially though, because he is currently grappled on to Pike, and is in the process of trying to grind into her brain with his mouth, he is a little preoccupied at the moment."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He's sucking head.","response":"DM: So I'm going to go ahead and make a perception roll versus your fast movement. Go ahead and make a stealth– roll stealth to see whether or not he takes notice and changes his position in defense."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I rolled a 24.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead. The first attack you rolled was a 15, that hits!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, thank you.","response":"DM: And that is a Sneak Attack, he did not see you coming that quickly."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I'm sticking that in the back of his neck.","response":"DM: Okay. That was your first attack?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's the first attack.","response":"DM: Okay, so the first dagger (shnk) sinks into the back of the neck. You just manage to miss all the seriously vital stuff, but you carve a giant section out of the side of its head. The rest of its leathery black outfit's now slick with its own blood. You see it angrily growls, almost this weird guttural, this (gurgling growl) sound as it still remains taut and clenched on Pike, its eyes glaring at you, basically telling you, “Look what I'm about to do to your friend.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so good thing I have more knives. So I take the other one, flip it in my hand and then stick it into the neck afterwards. That's a 24.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, it does. That's eight. Fire damage, I don't know if he takes any fire damage, and I'm going to then stick him with my poison dagger, which isn't going to poison him. But that is a 26 which hits as well.","response":"DM: That does hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And that is eight.","response":"DM: Eight points of damage. So the first one you stab in the side of the head, you pull back and toss it in the air, catch the second one. As it bursts into flames you place the searing dagger down into the center of its back between its shoulder blades. Its back tenses, and as it does it reaches back and tries to grab for the dagger as you pull back the third one. As it looks back at you it brings up one arm to stop you as it goes in to directly go after Pike's head. The third dagger you then stab it right in the front of the skull. Its eyes roll back in its head and its tentacles limply drag off."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: As a bonus action, I would like to Goodfellas-kick him about eight times in the ribs.\nMARISHA: Yes!","response":"DM: I'll allow it. Oh my god. Because that guy was next! If we didn't kill him this turn, she would've taken 55 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 50– Let's not even say the number.\nASHLEY: You saved my life.","response":"DM: Yeah. And if it takes you to zero hit points, they extract the brain and eat it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Now we've got to squish those little brains.\nLIAM: There's still a mind flayer.\nTRAVIS: We're coming real close.","response":"DM: Let's see if they get their Mind Blast back. Nope. Nope."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This show is not good for my blood pressure.\nMARISHA: I know! It's like constant fight or flight.\nTRAVIS: I think I'm going blind in my left eye.\nMARISHA: This should fix your sleep schedule though, right?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, totally.\nMARISHA: I'm an elemental, so.","response":"DM: You keep your intelligence score as you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I do?","response":"DM: The physical attributes you get from the elemental form. You keep your intellect, wisdom, and charisma."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, then 18.","response":"DM: 18, Okay. You resist the blast of mental impact from the intellect devourer, now on the ground with its four feral legs, its brain form rippling. The second one is going to turn over here and saw the two shots, the one that took out Clarota. It turns up towards Percy, as you've lowered on the magic carpet, Percy. Go ahead and make an intellect saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Eight.\nSAM: Oh boy. That ain't no good.","response":"DM: You take 11 points of psychic damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: There's an “and” there, isn't there?\nSAM: And it's undone immediately.","response":"DM: And you take eight points of intellect damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, this is what happened to Grog!\nTRAVIS: You're better off than six, right?\nTALIESIN: Eight points of intellect damage. What does that mean, precisely?\nLIAM: Minus from your intelligence.\nSAM: You would know if you had more intellect.\nLAURA: Forever?","response":"DM: No, no, no, no. For this, it basically– what's your intelligence?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 16.","response":"DM: 16? Yeah, the blast hits you and you just shrug off the impact. It has to exceed your intelligence."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So do I still take eight more points of damage, though?","response":"DM: No, no no. You just the additional–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I just, I'm just going to go duh-duh.","response":"DM: Yeah, the intellect damage is not permanent."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I like purple.","response":"DM: Not quite that bad."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I can't not do it.\nSAM: Do we get out of here or do we try to kill these things?\nTRAVIS: Can you get us out of here?\nSAM: I can get some of us out of here.\nMARISHA: Start getting us out.\nSAM: Are we getting out or are we fighting?\nTRAVIS: Getting us out.\nMARISHA: Because we still have these fuckers we have to–\nASHLEY: Because Tiberius can get some of us out, right?\nLIAM: It's just the brains. Just the little brains.\nSAM: It's just the little brains. For now.","response":"DM: Make a perception check, by the way."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: For now, but people can beat through those doors. That's not a permanent thing.\nTALIESIN: We need 60 seconds to get out of here is what we need. We need 60 uninterrupted seconds.\nMARISHA: Well, we can start gathering our shit and packing up.\nTALIESIN: Oh, yeah.\nMARISHA: We can start packing up.\nSAM: Am I leaving or am I staying?\nTRAVIS: You do what you want.\nLIAM: Do what you want. It's chaos.","response":"DM: Swarming thing that drift up the sides of the temple from the floor. Coming from inside the temple and out toward the top."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should probably get out of here! They're coming up the sides!\nASHLEY: We can't get you out of here if you don't come–\nSAM: I run up to Pike. I grab her hand. I say, “I want to have babies with you.”\nSAM: Let's get out of here. (sings) So now I come to you with Dimension Door.\nASHLEY: Wait! Can I do a Mass Cure Wounds before we leave?\nSAM: And we get out.","response":"DM: You're still stunned from the Mind Blast. You haven't made your save."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We're going up to the top of the– to the thing. Just to the roof there.\nLAURA: They're coming up the sides!\nASHLEY: We've got to go somewhere else.\nORION: It's fine. It's good that they're up there.\nSAM: And, as a bonus, I'm going to send some inspiration to Grog.","response":"DM: Okay, as you Dimension Door you just go ahead and look back. Using the song of love you gave to Pike, you give back, give a wink to Grog. Grog, you take a 1d10 inspiration. 1d10 inspiration dice to you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay.\nLIAM: Grog, we would like you to rage.\nTRAVIS: I'm already there. I'm just being fucking grappled. Is it my turn?","response":"DM: It is now."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, can I try it for the third time to break free?","response":"DM: You can. Go ahead and go ahead and make your athletics."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Use that inspiration die, man.\nTRAVIS: I'll use the inspiration die just in case I rolled balls again.","response":"DM: Well, you can use it after you do it. See what you roll and then add it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's athletics, right?","response":"DM: Athletics, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 18.","response":"DM: 18?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on.","response":"DM: Yeah, you (boosh) break out of the creature's grasp. Suddenly it's reaching at you from behind the bars. You can see there's this slick, brackish oil on your body from where it was holding you. Fleshless arms clutching you to the bars."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So is everybody leaving? Should I climb up the rope?","response":"DM: There is Lady Kima who is turned to stone."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We've got to get Kima out.\nTRAVIS: Fuck Lady Kima!\nORION: Pick her up!\nLAURA: I thought you had a crush on her?\nASHLEY: Can he grab her and climb?","response":"DM: You can. She's not a big stone structure."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay, cool. I pick her up and start trying to climb up the rope.","response":"DM: Okay, so you rush, you grab the stone form."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Put her in the Bag of Holding!\nOTHERS: No!\nTRAVIS: She's stone! It doesn't matter!\nORION: Don't do that!\nTRAVIS: I take her and– oh, fine. I'll hold on to her.\nSAM: No, put her in the bag!\nMARISHA: Can you make one of those baby slings? Stuff her in your belt?\nTALIESIN: It's not time for arts and crafts.","response":"DM: You run up. You grab Lady Kima. You grab her in your arms and you rush. The rope is currently dangling from this side where you guys first came in."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Stomp all over the brain to get to it.","response":"DM: 50 speed. You can get up to here. You can just get up to the rope and we'll say as your dash action you can begin to climb, if you'd like."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would like to climb.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I would like to raise.\nTRAVIS: I would like to rage. Rage climb.","response":"DM: It gets you about there. Rage climbing like (grunts)."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes!","response":"DM: One-handed up the rope. That's pretty intense. Go ahead and make an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes. That Crossfit training come in handy.\nTRAVIS: 17.","response":"DM: 17. Yeah, it's sore. You know that arm is going to be dead tomorrow, but right now it doesn't even matter. You're just clutching Lady Kima, still locked in her attack pose, in one arm as you're overhand grabbing the rope and getting yourself up as fast as you can."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You better remember this when you wake up.","response":"DM: Rage-climbing up the rope."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He's climbing the Cliffs of Insanity!","response":"DM: That brings us to Vex."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I should just stay where I am, right guys?\nTALIESIN: And you should shoot things.\nLAURA: I'm going to do that, yes. Is there any other– there's just a little brain in there right now?","response":"DM: Right now there's two brains, and you can see just in the outskirts of the temple's side here, two more illithid that are making their way up the side of the temple."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, fuck me.","response":"DM: With about a hundred or so just now gathering towards the bottom of the temple base."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Jesus. We're going to get out of here real fast! You guys are listening to me, right? Because things are coming up the side and we need to get out of here.\nSAM: But what if there's gold down there to find?\nLAURA: I don't give a fuck! I'm going to Hunter's Mark a little brain. Or should I keep attacking the Elder Brain? What do you guys think?\nTALIESIN: Elder Brain is spilling out the side now, isn't it?","response":"DM: The Elder Brain is still inside, just the stonework on the outside of it is currently knocked out."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, I have a carpet anyway, so let's just jump on it.\nLIAM: I mean, it might get sent reeling, that brain.\nLAURA: I know, that's why I'm kind of like, hm.\nLIAM: Maybe if– we should try to get out of here, but maybe if we can frigging hurt that brain it'll stun them or send them reeling or something, or make them mad.\nLAURA: 27.","response":"DM: That'll hit. Releasing again, in midair you can see all the thorns appear out the sides of the arrow shaft. It explodes into a giant conical– just a ray, almost like a blizzard of thorns."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Get it.\nLAURA: I don't add– do I add Hunter's Mark to that damage, or just my regular and then that?","response":"DM: At the end of all the damage you dealt with the attack, you then add Hunter's Mark to that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nLIAM: Big money.\nLAURA: 22. 24.\nMARISHA: What's happening?\nLAURA: Oh, right, because you're right next to it, sorry Keyleth.\nMARISHA: Oh, it's okay. My reflex– I use my dex modifier for my elemental, correct?","response":"DM: Or deflect, yeah, sorry, old carryover, it's dexterity."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ten.","response":"DM: Ten? Versus your spell save of–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 14.","response":"DM: Yeah, so you take the same damage. You take 24 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sorry. Oh right, you're really, really strong.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I've got 100 hit points still.\nLAURA: Okay.\nMARISHA: So how many points? 21?\nMARISHA: Yeah, I'm good.\nLAURA: So I'll try to– I guess I'll just attack it again, because I've got nowhere else to go.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.\nLAURA: 17?\nLAURA: Oh really, with it oozing out and everything?","response":"DM: The second, there's some sort of psychic protective field in the brain. As you fire down, the arrow looks like it should strike and then it just arcs off to the side nonsensically, and then just splinters against the stonework next to the–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fudge!\nTRAVIS: Fudge.","response":"DM: You going to stay where you are? You going to move?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Get on Trinket!\nLAURA: I'm going to climb onto Trinket for some reason, because that makes sense.","response":"DM: Okay, you climb onto Trinket's back. That brings us to Keyleth. You're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, what's the situation with the brain soup?","response":"DM: The liquid is poured out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's like a jello mold of brains.\nMARISHA: Like a jello mold of a brain. And there's fluid coming out from underneath of it?","response":"DM: Yeah. Literally the fluid it was sitting in, it was mostly submerged in, is all now poured out onto the ground near you, beginning to get slick."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be like, phase under, phase down, and I'm going to get under where the brain would be, and I'm going to Superman punch it!\nLAURA: Yes!\nORION: Yeah!\nMARISHA: From underneath.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and make an attack roll."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Come on, punch it in its big brain anus.\nMARISHA: 23!","response":"DM: 23, that hits, go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, 22.\nMARISHA: Oh, 22! You're right, 22.\nMARISHA: Okay, that sounds fun.","response":"DM: So just roll and add your strength modifier of the earth elemental."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 14?","response":"DM: Okay, as you punch upward, you're still partially absorbed into the earth, but your fist comes through and it slams in, and you feel this sickening thud sound as your fist hits the interior of the brain. It still moves a little bit but it stays in its place held aloft by its own psychic defense mechanism. Make your second attack."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, yeah, same, 21.","response":"DM: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that one."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Big damage!\nMARISHA: Come on.\nTALIESIN: Big money.\nMARISHA: Oh, that's better. 16.","response":"DM: 16 damage. Go ahead and roll another strength check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Eight.","response":"DM: Eight? Okay. Once again, you slam your fist into it and you feel like the impact is absorbed partially by the psychic field around the brain. It holds itself in place. It's still not moving from within that small–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do I stay or do I get out?\nLAURA: Get out.\nORION: Get out.","response":"DM: You still have about– I'd say it only took you about 15 feet of movement to get underneath it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: In my burrowing speed, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So, I'm going to start burrowing up the side of the mountain– up the side of the temple, so I can pop out next to them.","response":"DM: Okay, so we'll say 25, 30, 35, 40, 45. What's your total burrow speed?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 60.","response":"DM: So you'll be about there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: So you're about as high as Tiberius is, partially up the wall."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm in the wall.\nLAURA: They won't see you.\nTRAVIS: Vax, you're still on the floor, right?\nLIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Up on there. As you glance in, you kinda have a brief look at the outside of the wall and on the opposite side there are two other mind flayers. One more coming up on the side and another troll behind it. And the troll's slamming onto the bricks you left up. And these two illithids are starting to look up and see you moving up, and their eyes go up and they can see the opening in the top of the– where the wall collapsed earlier. And they both look up and kinda start drifting up towards it. So that ends your turn. Tiberius, you're up."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What's the order after me?","response":"DM: Well, it's Percy, Pike, Vax, and then they go. Then Scanlan, Grog."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I was going to hold my turn to get everybody on the carpet.\nLIAM: I'm coming.\nORION: Okay, okay, good. I cast Fly at 5th level. I cast it on myself. I cast it on Grog. And I cast it on– you're not there.\nLAURA: Trinket!\nORION: Trinket. (groans)\nTRAVIS: She's on Trinket.\nLAURA: So I can fly if I'm on Trinket, right?\nORION: Yeah.\nLAURA: Sweet!\nORION: Me.","response":"DM: Yourself. Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I (flying noise).","response":"DM: What's the fly speed on that?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Um, outside?\nLIAM: A skillion.\nORION: I dunno, it's right here. It's right here.","response":"DM: It's on the card, the cards I gave you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: The cards! Look at the cards. It's 60 feet.","response":"DM: 60 feet. You make your way up top and you're now hovering. Trinket's now having another Peter Pan moment with you on his back awkwardly. It's just gotten used to flying on its own, that one time it had. Now it has an extra weight on its back. (bear noises)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You can do it, buddy. You can do it.\nASHLEY: You got it, Trink.\nORION: Oh wait, hold on– I want to turn to everybody and go, “Fly, you fools.”\nTALIESIN: I'm holding my turn.","response":"DM: You're holding back?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm holding my turn.","response":"DM: Okay. Percy, holding back. Pike, go ahead and make an intellect saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes!\nASHLEY: 19.","response":"DM: 19. You finally shrug off the effect of the Mind Blast. Your eyes clarify."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Does she fall in love with the first thing she sees?\nASHLEY: (gasps) Scanlan, are you hurt?\nSAM: I'm fine, baby. How are you?\nASHLEY: I'm great. Well, not really, but I'm just going to pretend I'm happy so that everybody can be okay.\nORION: That's right, Pike. Bury it deep inside.\nASHLEY: Well, can I do a spell? Okay, Mass Cure Wounds.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: For the, well, hold on a minute. How low is everybody? Not really that low?\nLAURA: Nobody's really low.\nTRAVIS: I'm at 32.\nASHLEY: He's pretty low.\nTALIESIN: You two are the only ones.\nLAURA: Yeah. Can you cast something on Kima? Oh, no. We should just keep her stone for now.\nSAM: You're low. You're super low.\nLAURA: Yeah, cast it on yourself, man.\nTRAVIS: Heal yourself.\nTALIESIN: She can hold this part of her turn until everybody's up there.","response":"DM: Mass Cure Wounds on yourself? Because Mass Cure Wounds is for multiple people."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: No, can I just do–","response":"DM: You can cast Cure Wounds on yourself."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I can?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: But he needs it, too.","response":"DM: It's your choice. It's also touch. You have to be next to him to do that."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Shit.\nTRAVIS: Just do your thing. You need it.","response":"DM: At six hit points, I'd recommend it to you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The DM recommends it.","response":"DM: You were so close to dying again. I was so scared."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I stringently urge you.\nLIAM: Four out of five DMs recommend.\nASHLEY: Now I'm at 23. Wait, so bonus action?\nORION: Get on the bear!\nLAURA: No, he can't–","response":"DM: You don't have to."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: He can “bear-ly” hold one.\nLAURA: Ba dum tss.\nASHLEY: I can't do that, right?","response":"DM: What?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I can't get on Trinket?","response":"DM: Right now, Trinket can barely hold Vex."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So as a bonus action, I'll give Scanlan a kiss on his cheek.\nSAM: Oh! Do I get an inspiration for that?","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm never going to wash it again.\nORION: You never wash it to begin with.","response":"DM: It's this strangely romantic moment as she reaches forward, grabs him and kisses him on the cheek and pulls away and he looks at her with this beautiful smile, and then the sound effects kick in again, of the bats screeching ahead and the (inhales) of all the illithid swarming up the side of the temple."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh god, we're still in a war zone!\nASHLEY: Oh no, we got to get it together.\nLIAM: Okay, I run up the dais, land on the brain. I'm on my way, but before I go, I'm going to kiss you goodbye. Dagger, dagger, dagger. Stabbing into the brain before I leap onto the carpet. So here I go. First one– misses. Second one is a 25.","response":"DM: 25, okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Which gets nine damage.\nLIAM: And last dagger is a 13.","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so I'll give him a little cut, a little nick, and then jump on the flying carpet.\nLIAM: And I grab Percy around the neck and kiss him on the cheek, and say, “Let's get out of here, you bastard.”\nTALIESIN: Do I get an inspiration point for that?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's a double standard.\nTALIESIN: You know how I feel about you.\nLIAM: Fight the patriarchy.","response":"DM: Down the road, maybe. This is the start of something beautiful."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm feeling something new.","response":"DM: Let the seeds germinate for a while. Then the dice may come naturally. So you're holding your turn? Percy, you want to go now?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I want to go now.\nTALIESIN: I'm just going to reel straight up. And on my way up, I'm going to take two more shots at the brain.","response":"DM: Okay, okay. We'll say here for the purposes of this. Taking two more shots?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 16.\nLIAM: Oh, I'm suffocating in the brain!","response":"DM: Oh no, it's fallen over. What's the first roll?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 16.","response":"DM: 16 does hit. Oh, it's not even flat, okay. We're just going to put it down there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And 19.","response":"DM: 16 doesn't hit. The 19 just barely hits it. It pierces through the psychic barrier. (zoomf) The bullet sinking again into the fleshy membrane."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The second one has a bonus die, yay.","response":"DM: Ice shot."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ice shot.\nMARISHA: Maybe you'll freeze it.\nLIAM: Percy and Vax, ship it!\nTALIESIN: That's 13 points plus two points of ice damage.\nLIAM: Oh dear.\nTALIESIN: Can we go up there? Can you put us at our height now?\nMARISHA: Can you represent us accurately?","response":"DM: So at a 30-foot radius, which you guys are, it gives off a pulse of energy, (boomf) this giant psychic burst of purple-ish, psychic blast just cascades out of the center and just fills the room for a second with this large dull thud-like “thoom” sound. All of you instinctively look down and see this explosion that just dissipates as it crests the bottom of the magic carpet, which is just out of range."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You're wearing the helmet, at least.","response":"DM: At which point, you guys who are at the top, looking off to the side, all the illithid that are rushing up the tunnel, there's a sudden flash of purple energy in their eyes simultaneously. Like now the Elder Brain has come back online and has reconnected with its people."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Out, out, out!\nTRAVIS: I can keep flying up?","response":"DM: All of the sudden, the rope is really easy to go up. It's nothing, you're just going hand over hand."}
{"prompt":"ORION: You can fly, Grog!\nTRAVIS: I have one more level three, whatever it's called, level three healing potion. They're called superior or something? What's the word for it?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'd like to take that.\nMARISHA: I have so much adrenaline during these kind of fights.\nTALIESIN: I know.","response":"DM: They're moving around, they're angry, they can't quite get to their targets."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I heal 24 points of hit damage.","response":"DM: Fantastic. Rolling for the bottom of the attack round. Okay. The troll bursts through the door, filling in with the two mind flayers behind it. They both look up, frustrated. And both begin to drift up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No!","response":"DM: As far as they can get."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Fuck this house of horrors.\nASHLEY: How do we get out of here?\nLAURA: How are we going to get out of here?","response":"DM: Both of you guys make intellect saving throws again."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm just looking into her eyes the whole time.\nASHLEY: Can you sing?\nMARISHA: You've got that inspiration die.\nSAM: Oh, I do. I don't need it though.","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm at 20.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 14.\nSAM: Can I sing for her?\nLAURA: Good thing you healed yourself, Pike!","response":"DM: Damn good thing you healed yourself."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She was at 23! That's 22. That's one point!\nLAURA: Yeah. That's the second time this round.","response":"DM: You feel all of the sudden, the blast hits you and you see her eyes roll back in her head as she reaches up and grabs the side of her head again, nearly dropping her shield and mace, which you manage to catch before they clatter down into the temple."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.\nSAM: Baby, come on.\nASHLEY: Maybe we'll be okay?\nMARISHA: Do you want some more dice?\nMARISHA: Take it, take it. Give it to her, please.\nORION: Head to the beach!\nSAM: Wait, top of the round?","response":"DM: Yeah, we're at the very top now. At the very end, the new guys burst in and attacked."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to– (sighs) Is that brain fluid still floating around it? Like, out and stuff?\nTRAVIS: Well, we woke it up.\nLAURA: I know.\nLIAM: But now it's awake, so–","response":"DM: Percy shot– No, actually, you didn't do your turn on that one. I'm sorry, I think we skipped Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Should I kill the brain, or try to kill the brain?\nLIAM: If you can also flee at the same time.\nORION: Well, he has to wait for the carpet.\nSAM: The brain is down there in the puddle? In the pool? Is that big scaffolding still hanging over it?","response":"DM: It's currently dangling over to this side. Because it's been busted from three different corners and it's precariously hanging."}
{"prompt":"SAM: But it's not right over the thing?\nLAURA: But it might fall and tip.\nSAM: Or it could not.\nASHLEY: Could somebody also use Telekinesis to pull it to fall the other way?\nORION: I do not have the necessary item to do two concentration spells at once.\nSAM: Is it super heavy?","response":"DM: It's pretty heavy. It probably weighs close to 700 to 1,000 pounds."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What does?","response":"DM: The giant brass structure."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And how high above it is it? Like, would it get a significant amount of force?","response":"DM: It would fall down and then topple over."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Unless I made it fall–","response":"DM: Unless you made it fall. In that case, we'll see."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I do that or do I just Lightning Strike? Okay.\nLIAM: It's your decision.\nMARISHA: Go bold!\nTRAVIS: Do what you were going to do. Do it.\nSAM: I'm feeling handsy.\nSAM: (sings) Bigby's Hand! So I take Bigby's Hand and I sort of try to wrench it off the last thing that's holding it up, but in the direction of the–","response":"DM: Okay!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Of the brain.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a roll, adding your plus five for your casting ability."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, that's not good.\nORION: And inspiration!\nSAM: Oh, yeah! Okay, so that makes it 13 plus what?","response":"DM: 13 plus five, which is your charisma."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, then 18.","response":"DM: 18. As the spectral Bigby's Hand reaches over and grabs the top of the structure, you can see the weird bit of bent metal that was once part of the mostly-destroyed structure that held it aloft in the center of the temple (metal creaking) wrenches forth and snaps as the entire structure begins to be pulled at an angle."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (sings) It's Bigby's Hand.","response":"DM: It slams down at an angle into the side of the brain and coming to rest on top, crushing even further the corpse of Clarota, currently smeared across the ground. Oh, man. Go ahead and roll 6d6 force damage on that. Crushing damage, as this heavy thing jams itself into the brain."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Six cubes, Sam, six cubes.\nSAM: Orion's my dice bimbo.\nORION: Here you go, boss.\nASHLEY: There you go, boss!\nSAM: 16.","response":"DM: 16, so the structure slams into the Elder Brain, and you can see like a bit of purplish black liquid kinda squirts out to one side and for the first time you can see a part of the brain is actually torn open, and the purplish glow that you see throbbing in the middle of its folds is now visible from the interior. You can see now, it's taken some real damage. Immediately the two mind flayers that were floating up look down, freaked out, and begin moving towards the brain now, instinctively, to defend it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And bonus action, can I pour some superior healing potion down Pike's beautiful throat?","response":"DM: You can."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, no.\nSAM: I'm just pouring my potion down Pike's throat.\nSAM: I don't know what superior is.","response":"DM: Oh, it's a superior one, superior goes to, it's 8d4 plus eight."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I roll or does she?","response":"DM: You roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh!","response":"DM: It's your potion."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 8d4 plus eight.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Holy bajeez. One.","response":"DM: Five, nine, 13."}
{"prompt":"SAM and MATT: 15, 18, 21.","response":"DM: One more."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 22.","response":"DM: Plus eight, 30. You heal 30 hit points."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What? Awesome.\nSAM: I got some good potion.\nLAURA: I want to attack the Elder Brain.","response":"DM: Okay. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to– I think all I can do is a Conjure Barrage.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So it's the cone of attack.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So that will get hopefully all the things, because I'm shooting down, right?","response":"DM: Well, how big is the cone?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's 60 feet.","response":"DM: 60-foot cone from your angle here, if you're going for the brain it'll catch this guy, maybe, as a cone that goes down this way."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: Unless you want to go this way and hit these guys, or this guy."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You could get the edge of the brain.\nLAURA: Yeah, can I do the edge on the brain and get–","response":"DM: Yeah. You can get, you can get probably these guys there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: So they get saving throws, right? How does that work?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, they get saving throws.","response":"DM: So roll damage, and we'll see what their saving throws are."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. But do I have to roll to see if it hits, or it just hits?","response":"DM: No, for that one, it's just a barrage and they get to roll a saving throw against it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Okay, cool. 17?\nLAURA: Plus Hunter's Mark? On the Elder Brain.","response":"DM: Yeah, so the Elder Brain takes additional damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Three additional. Do I get plus two for the bracers on that Conjure Barrage?","response":"DM: Technically, yes you would, because they're ranged."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, so that would've been 19.\nLAURA: 19.","response":"DM: 19 on him? Okay. So it's still alive, just looking really, really rough. The brain's just now pierced with a bunch of arrows, some of it, it's barely holding itself on top of its feet. And the troll also takes the damage as well, just seems to shrug it off, just seems to angrily– roars up from the bottom of the temple at you, now seemingly helpless in the current circumstance."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So then I want to attack the Elder Brain again.\nLAURA: 20.","response":"DM: Very nice, that hits, go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, wait, wait! No, lies! 13.","response":"DM: 13, okay, there we go."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ooh! I took notice of this.","response":"DM: That brings us to Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to take the rest of my burrow speed to get up to the top.\nMARISHA: I'm assuming I'm there?","response":"DM: You just manage to make it to the top of the temple, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Drop earth elemental.\nMARISHA: Would you say–\nSAM: Oh boy.","response":"DM: Nothing good ever comes out of this. What do you got, Keyleth, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Theoretically.","response":"DM: Theoretically?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Our brains are made up of water, right? Would you say that there is water in the like jello brain mold, like water molecules would be in it?","response":"DM: Make an arcana check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. I don't know much in terms of arcana, but I can try. Ten.","response":"DM: You have no idea. You have never encountered an Elder Brain before."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, give it a try!\nTALIESIN: Give it a try!\nMARISHA: Okay. I'm going to cast Control Water. I'm going to assume that there's water, it's 300 feet, I got the range and I'm going to take the brain where it's already kind of sliced down the middle where Vex has already made progress, I'm going to take it and I'm just going to rip it apart.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier to it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Wait, you're saying brains are made of water?\nTALIESIN: Whoa!\nMARISHA: 23.","response":"DM: Okay. There is an element of liquid to its structure, however it is difficult to extract it from a form that you're unfamiliar with, let alone one that's this stable. You manage to find a way to pull moisture out of parts of it and actually deal damage to it as you're beginning to shrivel sections of the brain. Go ahead and roll 3d6. You do 3d6 points of dehydration damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'll take it, I'll take it.\nASHLEY: Make some brain jerky.\nMARISHA: They'll have a really bad hangover tomorrow.","response":"DM: Oh yeah. Oh, you don't even know the half of it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ooh! Just 3d6 or plus anything?","response":"DM: Just 3d6."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 15.\nASHLEY: Awesome.\nLAURA: Gross.\nMARISHA: Cool.\nMARISHA: Scanlan, smell it! Smell it!\nSAM: No, thank you.","response":"DM: Tiberius, you're up."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Did you say there was illithid coming up on the sides, too?","response":"DM: Yeah, they're swarming up the side. They're probably about halfway up."}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, I'm up top. I have Fly on myself.\nORION: Yeah, I just let a Fireball down on the brain.\nTRAVIS: Crush the nuts.\nASHLEY: Little brains.","response":"DM: I like that, good."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 40.","response":"DM: 40?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Whoa!\nASHLEY: Yeah!","response":"DM: Those incinerate. And 40 points of damage to the Elder Brain as this giant echoing explosion blasts up from below. All of you at the top, you are underlit momentarily from the flash of red and yellow flame. As you look down, there's now a sizzling sound and this like smell of horrible burnt flesh as part of the Elder Brain now that was originally dehydrated is now also burnt and singed. You can see now, it's looking a little rougher and it's very very unhappy with its current circumstance."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I want to kill it before we leave now.\nMARISHA: Come on, Pike!\nLAURA: Why a saving throw?","response":"DM: Still trying to get rid of the stun."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, right.","response":"DM: So intellect saving throw."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 16?","response":"DM: 16. You shrug off the effect–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah! Man. Thanks, Keyleth. Much better now.\nMARISHA: New dice!\nSAM: What? I've been doing it wrong this whole time.\nASHLEY: Can I do anything, or that's my turn?","response":"DM: That's your turn."}
{"prompt":"ORION: My movement, by the way is I head to the beach.\nSAM: You're ghosting?\nORION: Yes.","response":"DM: You just get the fuck out of Dodge, Tiberius is that way."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wait, where do we go? Nobody's taking us?\nLAURA: No, you've got to hop on the carpet when it comes up.\nASHLEY: Oh, okay, got it.\nMARISHA: Classic Tiberius.","response":"DM: Vax?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: As long as I'm thinking about it.\nLIAM: Well I'm still sitting, still kneeling on the flying carpet with Percy, so I'm just throwing daggers at the bacon brain.","response":"DM: Okay. They're at disadvantage at this distance."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. So that means, aw man, 17 on the first.","response":"DM: 17? (ricochet sound) Reflected, deflected by the arcane shield on the brain."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Take the wheel!","response":"DM: As it gets more and more damaged, it's waking up more and more and it looks like it's actually gaining power the more it does."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, and then Percy yelled in my ear, so I take some of the little carpet tassels.\nLAURA: Grab the gnomes!","response":"DM: This right here. You guys are all looking precariously at this carpet that is now floating up from the center of the temple. As you get to the top, you look over and you can see there's probably close to 20 mind flayers that are swarming up the side. That brings us to, Vax, Percy, you're up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hanging brain!\nTALIESIN: And I'm taking a shot straight down.","response":"DM: Okay. I'll say it takes you your–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: My movement.","response":"DM: Movement to get it out. So you're there, you're unable to move the carpet, you pull the Bad News out, you get down, you're precariously off the side of it, and it is sagging as your weight touches it, you get ready, go ahead and fire."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Firing a deadshot.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, come on.\nTALIESIN: That's 18.","response":"DM: As you fire, the blast sends you up almost onto your feet on the carpet again, and you hear this impact sound, this (crash) of the blast hitting stone as the psychic field around it deflects the bullet, sending it into the ground."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I thought 18 was the number that we were aiming for– shit.\nTALIESIN: Wait, did I have an inspiration dice from last– fuck.\nORION: You did.\nTALIESIN: I did have an inspiration dice from last game! I did! What do you give people with it?\nSAM: d10.\nTALIESIN: d10? Oh fuck, that's right.\nORION: Can he add it now?","response":"DM: Yeah, I'll trust you on that."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I did! I did, because I'm always excited when I get them, because I never get them.\nTALIESIN: 21!","response":"DM: That'll do it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh my god.","response":"DM: As the brain continues to wake up, it improves its defenses, improves its capabilities–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I understand.\nTALIESIN: Okay.","response":"DM: But that will hit. So go ahead and roll damage on that."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay.\nORION: It's Hulking?","response":"DM: Essentially. So as you release the blast, it hits the psychic field, the first impact you hear is it hitting the psychic field and pushing through into the actual brain matter."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Come on!\nTALIESIN: Let me double-check that I'm doing this right, hold on, deadshot's weird. Plus weapon damage. Okay, so that's eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13… 25 points of damage.","response":"DM: 25 points of damage. Boom! You see the section of it that's kinda charred and burned gets blown off, and now there's a corner of the brain that's just an open and gaping wound. The purplish glow on the inside is pulsing more and more angrily. It's taken a beating, but it's hanging in there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh my god!\nMARISHA: Will not die.","response":"DM: This is, you guys have left a good mark on it. You get the sensation, with the swarming incoming, you may start to consider self-preservation, because the Elder Brain looks like it's taken some hits, but it's not on death's door yet."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh god.\nMARISHA: Let's get out.\nLAURA: We need to go.","response":"DM: Scanlan, you're up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Scanlan is up?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We're out of here?\nTALIESIN: We need everybody to hop on the carpet first.\nSAM: Okay.","response":"DM: You're hopping up?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, I'm going to turn into a huge pterodactyl and carry some folks.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What?\nLAURA: You can do that?\nSAM: Sure, why not?\nMARISHA: He's got Polymorph.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, turn into a batwing.","response":"DM: Cool, so we'll say for the time being, we'll use this as Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Great.","response":"DM: You are a giant pterodactyl, a creature that you've read in books in the past, you haven't actually seen in person. And what are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Who can I carry?","response":"DM: You can carry one person with your claws. You haven't used this form before, and this is you figuring it out, so pick one and you can take them with you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to take someone heavy.\nLIAM: Grog.","response":"DM: Grog can fly."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I can fly on Trinket, yeah, everybody's covered, man.\nSAM: There's only one person I can take.","response":"DM: As the pterodactyl Scanlan swoops down and both its claws grapple on your arms and lift you off the top of the temple, flying after Tiberius."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How do you make that weird?\nTRAVIS: We're getting out, right?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: So I don't have to worry, so up and out.","response":"DM: So you just awkwardly fly with Kima under your arm, off with the rest of the group."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (sings) Sweet bird of prey, fly, fly away.\nSAM: (sings) Up, up, and away, I'm a beautiful pterodactyl.","response":"DM: We'll get these guys off the board here because you do have two Illithid that get up to the edge here. They're going to attempt a Mind Blast."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're gone, man, we're gone!\nLAURA: Not yet.","response":"DM: Still holding back. So–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I jump up to get out of range.","response":"DM: That can just get Trinket and Vex, if you can go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw for both of you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Don't fuck with my sister.\nORION: Trinket and Vex are still there?\nLAURA: Yeah. I know, I didn't get to–\nSAM: They never flew.\nLAURA: I know, I didn't use the movement on the last turn.","response":"DM: Nope."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I just didn't say it because I'm an asshole.\nSAM: You are.\nLIAM: What kind of saving throw?\nMATT and SAM: Intelligence.\nLAURA: Ten? On me.","response":"DM: Okay. Roll for Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You rolled nine, plus two is 11.\nLAURA: Oh. Okay. 11.","response":"DM: So go ahead and roll for Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! I rolled a nine, plus two, plus two.\nLIAM: For what?\nLAURA: For my ring that I'm wearing.\nLIAM: Okay.\nLAURA: So whatever that was.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and LIAM: 13.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: For me.","response":"DM: And roll for Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Which is going to be a major fail because Trinket is the dumbest.\nSAM: Don't talk about Trinket like that.\nTRAVIS: Is he the dumbest?\nLAURA: No, that's a minus four. So that would be a nine for Trinket.","response":"DM: Nine for Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Who is, by the way, my only way to get out of here right now.","response":"DM: So communally, both you and Trinket freeze in place, and Trinket, who is flying, slumps onto the top of the temple, limply laying across the edge, about to tip over off the temple."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (whispering) Told you we should've left Trinket behind.","response":"DM: That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nLIAM: A lot of Sandmen in there.\nMARISHA: Well first and foremost I'm going to get on the carpet.","response":"DM: Okay. So you leap up here with these guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Secondly, I am going to– Okay, wait, Trinket's stunned?","response":"DM: Trinket is currently catatonic (moans), just barely holding herself right there. You can see she's struggling with the flight spell, like she's kind of levering herself into the ground–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket's a boy.","response":"DM: Him, sorry. I was thinking of you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: If he's about to die, at least get his gender right.","response":"DM: I apologize, Trinket. I'm sorry."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, shove him?\nTALIESIN: Shove him onto the carpet.\nMARISHA: No, I can't shove him.\nSAM: Wait, he's floating.\nMARISHA: Okay, can I do this? Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm on the carpet. I'm going to cast Grasping Vine from the carpet and wrap around Trinket and have a Trinket tow vine.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Like the Macy's Day parade!","response":"DM: So as you leap onto the carpet, you reach down, and the fibrous nature that the carpet was originally made from, you manage to pull the essence of that out to create a vine of similarly patterned color of the actual magic carpet material. The various silks form into this tendril that wraps around both you and Trinket and pulls you guys hanging behind the carpet, so you guys are essentially now towed to the carpet."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Let's go!\nORION: Can she take control of the carpet, too?\nMARISHA: Can I now use the rest of my movement to be like–","response":"DM: You currently do not have control of the carpet because you used your action and everything to use that spell and your concentration at that point."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I'm just holding.","response":"DM: You're just holding them there. That brings us to Tiberius, you're off, flying off. Pike is off, Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm steering us the fuck outta here, man.","response":"DM: You tow Trinket and Vex out behind. As you guys pull off at full speed, the rest of the illithid swarm to the top, you can see about 15 or so get to the front top here, look down at the Elder Brain, look up at the rest of you with this angry look, and as you're pulling away, your eyes adjust to the darkness of the cavern and you look down and you swear you can see hundreds and hundreds of sets of purple glowing eyes just staring up from the city as you all slowly fly away to the far end of the cavern. As you're moving, so are the eyes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (sings) We've made some enemies. They're coming after us.\nORION: I want to make a note, because I'm way ahead of everybody at this point, as soon as I land on the beach, I cast Circle of Teleportation.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Barring that there's nobody there, but I do that immediately.","response":"DM: As Tiberius, you land on the dirt. You land, immediately begin casting the Circle of Teleportation, you begin scrawling this circle on the ground, running your finger across the gravel surface to build the runes. As your fingers drag across, you can see the arcane light beginning to glow and form the sigils and the runes as you're drawing them feverishly. The rest of the group eventually catches up to you about 30 seconds into it. As you all eventually get back, you and Trinket manage to shrug off the effect. And you find yourselves halfway through being towed by this vine awkwardly."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What is happening right now?\nMARISHA: Stupid wrench.","response":"DM: A few seconds pass, you finish the incantation, you place your hand down on the center of the sigil, this wave of arcane energy blasts off, and suddenly, above this circle, this tearing sound pulls out of the middle of the ether, and this kind of purple shimmering doorway opens above the circle sigil that he crafted on the side of the beach."}
{"prompt":"ORION: By the blessings of Bahamut, I choose Emon!","response":"DM: At which point, the doorway that he just created takes some sort of a solid form and from what you can see on the other side, there appears to be some sort of low-lit room."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Greyskull!\nLAURA: (gasps) Greyskull!\nORION: I run right through.\nALL: Yes!\nSAM: Are we there?","response":"DM: You guys have all landed on the beach as he finished casting this, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Run!\nMARISHA: Run!","response":"DM: You all rush through the portal, one after the other, towards the very end is Grog, you bringing up the rear, holding Kima, you go rushing towards it as it begins to slowly close, this only lasts a round, you barrel through just in time as it closes behind you with a sparking sound."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We are time bandits.\nTRAVIS: Oh, fuck. I just caked my pants.\nTALIESIN: Squish-squish.\nLAURA: I hate that phrase.\nORION: That was something, now, wasn't it?\nTALIESIN: That was fantastic.\nTRAVIS: Chocolate cake.","response":"DM: You all emerge within a small 20-foot-by-20-foot white stone chamber. You all are kinda crammed in this space currently, but you are all apparently safe and sound. As the doorway closes behind you, you turn and look, and on the ground there is a similar circle across the stone flooring, different patterns, different, you know, arrangement to the one that he had drawn, but with some similarities that are kind of a reminiscent glow, almost like a code to this circle, fade away, based on what he had drawn previously."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They won't be able to open that back up?\nORION: We are safe.\nLAURA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Just a quick request: she is made of stone. Holding Lady Kima.\nASHLEY: Yes! I'll go over and cast Greater Restoration on Kima.\nORION: Hold on just one second.\nTRAVIS: Hold on.\nORION: We still have the Horn to deal with.\nTALIESIN: The Horn is on the carpet. It has been specifically not touched.","response":"DM: So it's just kind of sitting there. The carpet's bunched to the side now as you guys kind of flew into the portal and kind of left it there and the Horn's just resting there."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I think we should get it out of her view before–\nTALIESIN: I think we should put it in the Bag of Holding.\nTRAVIS: Sure, yeah. Do you want to teleport it in the bag?\nASHLEY: If your crushing couldn't kill it, the thousand pounds?\nORION: We can store it there.\nLIAM: Where are we? You said we're in a room.","response":"DM: It's a small yellow room, sorry, a small white stone room and there is a kind of yellowish brown stone doorway that is closed. There's some very faint white orbs that are locked into the wall. So you're not in Greyskull Keep now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, we're not in Greyskull.","response":"DM: You guys don't have a teleportation circle installed in your Keep yet. You don't know where you are."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We're in a room right now?","response":"DM: You're in a room, you're in a 20-foot-by-20-foot room, with two small white orbs on the sides that are kinda set into the walls to give off a faint white arcane glow. There's a single doorway that exits the room that is currently closed."}
{"prompt":"ORION: The way Circle of Teleportation works is when I learned it I get to pick two locations that I know innately. I picked Emon as one of them.\nLAURA: Oh, okay. Okay.\nMARISHA: So we're somewhere in Emon.\nORION: But I just had to pick the two.\nMARISHA: So we could be in someone's living room right now?\nORION: I'll use Telekinesis to lift the Horn off the carpet.","response":"DM: Okay. You still have the spells?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, I can burn one from my Ioun stone.\nLAURA: Should we wrap it at all?\nTALIESIN: It'll be fine in the Bag of Holding.\nLIAM: Not knowing what else to do, Vax is going to go to the door and just inspect it, see if it's trapped.","response":"DM: Roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 24.\nLIAM: Not trapped. Okay, I'll get to work on it, then. 32.","response":"DM: Okay, 32. You, relatively easy, the door comes unlocked, the small, it's like a very very intricately carved brass handle that has swirls upon it, like it's almost like a burst of wind being blown and frozen in gold. You turn it and the door opens slightly."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Pull up, I'm still wearing my tin hat and I pull up my hood from my elven cloak, and I go stealth. And I am stealthed, because that's a 32. And I have a look around outside the door.","response":"DM: Okay. As you open the doorway, it leads into a secondary chamber. This is an 80-foot-diameter circular chamber now, so you're entering the edge of a giant circle. There are a series of other doors, almost in respective rows next to each other, and you also see, in the center of the room, a vibrant chandelier made of white crystal like the spheres you saw in the previous room you were in, giving off a warm, atmospheric glow to the entire room. In the center of the room, there is a semi-circle desk that is also made of a similar white stone material that the rest of the room is made out of, with polished gold leaf trimming on the edge, and you do see what looks to be an elven man sitting at the desk, longish gray-white hair, he's wearing robes that are finely dressed, and he's half-falling asleep at a desk with a series of books kind of piled up on the side. As soon as the doorway opens, he looks up, and you hear a slight little arcane tinging sound, like a little bell being rung, as you open the door. He looks up for a second."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Say hello.\nLIAM: Yes yes yes. I just walk forward and pull down the cloak and say, “Hello.”","response":"DM: “Stay right where you are! Do not move!”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hands up in the air.","response":"DM: “Do not move!”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Nothing in them. No threat, no danger here. A little lost, apparently.","response":"DM: “Apparently.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: “Who else is in, who else goes there? Who else, please, step outside! Reveal yourselves!”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: They're–\nLAURA: Hi!\nMARISHA: Hi.\nASHLEY: Hello.\nSAM: (pterodactyl screech)","response":"DM: As soon as he sees you, he goes, (screams)."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I cast Dispel Magic on Scanlan.\nSAM: Do you have it anymore?\nORION: Yeah, I do.\nSAM: You just did it to me earlier in this round.\nORION: No, Counterspell, and I Silenced you, this is Dispel Magic, which ends your spell.\nSAM: Oh. Hello.","response":"DM: So as you cast the spell and transform, he stops in the middle of casting a spell reflexively and goes, “Oh. And a bear. Interesting.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: He's friendly.\nSAM: He's real.\nLIAM: I have a very long, very strange story, every word of which is true, and if you will give me five minutes, I swear I can convince you–","response":"DM: He opens a book and starts thumbing through the pages."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No ill intent. Intent? Yes.","response":"DM: “We have no expected arrivals at this hour. I need to know your business, your names, and your affiliations immediately.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We will totally do that when we know–\nLAURA: We are affiliated with the king.\nLIAM: Yeah, emperor. Just tell the emperor that Vox Machina has returned from Kraghammer, and we have news for him, and–","response":"DM: “Well.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We were on very secret business for the crown, actually. And that is why you weren't informed of our business.\nORION: Yeah, I'm Tiberius Stormwind. How are you?","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Did you wink?\nORION: I'm responsible for casting the spell to get us here to begin with.\nLIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: That would be a 20– no. 35.\nLAURA: That's not possible. 25.","response":"DM: 25."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Gatekeeper?","response":"DM: “Here within the Lyceum. The hour is late. We are two hours past midnight.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well, I am Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, and, hello, and we would love to report to the emperor of your great hospitality at this unfortunately early hour, and we would look forward to reporting of all of your kindness and good housekeeping.\nLIAM: I imagine he would be very upset if we were delayed. We come with very grave news.\nTALIESIN: I would hope not to imagine it.","response":"DM: “Well. I'm certain the Headmaster would like to know your business in the morning.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: “Headmaster Thurmond. He runs this Alabaster Lyceum within the Erudite Quarter. If you would please submit a report for your reasons for using the Lyceum Junction property by tomorrow, I'm sure that would suffice for the required paperwork.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course we will.\nTALIESIN: You are too kind.\nLAURA: In the meantime, we'll just go to our Keep that we have in town.\nORION: Greyskull Keep.","response":"DM: Gives you a very, a disbelieving look and kinda goes, “Very well.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Good day, good evening.\nSAM: I cast Friends on him and I tell him, “You know of our Keep, don't you?”","response":"DM: Okay. He goes, “I seem to recall hearing about a Vox Machina at some point discussed, but I don't get out very often. Running the graveyard shift here at the Lyceum has taken its toll on my social life.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You poor thing, you should get out more.","response":"DM: “Well here, let me show you out.” And he walks you through the rest of the hallways. It's a beautiful, beautiful kind of domed center chamber into a long series of white stone hallways, similar material to what the first room you arrived in looked like. Eventually to a main foyer area, which has a very high ceiling and a series of beautifully carved pillars that show different creatures, almost like devas and demons battling each other as they spiral up these pillars, to the front doorways. There are two guards that are adorned in kinda silver and gold armor with these very high, elven in design-shaped helmets, and they step to the side as the doors open on their own."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Love the hat.\nLAURA: Of course.\nSAM: Oh, one more question before you leave, what district are we in right now?","response":"DM: “The Erudite Quarter.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thank you.\nTRAVIS: Gesundheit.","response":"DM: “Good night.” The doors slam (boof) behind you as you guys exit, and you're now–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Holy shit, we survived! What was that?\nMARISHA: Oh my god! Keyleth just goes down on her knees and starts kissing the ground.\nTALIESIN: Well, that could've gone worse.\nMARISHA: Oh, we're home.\nASHLEY: I just want to get in my bed so bad.\nMARISHA: Look! Stars!","response":"DM: You look up and, for the first time in close to a week, you can see stars, you can see a crescent moon, probably just past its single quarter phase. It is a sight for sore eyes right now."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm so happy.\nTRAVIS: Would you say it's a beautiful sight?","response":"DM: Currently? The most beautiful night sky you've seen in all of your years."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I ruin it with a fart.\nORION: I'm glad you held that the whole time we were down there, Grog.\nTRAVIS: I've had horrible stomach pains this whole time, I'm sorry.\nLAURA: What, are we just carrying around this stone Kima with us, or are we taking her back to our–\nLIAM: Yes, but don't stand right in front of her when you undo the stone.\nORION: Actually, hold on a minute, let's all rest before we deal with this one.\nTRAVIS: Yes.\nASHLEY: No, because I want to be able to have an extra 5th-level spell.\nTRAVIS: Oh, right.\nLAURA: But we're in town now, so we're safe.\nASHLEY: Yeah, let's go to the Keep.\nLAURA: Yeah, so it'll be fine.\nASHLEY: Yeah.\nSAM: It's a long way. We've got to go across the whole town to get there.\nLAURA: Well, we've got a fucking flying carpet.\nSAM: We do have a flying carpet.\nTALIESIN: The metro's running at this hour.\nLIAM: We can probably flag down a wagon, too.\nLAURA: Yeah, we're in town!\nLIAM: Yeah.\nLAURA: Fuck it. Everything's possible.\nTALIESIN: Let's go drinking.\nMARISHA: I was going to say, what bars are open?\nLIAM: We've got a lot of bling and a cursed Horn. The sky's the limit.\nASHLEY: I know, should we go to a tavern and get some ale?\nSAM: What, who are you?\nTRAVIS: Really? You mean it?\nASHLEY: Well what do you mean, do I mean it?\nTRAVIS: It's all empty, can we fill it please?\nASHLEY: It's all empty?\nMARISHA: We should get some ale. Wait, maybe we should drop off the Bag of Holding so we're not carrying it around.\nTRAVIS: And the stone gnome.\nMARISHA: And then go out drinking.\nLIAM: We don't want to lose it in a game of cards.\nMARISHA: Yes, exactly. Exactly.\nTRAVIS: And stone Kima.\nSAM: We'll be fine, we've never lost it before. There's eight of us, we'll be fine, let's go drinking.\nASHLEY: How far is the Keep from here?","response":"DM: I'd say it's probably a good hour walk."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, we've got time.\nTALIESIN: We could do a pub crawl, we'll just have a beer at every pub we hit on the way back to the Keep.\nMARISHA: Yes, let's do that! Pub crawl!\nALL: Pub crawl!\nMARISHA: We're going to pub crawl back to the Keep.\nLIAM: Starting here at Geek & Sundry.\nASHLEY: But should I go just in a bush just behind and–\nSAM: Do you have to pee or something?\nASHLEY: No, and cast Greater Restoration on Kima?\nALL: No!\nSAM: We want to enjoy this.\nORION: She doesn't have a sense of time, she won't know.\nSAM: Or humor.\nTRAVIS: Let's put her in the bag. She's made of stone!\nLAURA: We won't tell her how much time has passed.\nTALIESIN: We'll un-stone her once we're back at the Keep.\nTRAVIS: She's stone. Stone doesn't breathe. Right?\nTALIESIN: It'll be fine.\nSAM: We don't know.\nLAURA: Do not put her in the Bag of Holding! Do not.\nLIAM: For the record, I think she'd be fine, too. But we could bring her around and introduce her; it could be like Weekend at Bernie's.\nTRAVIS: Ah, yes! I put a fancy robe around Kima's stone statue.\nLAURA: This is so messed up.\nTRAVIS: We lived!\nMARISHA: We lived!","response":"DM: Holy shit, guys."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I was fine.","response":"DM: Welcome back. We got a little refresher here and apparently our Overlord has an announcement."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: You guys, we're only four away from another giveaway, which is–\nLUCAS: Two away!\nZAC: Two away, you know what, I'm guessing this is, we're going to get that before I even get back to my seat, so we're going to go do the giveaway. It's the shirt, the dice, the handbook, and the starter set. The handbook and the shirt will be signed by the cast.","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: And we still have, if we get to 400, correct, next? Lucas?\nLUCAS: Yeah. 3,400.","response":"DM: 3,400."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh wait, this is in here. Can I throw this? Oh no.","response":"DM: Pass it off, it's fine."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You get the horn.\nLAURA: Can I hold it for a second?\nTRAVIS: No.\nORION: No. Oh, I mean in real life. Yeah.\nMARISHA: No.\nORION: I was like, don't touch it.","response":"DM: So. Eventually you all manage to make your way towards the outer wall of Emon to the southern portion of the city. The guards let you through. Two of them recognize you from the Winter's Crest celebration that occurred about seven months beforehand. Don't do that, that's going to end poorly. You make your way around the bend to the large grass hill that is surrounded by the river that skirts the outer southern portion of Greyskull Keep. Looking up, you can see against the moonlight the very welcome sight of your home there, beckoning to you to rest. You make your way to the front gates that surround the outskirts of it, and an iron bell kind of goes off for a second, and as you look up, you hear a voice go, “Who goes there? Speak your mind, or a bolt to the throat you'll find.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Shayne, is that Shayne?\nORION: Is it dark right now?","response":"DM: It's dark, yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I cast Light. “It's us!”","response":"DM: Okay, a light pierces off, and you guys look up and you can see, sitting on kind of the watchtower perch–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Or wait, is that Jarett?","response":"DM: No, you see up there, short, rough red hair, Shayne Tranter, one of the mercenaries you hired–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, it is Shayne, I was right the first time!","response":"DM: She's got her crossbow ready to go, and she's just kind of sitting back and pointing it at the group, and she goes,"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hello! Hi!\nLAURA: Hope you remember us!\nMARISHA: Shayne!\nTALIESIN: We're drunk!\nSAM: We pay you!\nASHLEY: We forgot our key!","response":"DM: “Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? It's been nearly a week since you left.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's it?\nSAM: Feels like a month.\nASHLEY: Feels like three months.\nTALIESIN: Feels like eleven weeks. It feels like a very long time.","response":"DM: “Well, it's probably closer to two weeks. Fair enough. Either way. Open the gates! Cordell, open the gates!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Cordell? I don't remember the names of any of our guards.","response":"DM: Cordell, he's one of the other half-orc guards that you hired when you left."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We have Shayne, Cordell, Jarett, Kendrick, and Nitebe.\nLAURA: Jarett was the one we appointed as the head guard, right? Captain?\nMARISHA: Jarett? I think so. I didn't write that part down.\nLAURA: I don't remember about the little fellow.\nSAM: Our staff is so unappreciated, guys.","response":"DM: So as the gate slowly opens, Cordell walking out, this is the hearty half-orc merc dressed in scale armor, and he has a large sword slung on his back, just shoves it open to about a two-foot distance. “Come on. Welcome home.” As each of you guys walk through, he kinda claps you on the back as you walk in. You make your way into the small courtyard leading to– making your way into Greyskull Keep. Towards the front door, as you get there, the front door opens on its own as you're about ten feet away and peering from the inside of the low-lit interior you see a woman's face, a plump blond woman's face, peek through. This is Laina. Laina goes, “Oh, you're back, fantastic! It's \"early.” And she rubs her face and you see as she pushes the door open a little more, she's wearing her nightgown, and she's excited but still very tired. “Come in, come in, come in, please, please! Who's that?” And points to the large stone statue you're dragging behind you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, we decided to get a statue for the garden.\nTALIESIN: Garden gnome.","response":"DM: “Very well, very well, come in.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Hey!\nTRAVIS: He's drunk.\nTALIESIN: I'm drunk!","response":"DM: So the human woman leads you all back in."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Put the gun down, Percy.\nASHLEY: Bad News.\nLIAM: It's not Cinco de Mayo.","response":"DM: She steps back with her knitted boots; she's definitely in comfortable mode. She eagerly hugs each of you as you enter, happy that you've all arrived, she's like, “I swear it's– I've not had an employer leave so quickly after my hiring. But glad to see you're all safe. Shall I make everyone a meal, are you hungry?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Starving.\nTRAVIS: Yes.","response":"DM: “I'll get right to it.” And she turns around, and you see further down the hallway Erwen Dastell, your older halfling servant who shuffles up with his nightcap on, it's long and dangling off his shoulders, he's got this long night robe on, he's kinda carrying a small candle. “My goodness. The hour is late of  your arrival, but I can't say I am not excited to see you. Come in, your beds are ready, everything's been cleaned and made to your specifications. Laina! To food!” “I'm already on it, Erwen.” She kinda smacks him on the back. He says, “Very well, then.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I love their banter.\nLAURA: Yeah, they're so cute.","response":"DM: “I will go back to bed, if that's fine with you.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is there any urgent, oppressing news, any visitors that we should know about who came while we were gone, anything before you retire for the evening?","response":"DM: “No, I believe your friend, the mage woman with the blue robes came by once.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Allara?","response":"DM: “Allura. She came by a couple days ago, just to see if you had returned. But I didn't know where you were, and she said she'd try again later.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Any packages, mail, post?","response":"DM: “None that I know of, no. In fact it's been very quiet.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Quiet is good.","response":"DM: “Back to my quarters.” And he shuffles off, goes towards his bed. You guys make your way into the main dining chamber of your Keep, four large round tables set out with the chairs around it. You can see, for the most part, it's been untouched other than a couple of chairs that are set ajar, probably by your mercenary soldiers who've been eating and/or have been keeping up. There's a couple of empty tables set on the side that immediately Laina goes, “I'm so sorry, I guess I should've taken care of this.” And she stumbles off towards the kitchen and you guys all eventually find yourselves sitting, sore, exhausted, mildly intoxicated, around these chairs and take a very deep-breathing sigh of relief at being back home here in Emon in Greyskull Keep."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Should we un-stone Kima, or should we sleep on it?\nORION: I stand up and I head towards the sleeping quarters and I just say, “Leave her to stone tonight, we'll deal with it tomorrow.” And I go to bed.\nSAM: I turn him into a rat.\nLIAM: Dispel Magic.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw, Tiberius."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hold on a sec. I can still cast as an animal, right?\nSAM: Nope.","response":"DM: Nope, you cannot talk."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh. I still go to bed.\nORION: So yeah.\nTRAVIS: Hoo baby.\nLAURA: That's adorable.","response":"DM: You go under your covers, go to sleep, nuzzle in."}
{"prompt":"ORION: In between my pillow.\nMARISHA: It's quite comfy sleeping like an animal.\nASHLEY: He's a little rat and he still went in his big bed.\nLIAM: I pick up the sleeping rat and just kinda scritch him.\nLAURA: He's in bed.\nTRAVIS: We ate already, right?","response":"DM: You snacked a bit as you made it through the town, but for the most part like, a meal's being prepared. You begin to smell now the cooking of meat, Laina's setting it up for you guys."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're dreaming of magical artifacts, aren't you?\nLAURA: Quick question, friends: So we kind of started a war, am I right?\nLIAM: Yeah. Pretty sure we did.\nLAURA: Kraghammer is potentially in grave danger, am I right?\nMARISHA: We might want to let them know.\nLAURA: We should probably let them know as soon as possible.\nLIAM: First of all, Clarota was lying through his noodles, and second, even if he wasn't, which he was, he's now fucking pissed off–\nLAURA: He's dead.\nLIAM: Well, they're all one hive-mind, right? Listen. This is number five tonight.\nTALIESIN: They weren't particularly connected until the very end, he was dead before they were actually connected.\nLIAM: They're angry. They were following us.\nTALIESIN: They may not know who we are.\nMARISHA: That's interesting.\nLIAM: You don't think they're going to scurry up the bottom of Kraghammer and tear that place apart?\nTALIESIN: We'll let them know, but we may have time, we hurt them very badly.\nLIAM: It took us about a week to get from Kraghammer in, so we've got about a week.\nMARISHA: Well, why don't we do some research, I mean, this was the first time.\nSAM: Yeah, we'd have to stop them on the way out the hole, right? There's only one way in and out.\nASHLEY: Don't the dwarves already know that they were there, and they were already prepping for battle?\nSAM: They don't really know what's coming for them.\nLIAM: They don't know anything about mind flayers, they know about weird things coming out, but not the mind flayers.\nTRAVIS: So let's send a pigeon or something.\nTALIESIN: The mind flayers have been down there for ages. There's nothing new.\nLAURA: You don't think they'll come up and attack?\nMARISHA: To be fair, we also did sort of release the mind flayers from their evil dictator.\nLIAM: Yeah, they seemed very grateful.\nSAM: We could stop them on their way out.\nTALIESIN: I think this will also be a conversation that Lady Kima will have some–\nMARISHA: Okay, well, the thing we then need to immediately decide, before we un-stone Lady Kima, is what're we going to do with the Horn?\nTALIESIN: I think if we have Allura here, and begin that conversation, then we can have Allura's insight.\nMARISHA: Before we un-stone Lady Kima?\nTALIESIN: Yes. I think we tell Allura before we un-stone Lady Kima. Everything that's happened–\nLIAM: The only person, the only person that would remotely know is you, Tiberius, and I don't think–\nSAM: He's a rat.\nLIAM: Oh, that's a good boy.\nTRAVIS: And he's asleep.\nLIAM: He didn't seem to know anything, I think Allura is the person to go to right now.\nLAURA: Well, you need to share it with us.\nASHLEY: Wake up from bed!\nTRAVIS: He's sleeping.\nTALIESIN: No, let's wait until Allura's here, I think, and we can–\nTRAVIS: Do we tell her, do we tell her we have the Horn? Or do we not?\nLIAM: Yes, yes, we do.\nMARISHA: Why don't we just wake up Tiberius?\nLAURA: Tiberius. Little darling!\nSAM: I'm still punishing him.\nLIAM: I'm still cuddling him.\nORION: Did they wake me up?\nLIAM: No! I'm holding you.\nORION: Okay.\nLIAM: I don't want to wake you up.","response":"DM: You start to wake up, and then he scritches the side of your cheek and you go right back to sleep."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Damn it, he's so cute. I don't know what to do.","response":"DM: Laina comes out with plates for you guys and sets up these–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Thank. God.","response":"DM: They're not pretty, but functional meals of cooked pork, some fine mashed potatoes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would like to eat.","response":"DM: And you do ravenously, and this is the first warm meal you've really truly had in five, six days."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I take Lady Kima's portions and I–","response":"DM: There were no portions made for your garden structure."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Never know.","response":"DM: That's okay, there's plenty more."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So talk to Allura first, then unfreeze Lady Kima?\nLIAM: She sent us after Kima. Kima thinks that she's in the middle of a fight, the moment she comes out she'll be all hot and bothered–\nMARISHA: Okay, hang on, hang on. That's true, she did send us after Kima, so what if they're both on the side that we don't–\nTRAVIS: Yeah, Allura's going to unfreeze Kima.\nTALIESIN: We're going to have to trust somebody.\nTRAVIS: Why don't we just hold onto the Horn for a second and see what they do without it.\nLAURA: Why don't we tell them we didn't find it? Why don't we just hide the Horn?\nTRAVIS: We just hold onto it in the bag.\nMARISHA: Don't we have a safe? Didn't we build a safe in our Keep?","response":"DM: You did not have a safe built, but you could possibly have that done."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wait, so why are you guys so against giving the Horn to Kima?\nMARISHA: I just feel like if it's so terrible, why does she want it for herself?\nLAURA: She doesn't, she wants to hide it.\nASHLEY: Does she want to destroy it?\nLAURA: Maybe she wants to destroy it, maybe she wanted to get it up above ground so she could destroy it.\nSAM: There's a second Horn, maybe she has the other one and wants the matching set.\nTALIESIN: Do we know that there's a second horn?\nLAURA: She's a paladin, she's good, paladins are good by–\nSAM: I'm fine trusting her. I was fine trusting Clarota.\nTRAVIS: Do you want to wake up, do you have something important to say?\nMARISHA: Right, because no one of the church has ever been bad before.\nLIAM: We didn't trust Clarota. We were using him as much as he was using us.\nLAURA: Some of us truly trusted Clarota.\nLIAM: It went south. Well, most of us.\nSAM: He's still a rat!\nTRAVIS: I shake it a lot.\nMARISHA: I undo his Polymorph, I undo his Polymorph.\nSAM and MATT: With what?\nMARISHA: By Polymorph.","response":"DM: You re-Polymorph him?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I release Polymorph by using Polymorph?","response":"DM: No. It's his incantation."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I spit on Tiberius's head and rub it in vigorously.\nMARISHA: Scanlan, come on. We need to talk to him.\nORION: I'm trying to bite Grog. I am not happy.","response":"DM: It's like this viscous Grog spit mixed with chunks of pork and mashed potato rubbed in your fur."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Scanlan, he's nipping! Scanlan. Tiberius is nipping. Please.\nLIAM: He's not human at all.\nSAM: A dragonborn.\nORION: Why did you wake me up?

It's nice being cuddly.\nORION: I was so soft.\nLAURA: Tiberius, we're sorry to wake you.\nTALIESIN: Tiberius, we're having a lovely breakfast. Tell us a story.\nORION: Have I rested? What's going on?","response":"DM: No, it's been ten minutes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What the fuck?\nTRAVIS: Vex has a question for you.\nMARISHA: We're all still drunk and awake. We don't want to go to bed yet! Just, just talk with us.\nLAURA: I just want to hear your lovely little explanation, darling, about what the Horn is and why you don't trust Kima.\nORION: Oh!\nTALIESIN: Tell us a story.\nMARISHA: Tell us a story!\nLAURA: Please. You haven't told any of us anything.\nMARISHA: We haven't talked to you in a week.\nORION: The Horn of Orcus.","response":"DM: Horn of Orcus."}
{"prompt":"ORION: This thing comes from a devil, a demon. Nothing good could ever come from anything it made in existence. It needs to be destroyed. And I'm sorry. Let me articulate these words a little bit more. There is nothing that you can use this particular artifact for any reason of good. The fact that it is even here is a very bad sign because it was taken from one of these beasts.\nASHLEY: So why don't we destroy it?\nORION: That's exactly what we need to do.\nTRAVIS: Isn't that what Kima wanted?\nLAURA: What if they want to destroy it?\nORION: I don't think they wanted to bring it back.\nLAURA: Question. Why?\nORION: Because there is– the liquid hot magma that was below where it was being held was very sufficient for it to be thrown in.\nMARISHA: That's true. See, I'm with him.\nLAURA: Wait, but your crushing fist couldn't destroy it, so maybe lava can't destroy it, so maybe it needs something extra special that only they know about.\nTRAVIS: It needs the Sword of Gryffindor.\nORION: No. Pike could destroy it.\nASHLEY: Ex-squeeze me? I don't think that's true.\nORION: Give yourself a little bit more credit. You killed a dragon.\nLAURA and TRAVIS: You did kill a dragon.\nASHLEY: I did kill a dragon. Huzzah.\nMARISHA: And you died. And come back to life. By the way, we haven't talked about that. What was it like on the other side?\nTRAVIS: Let's stay on topic here.\nMARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a little tipsy.\nLIAM: Vax shoves another flagon in front of Keyleth.\nASHLEY: I don't think I can destroy it.\nTALIESIN: From what I understand– is it possible that it's not possible to destroy this and instead it has to be banished somewhere, perhaps?\nORION: No. If it could be a permanent banishment, yes. But we don't know what kind of plane and what creatures lie there that would, perhaps, come upon that artifact. What are the elements? Fire burns earth.\nLAURA: Wind blows.\nORION: Light destroys darkness. Pike, you're the only one who–\nSAM: Rock beats scissors.\nORION: Exactly, Scanlan. You're the only one who could– if your weapon had any kind of light enchantment on them, could probably smash this thing to bits. Then we would have to scatter the remnants, the pieces, far from each other, if not find different ways to destroy those pieces.\nLAURA: Why don't you trust them?\nORION: Because it comes from something that would–\nLAURA: Not the Horn. Why don't you trust Kima?\nORION: Because they wanted to bring it somewhere where they– I don't know. Which is why I wanted you to do the half thing, where we could question Kima without her attacking us or trying to attempt to take the Horn from us.\nMARISHA: Well, here's my thing. Even if she has good intentions. Say she has good intentions and maybe they just wanted to bring the horn back to study it. And no one should be messing with this whatsoever.\nLAURA: I think they want to destroy it.\nTALIESIN: I'm of the opinion they probably want to banish it somewhere.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I think they do.\nMARISHA: Then why don't we just agree to not hand it over.\nTALIESIN: No, this is good. This means that there's no reason, necessarily, not to trust them. We just know that we don't trust the Horn, and that's a perfectly reasonable way to come at it.\nLIAM: In the short term, Scanlan, are you able to send it to another dimension for a while?\nLAURA: No, I don't trust it anywhere out of our sight.\nSAM: I cannot. It is not alive. I cannot.\nTRAVIS: Put it in the bag.\nLAURA: It's in the bag.\nTALIESIN: It's perfectly safe in the bag.\nTRAVIS: How about we rest, we put the Horn in the bag, we wake up Kima, we go, “Oh, we brought you back, sorry we don't have the Horn. If we did, what would you do with it?” And then we decide what we do.\nTALIESIN: I like half that plan.\nMARISHA: I kind of like that plan.\nORION: I like that plan, too.\nLAURA: I think we should tell her we didn't get it and see what she does.\nORION: Allura is somebody who should not be here when this conversation happens, because if they turn south, she's a more powerful sorcerer than I.\nMARISHA: We need to decide, do we tell her that we destroyed it, or do we tell her that we just didn't get it and that it's still down there.\nTRAVIS: We can't say destroyed because we don't know how we did that, right?\nLAURA: No, we didn't destroy it. We say, “Oh no, they, we got overrun and we had to leave.”\nTALIESIN: But then they're going to tell us to go back for it.\nTRAVIS: That's fine, but if we ask like what she would've done if we had it, and when she leaves we go, “Hah, we have it.”\nLAURA: Or we go, “Oh, well good, then actually we do have it, you can do that.”\nTRAVIS: Yeah, if she wants to study it or use it or transform it into something, we don't give it to her, we try to destroy it ourselves. If she wants to banish it and do something that Tiberius is happy with, then we go like, “Hey, we have it.”\nLIAM: When we meet her I don't think we should have it, I think one or two of us should take it away. We don't all have to be at that meeting.\nTALIESIN: I think we just keep it in the Bag of Holding, she'll never suspect.\nMARISHA: Well, hang on, it's in the Bag of Holding right now?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nORION: Grog, is there nothing else in that bag of holding?\nTRAVIS: Nothing it can, we took out all the stuff it can turn into some like evil transformer or something.\nLIAM: You know, the other characters can make insight checks too, you know that, right?","response":"DM: There's a pile somewhere with armor."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Everything has out with parentheses next to it.\nLIAM: If we have it, then she's, she could say you're lying–\nLAURA: Or she might not be able to tell because we're so good at lying.\nLIAM: I don't think your winks will work on her.\nSAM: Legitimately, no one can tell when I'm lying.\nMARISHA: I mean, we could Stone Shape it and I could like Stone Shape it and bury it somewhere in our Keep.\nTRAVIS: One person should leave with it. I'll leave with it.\nLIAM: Yes, it's fucking simple.\nTALIESIN: That's genius.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I'll leave. It's not like I'm going to talk to the sorcerers.\nLIAM: You and I could take a walk with it and play tiddlywinks or something in the woods. That's fine, what's wrong with that, it's easy.\nTALIESIN: That's a very good plan.\nORION: Do you want it very far away?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, you're a talker, I'm not.\nTALIESIN: No, we don't.\nMARISHA: Wait. You're talking about just taking a stroll through the forest with the Horn of Orcus?\nTRAVIS: No, I'll just hang out outside.\nORION: In the Keep, how about just stay in the Keep?\nLIAM: Just be somewhere else. Anywhere else.\nASHLEY: You could hang out in the temple downstairs.\nLAURA: I fall asleep on the table.\nTRAVIS: Shall we sleep?\nSAM: Let's sleep and meet with Kima in the morning.\nTALIESIN: This was a fabulous breakfast, good night.\nLIAM: Vax gives his sleeping sister a wet willie.\nLAURA: Ugh!\nTRAVIS: I put my head right in my food and fall asleep.","response":"DM: Okay."}

Get up and stand up. “Enjoy your breakfast. You've earned it.” “I think our shift is done.” She pats Cordell and they both get up and they exit out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Have a good night! I know, I know, but they're sleeping.\nTRAVIS: I start awake with food on my face and I wipe it off and eat it. “I had a horrible dream about two walking testicles that were hurting my mind.”\nSAM: That was no dream!\nLIAM: I am so sad that you woke up. I was just about to go to the hearth and get some ash and draw a penis on your head.\nTRAVIS: I had a feeling something was coming.\nLIAM: Next thing out of my mouth, that's a promise.\nASHLEY: Where's the Bag of Holding?\nTRAVIS: I've got it.\nASHLEY: Can you check in your bag to see if the Horn is still there?\nLAURA: And it's okay?\nTRAVIS: I look in the bag of holding and I see a Horn?","response":"DM: You look in the bag and you see nothing. You imagine something, you reach in, you pull it out."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Don't do that.\nLAURA: How are we going to get it out of there?\nORION: I can.\nASHLEY: Can you tell if it's in there?\nSAM: Can you teleport something out of a bag?\nORION: It's Telekinesis, I can picture it and–\nLAURA: Teleport it, can you pull it out and make sure it's still there and okay?","response":"DM: Okay. So you use Telekinesis, you lift the Horn out–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, I don't do it. I'm assuming it's there. I'm not doing that right now.\nLAURA: Wait, no, check though, I want to make sure it's okay.\nORION: I'm pretty sure it's there.\nLAURA: But I want to make sure.","response":"DM: Mage Hand gently and slowly lifts it out, you can see the Horn kinda holds there for a second, it moves very slowly."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, put it back in.","response":"DM: Put it back in the bag."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Thank you, tie it up tight. I'm going to go down to the, what is it, the temple below the thingie?\nASHLEY: Okay, yeah, go down to the temple.","response":"DM: Okay, so you head down into the temple to Sarenrae, which is beautiful, it's all like a giant two-story stained glass three-set walls with trees and hedges set up and flowers, bunch of wooden kind of long benches set up towards this, the altar in the center, it's beautiful, especially this time of day, it's close to noon right now so the sun's streaking through the top of it, and it's cascading through the tree boughs of the two trees that are closest to the entrance. It's a beautiful sight. Even you, Grog, are moved."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Just because I'm nervous, I reach into the Bag of Holding and pull out a vial of holy oil that I have. I have three vials of holy oil and I just hold it in one hand while I'm down there.\nORION: I'm going to cast Circle of Teleportation in my room.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, I'm going to go to the treasury first, I'm going to take out 500 gold pieces, and then I'm going to go to my room and cast Circle of Teleportation.","response":"DM: Okay. Tiberius is gone."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's heal Kima.\nLAURA: You just left us?\nORION: By the blessing of Bahamut, I choose Draconia.","response":"DM: Tiberius is gone."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so, I'm going to stand behind Kima and–\nTALIESIN: We're going to face her towards the wall.\nASHLEY: Face her towards the wall.\nLIAM: Good idea.\nASHLEY: Or towards something happy.\nTALIESIN: We're ready to pull you away when she starts to move.\nASHLEY: Yeah, okay. So.\nMARISHA: Wait! Are we unfreezing her?\nTALIESIN and TRAVIS: Yeah.\nMARISHA: No, I thought we were going to talk to Allura first.\nLAURA: No, we're going to talk to her first.\nMARISHA: Oh wait, that's right. And we were going to do that thing.\nLAURA: You were drunk, it's okay.\nMARISHA: That's right, I was probably tipsy, sorry. We came up with like eight plans last night.\nLAURA: You were so drunk.\nSAM: Wait, shouldn't Grog be here, he's the one who likes her.\nTRAVIS: Oh, the things I sacrifice for the group.\nASHLEY: So I cast Greater Restoration on Kima.\nLAURA: And then run away!","response":"DM: Okay, you reach out and touch the back of Kima. Her stone armor turns to gold and rapidly her entire form goes back to flesh. As she finishes her swing with the maul (impact sound) against the stone wall. And she kinda steps back for a second, confused, and looks over her shoulder at the rest of you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Everything's okay, everything's okay, we're out of danger, we're at home, it's okay.\nLAURA: It's fine, it's fine, guess what, we are alive.\nSAM: We lived.","response":"DM: Just drops the maul for a second and kinda leans back against the wall."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I just get the leftover mashed potatoes from breakfast.","response":"DM: “Thank you, thank you, oh thank you. What happened?” She's not even using utensils, she's just like scooping it with her hand at this point."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So we killed K'Varn, right?","response":"DM: “Obviously.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Funny story, you were right about Clarota. He was horrible, we killed him. We killed him! Hey, you were right.\nLAURA: But not before we were overrun with a bunch of evil brothers of his.\nTALIESIN: And we got a very fancy hat out of it.\nLAURA: Hey, right, look at his hat.\nSAM: We should've known all along, you were right, we should've trusted you, sorry.\nLIAM: You were right, we were wrong, you're very attractive, we're all quite ugly.","response":"DM: “That isn't necessary, but the compliment is appreciated, regardless. Thank you for bringing me back with you. You could have easily left me back and I appreciate that you took the time.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: So, you're alive, that's good because you were sorta on a suicide mission.","response":"DM: “Not a suicide mission.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What exactly was your mission, Kima?","response":"DM: “Where's the Horn?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, thing is, it's not here.\nSAM: It's in a safe place.","response":"DM: “How safe?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Pretty safe.\nTALIESIN: Why, what can it do?","response":"DM: She looks visually nervous and she goes–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nothing can touch it.","response":"DM: “Well, that's what the Order that originally sealed it believes. Even if it's somewhere safe temporarily, we can possibly relocate it. But we have to– (sighs)”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You saw your mission as a suicide mission, but if you had secured it, what were your plans? What was plan B? What were you going to do?","response":"DM: “Well, if I were to fall in the process of trying to get the Horn, others would come after me. I sent word to my Order that if I did not return they would send more.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I insight?","response":"DM: Go for it, yeah, go ahead and roll insight."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 19.\nSAM: Ooh!\nMARISHA: Whisper time! Sweet, sweet whispers.\nSAM: Keep subscribing, guys, because whispering action doesn't come free.\nMARISHA: How many subscribers away are we?\nLUCAS: 38.\nMARISHA: 38 subscribers.\nTRAVIS, MARISHA, and SAM: That's a lot.\nMARISHA: That is still a lot.\nSAM: Keep subscribing to Geek and Sundry, where you can watch Matt Mercer whisper at people.","response":"DM: And she goes, “So this Horn, which is one of two, if Allura is correct, was sealed a thousand or so years ago by those who originally cut it from the head of the avatar of Orcus of which it was bestowed. They, once he was slain, did everything they could within their power to destroy it, yet this artifact, instilled with the purity of Orcus, was indestructible to their knowledge. So the least they could do was to seal both horns across the world from each other and forget that it even existed. Which worked well ntil recently. It wasn't until these visions came to me and other members of my Order that we knew that this, this was a thing, and me being the closest in my pilgrimage, we took that as time of the essence I was to go in there with a team and retrieve it. If it couldn't be destroyed, at the very least we could convene and decide a safer place to possibly reseal it and forget. There are magical ways of forcing those of us who know how to forget. That would be the safest thing for it. If there is a way to destroy it, we don't know, but that could also be sought after. We have arcane and divine knowledge we didn't have back then, so, in the long run it needs to be retrieved, the longer it stays down there in the Underdark, no matter where you placed it, it draws like a beacon all darkness to it until something else like this beholder K'Varn will take up the mantle and themselves be as dangerous or more so than he ever was.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So the other Horn is still safe?","response":"DM: “As far as I know. The visions only gave me access to where this one was. I can only assume that it's out there, but if someone else were to find it, I would know that they probably have knowledge of the second one existing, as well. I don't know if K'Varn shared this information, but if someone else takes the mantle of this Horn, what's to stop them from seeking the other?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Bummer.\nMARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: “Regardless, I appreciate that we're all alive and we're together, and where are we?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, you're in our home.\nSAM: Greyskull Keep. It's in Emon.","response":"DM: “We're in Emon?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes.","response":"DM: “Well, that's wondrous, we can speak with Allura. She would have the wisdom to know what to do with this next.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hypothetical. What if an army of darkness was slowly approaching Emon to kill all of us?","response":"DM: “What are you saying?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, we killed Clarota and K'Varn, but we, there was a lot of bad guys down there that we could not kill–\nLAURA: We hurt that Elder Brain real bad, but not bad enough.","response":"DM: “I don't know much about the illithid themselves, but they reside deep and they are not fans of the surface. I believe that it was K'Varn's initial onset that was pushing them, both in union with the duergar and pushing them towards the siege. They spoke of something about bringing twilight to the surface world. I don't know what that was about, but I fear what knowledge they have if left alone. At the very least, I know that they're probably having to return and lick their wounds where we left behind. It would be folly for them, especially knowing that we're aware, to attack now.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, that's good.","response":"DM: “But we can notify those in Kraghammer to buffer their defenses, close the tunnels that you took down there and my army as well, and that should give us time to prepare if we choose to seize or at least seal them off.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And your Order is what?","response":"DM: “The Order of the Platinum Dragon.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right. That's a really good Order, right?\nTALIESIN: History check, can I do a history check?","response":"DM: It's a religion check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's a religion check, not history check?\nMARISHA: Pike.","response":"DM: You could roll a history check and probably gain some knowledge based on that, but the–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Could I do it?","response":"DM: If you'd like to."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Are you doing a religion check, Percy?\nTALIESIN: I'm doing a history check, if you want to do a religion check.\nASHLEY: I'll do a religion check.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 22.\nASHLEY: So fucking close.","response":"DM: I mean, you guys are familiar loosely with the name Bahamut, you've heard Tiberius bring it up before, you've seen temples to it, but your knowledge knows that Bahamut is very well regarded as the lawful good deity of justice and honor and is primarily one of the great good gods of this pantheon."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: If we're going to trust anyone, I think this is a good–\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I feel pretty good about this.\nTALIESIN: I trust the organization, they have a sterling reputation.\nMARISHA: So, Kima. Pie-in-the-sky goal? You would destroy the Horn?","response":"DM: “If we had the means of doing so, yes. We'd have to talk to the Order, we'd have to talk to the Council, we'd have to bring people that we could trust and that had the capabilities of knowing if this were possible how we would go about it. It's beyond my knowledge.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I think what worries us is anyone coming in contact with it would be corrupted.","response":"DM: “Don't go into contact with it.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No.\nLIAM: No, of course.\nMARISHA: Just within range.\nSAM: Yes, is proximity okay?","response":"DM: “I don't know, I saw it for as long as you did.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This could be bad.\nSAM: Evil Grog?\nLAURA: Kind of uncomfortable.","response":"DM: “The essence of most artifacts like this, it goes more than just touch, one has to be imbued, bond with these artifacts, to attune with them like any powerful magical item to truly gain its power, but that's not to say that itself does not contain some sort of foul intelligence.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I go downstairs and go get Grog?","response":"DM: Okay. So you walk your way down."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (sings) I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.","response":"DM: As you're walking past, as you walk past you are immediately met in the hallway by Erwen, your servant, your halfling elder servant who walks up and says, “Dear, I wanted to let you know that a scroll came for you, some sort of a summons.” And he hands it to you."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Me?\nSAM: Probably jury duty.","response":"DM: And he kinda walks past you in the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Always the worst time.","response":"DM: You open it up a little bit, it's not, hasn't been opened, you kinda pull the paper and open it up. It's a summon to the Council of Tal'Dorei, it's written by the hand of the clerk, and it says, essentially, the sovereign Uriel has been notified of your arrival and would like to see you at the council chambers posthaste."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. I'm still going to go get Grog, but I'll pass the scroll around. Hey Grog, come upstairs.\nTRAVIS: Oh yeah?\nMARISHA: That was for all of us?\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: It was addressed to Vox Machina."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is it clear?\nASHLEY: Just don't say anything yet, but just come upstairs.\nTRAVIS: Did she ask about me?\nLAURA: She definitely did.\nASHLEY: She did, yeah.\nTRAVIS: With my bald head.\nMARISHA: Oh, we have one of the best defense mechanisms. Grog!\nTRAVIS: Hello, Lady Kima.\nLAURA: It's in a very secure magical item.\nMARISHA: I use my Druidcraft as he enters to make little sparkles and lightning bugs appear around him. “Grog!”","response":"DM: Lady Kima, who is currently covered in dirt and sweat, still in the golden armor that she wrestled from the long-dead corpse of a dwarf in the Underdark, her chin is smattered with dried mashed potatoes and a bit of her breakfast, kinda gives–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So she's covered in food as well.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, more than alive, I think.\nASHLEY: And also, he actually pulled you out of the cavern with one arm while you were stone. Out of the whole place.\nTRAVIS: Oh, stop, I don't like to brag.","response":"DM: She stands up and kinda wipes the food off her chin, clutches her symbol, and then steps right before you, looking up towards your face and says, “I thank you, friend Grog.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Friendzoned!","response":"DM: And then reaches out and gives you a big hug."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Plus he decided not to put you in the magical bag when you were a statue.","response":"DM: She releases Grog slightly, and kinda gives you a keen look and goes, “Also appreciated.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, well, you know.\nLAURA: Oh my god, thank god.\nSAM: Why don't you go rest? We'll summon Allura and we'll continue the conversation from there, I guess.\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nTRAVIS: You could use my room.\nTALIESIN: There's a guest room.\nLAURA: Yes, we have a guest room.\nSAM: We should use it.\nORION: I would've had your back, by the way, there.\nTRAVIS: Thank you.","response":"DM: Erwen, who's by the door, leads her to the guest room and you guys take a moment to rest. We'll go ahead and pick up next session at that point, where Allura's being brought in, so we'll stop the game there as I have to rush to the airport, but before that we have some gifts to open from you guys."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You're rushing to the airport tonight?","response":"DM: Huh?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You're rushing to the airport tonight?","response":"DM: Yeah, I got a redeye, 1AM. To be in Sandusky, Ohio. At Collisi–er no, Collosalcon. Please come."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You're going to do the waterslides, right? You won't ride waterslides?","response":"DM: It'll be fun. Guys, thank you so much for watching, that was a lot of fun."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: We lived!","response":"DM: Barely, oh my god."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: One point, twice.","response":"DM: Twice for you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Twice.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to go get our d20s back.\nMARISHA: Crazyballs. Oh yeah. We had two sparkles and a green one.\nASHLEY: I was just rolling bad.\nZAC: Hey, guys. We got some gifts for you from the chatroom. Some letters.\nLIAM: I got an Asus computer with an “aren't we clever” sticker on it?\nMARISHA: Sweet.\nZAC: Man, I'll give you an “aren't we clever” sticker if you want, it's worth about the same. We also have some donations to read off.\nZAC: So guys, as long as we're live, that subscriber giveaway still stands.\nLAURA: How far away are we from it?\nMARISHA: Aw, that's a good idea!","response":"DM: “I thought it'd be something different for you guys to do, hopefully you enjoy it and I can't wait to hear back from you.

And we had a couple more donations really quickly come in. Just wanted to say thank you to–","response":"DM: What's that?"}
{"prompt":"LUCAS: Did you read the dice on the shirt?\nLAURA: Awesome!\nTALIESIN: That's so cool.\nLAURA: Oh, that's really cool.\nZAC: For the people that donated after we started reading the donations, I know Matt's trying to get outta here pretty quick, so thank you, FoxyForsythe, Zopher, Metheram and Hunter, I'll make sure these guys get the messages that you guys sent, but we're going to go ahead and let these guys start packing up. I know that they have lives!\nMARISHA: We're tweeting pictures of our dice and our things so everyone can see now.\nLAURA: I'm hashtagging Critmas.\nZAC: Did we make that sub goal?\nORION: Oh my god, is that your die that you got?\nZAC: We did not make the sub goal, so we'll get you guys– no, we're not going to get it, so we'll get you guys with a giveaway tomorrow.","response":"DM: Next time, you can do it then. You guys are ridiculous, thank you so much. Have a wonderful night."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Thank you guys so, so much.","response":"DM: See you next week on Thursday."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We love you guys, you're amazing!","response":"DM: So, for those of us who – Just a little heads up here, the party has just returned after a long arduous trek through The Underdark, beneath the Dwarven city of Kraghammer. They were sent to retrieve a paladin named Lady Kima of Vord, who was on a vision quest to stop some dark evil that her deity Bahamut told her was existing beneath this mountain range, and needed to be squelched. The party managed to salvage her from insidious torture, and through her aid as well as a Mind Flayer who had been outcast from the society and the colony nearby. They managed to convince to help them as well, fought their way through the tunnels, past the Duergar army, eventually to the underground Mindflayer colony of Yogg Voril where they found that this entity called K'varn. This was then eventually revealed to be a mad beholder, K'varn, who had been pseudo possessed and given additional power by the Horn of Orcus, a great and evil artifact long forgotten, which had been found by this entity. So they managed to make their way into the temple, kill K'varn, tear the horn from it's forehead, however found themselves swarmed  immediately by an entire colony of mind flayers heading toward the top of this temple. They managed to battle and battle, nearly losing a few party members, and through some ingenuity, escape through the top, glide over the city of Yogg Voril through this underground chasm to a distant embankment along the beachside of this underground lake. And teleport their way back to their base city of Emon. So they've come back to Emon, they've come to their keep, Greyskull Keep, and they've had an evening of rest. Upon waking the next morning, they've managed to get some breakfast, they've freed Lady Kima from her stone entrapment as she was turned to stone during the battle with the beholder, and had a conversation based around what should or could be done about this Horn of Orcus evil artifact. So here we will pick up again from that point. So the rest of you guys have eaten your meal, Kima hungrily doing so. All of you guys both sore and exhausted having barely seen sunlight for a little over a week and being probably the first or second good meal you've had since leaving Kraghammer proper. You all finish your food, Grog hungrily so, double the size of his normal intake of delicious meats and starches. Tiberius has not seemed to have woken up or found his way down from his room as of yet. However, you guys did recently receive a rolled up piece of parchment. A notification from the council of Tal'Dorei, saying that you have been requested to the council chambers at some point this afternoon, around the mid-day sun, to discuss your return and the situation and conditions about it. And that was all it said."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I can't remember is Lady Kima with us at this point? Is she unstoned?","response":"DM: She's unstoned, you've already had the conversation with her last week talking about the horn, basically interrogating her."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And we said that we had it somewhere safe, but weren't we playing coy with that?","response":"DM: You were playing coy with it but you –"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I had gone downstairs to go get Grog.","response":"DM: Yes, Grog returned with it and you guys had the conversation basically saying 'Oh, it's safe, don't worry. It's fine'. Grog at which currently has it in the bag of holding."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But we haven't told her that it's in the bag of holding right?","response":"DM: No you just said you have it somewhere safe."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We just said we have it somewhere safe.","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: Turn them up a little bit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I am highly entertained.\nLIAM: I think we're getting feedback.","response":"DM: Oh, I see."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's us.\nLAURA: Right! That would be us.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sorry about that.\nASHLEY: We'll figure this out guys.\nMARISHA: That wasn't too bad.","response":"DM: This is the new attempt at technology with our out-of-towners."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's amazing.\nMARISHA: It's working pretty well.\nTALIESIN: It is working pretty well.\nMARISHA: I'm kind of impressed.\nTALIESIN: Have we actually opened up the parchment and read it yet?","response":"DM: Yes, you have received it and you've inspected it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: It's Tiberius.\nORION: Hey everybody.\nMARISHA: Yes.\nLAURA: Hey boo.\nTALIESIN: I don't know what's going to happen.","response":"DM: He's going to crawl under the table. There you have it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Good morning sleepyhead.\nORION: Hi guys.","response":"DM: As a couple hours have passed –"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Good morning Tiberius.\nORION: Hi. Right. Hello. Am I here?\nLIAM: Yes you've just come down the stairs.","response":"DM: You've just now come down after many hours of breakfast have passed. It's now pushing around 11:00 in the afternoon comparatively, and Tiberius comes storming into the main dining hall of your keep."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Morning everyone.\nMARISHA: What is that?\nORION: This is my own bag of holding. And I walk over to Grog and I open their bag of holding and take out my wheel of mending and I put it in here.\nLAURA: You got your own bag of holding?!\nORION: That's what I needed the extra gold for before I left.\nMARISHA: Where did you go to get that?\nORION: We're face-timing?\nMARISHA: Where did you go to get that?\nORION: Hey! Hi Guys!\nTALIESIN: Science.\nLIAM: We are the coolest.\nORION: I was like that's, “That's Laura's voice, where the hell is that coming from?”\nASHLEY: At least we think we're cool.\nMARISHA: At least we think we're cool.\nORION: Travis is there too! Sorry!\nORION: I mean.. Yes.\nLIAM: So Tiberius we're just waiting for you to awake. I think we should probably go and see the emperor, like you do. Talk about the little problem we have.\nMARISHA: Wait. Where did you go and get a bag of holding in the time of us sleeping and you waking up.\nORION: If you recall, I actually went to Draconia… when we all woke up to begin with.\nMARISHA: You didn't tell us that.\nORION: Why would I have to tell you?\nMARISHA: I didn't say you didn't have to, I'm just saying you acted like I should know and I'm saying I had no idea.\nORION: I could have sworn I cast that and said that last game.","response":"DM: No, you just stayed in your room and did it on your own."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh shit.\nMARISHA: Yeah. So right now you're crazy to me.\nORION: Right. Okay.\nTALIESIN: I'm also a little disturbed that it looks like that bag of holding is made of you.\nMARISHA: Yes it does look like it's made of drag – that seems cruel.\nORION: Actually this is wyvern skin. We use it in the air force of the Draconian army. And when the –\nASHLEY: Air force?\nORION: Yes. Draconia has an army, 500 standing, 200 are airborne.\nMARISHA: But they have an air force?\nORION: Yes. Keyleth: Do they fly– nevermind.\nTALIESIN: No, they just blow, they force air.\nORION: We have trained and tamed wyverns which we have utilized and they are part of our culture.\nTALIESIN: I've never seen a skinned one.\nORION: Yes. And so I went to the local “shoppe” and purchased a bag of holding because I realized that I did not hold my own wheel of mending for a long time.\nTALIESIN: That was frustrating you, wasn't it?\nORION: It was extremely frustrating. Especially because it's my artifact. Yes.\nMARISHA: Well that's good. It's probably good to have a second one of those. And it comes with water, how handy.\nORION: It holds a lot of things!\nMARISHA: How fantastic.\nTALIESIN: We should probably get off to see what the emperor wants.\nORION: Before we do that – Where's Scanlan now?\nMARISHA: Not here.","response":"DM: Scanlan is currently in the room eating breakfast"}
{"prompt":"ORION: We're all eating breakfast still right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hi everybody.\nLIAM: Not you, you've apparently been globe shopping.\nORION: Right. Scanlan? I was thinking about our last encounter. I'm going to take off my Iuon stone that's kinda chilling. This is a particular thing that you've seen me use several times. And I notice in the last couple of battles you've actually literally run out of spells to cast. I propose a friendly trade. The crown on your head allows you to do certain things which you have not utilized the last several rounds you've owned it. It seems you've actually complained about not having extra spells to cast.\nLIAM: Rounds of what?\nORION: –rounds of battle, Vax.\nLIAM: Oh.\nORION: I don't know.\nORION: So I assume that you could probably actually use this more. I have a tool that allows me to do it to begin with and it's come in rather handy as you've seen. What say you, Scanlan?","response":"DM: Scanlan looks to you and thinks for a second and goes \"You know what. I'm going to think on that.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's true Scanlan, you should probably wait until you're feeling a little more present.\nASHLEY: Wonderful plan Scanlan.","response":"DM: (as Scanlan) \"Agreed, agreed. A couple hours at the local brothel and all should be fine.\" He cracks his fingers, expectantly."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Welcome back, even though we didn't know you were gone. I've eaten. The rest of us have eaten –\nASHLEY: Were you gone all night?\nORION: No, just for about an hour.\nMARISHA: Oh.\nORION: It was a good trip. I needed it.\nASHLEY: Just saying hello to family and that?\nORION: No I just literally went to a shop I knew in Draconia and picked up the item. I wasn't sure if they had any in Emon and didn't really want to waste any time looking for one.\nASHLEY: Well…\nLIAM: Good on you, shall we go to meet the emperor?\nTALIESIN: I've eaten, let's politic.\nLIAM: I think so.\nTALIESIN: This is so –","response":"DM: Can you guys hear us fine?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Just making sure."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Too scared to talk is all.\nMARISHA: Scared to talk?\nLIAM: Chime in, please.","response":"DM: Feel free to chime in whenever."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: One of us, one of us.\nTRAVIS: Balls. Taint. Ale. Nipples.","response":"DM: That's our Grog."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Hey, there's Grog.\nMARISHA: Grog!","response":"DM: As our wonderful giant, now filled with various forms of delicious food matter warm in his belly, gives a string of various curse words in enjoyment, and sits up from the table with a loud fart and you guys make your way out of Greyskull Keep. Towards the outer wall of Emon, in towards the entrance to Abedar's Promenade, making your way towards the Cloudtop District where the palace itself resides. Is there any place –"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is Lady Kima with us?","response":"DM: Lady Kima is with you, yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Good.","response":"DM: Is there anything else you want to do or are you guys making a beeline for the palace?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I would like to take another 500 gold from the treasury before we do that. And I do.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait, what?\nLIAM: From the treasury? You have to ask the treasurer.\nLAURA: How much do you want?\nORION: Five hundred to replenish the 500 that I initially took. I don't know if I will have to spend it at all, and if I do, I will completely share my plan with all of you. But I would like to see how what we do plays out next.\nLAURA: Another 500?\nORION: Yes. That's all I do. That's all I want to do.","response":"DM: Anything else?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Have we had contact with Allura? Since returning?","response":"DM: Nuh uh."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Not yet? I feel good about her being at this meeting.\nASHLEY: Someone just got really excited when we mentioned the name Allura.\nORION: I cast prestidigitation on myself and make robes are all super clean and nice.","response":"DM: Got you. As you guys walk into the center of the Cloudtop District, you can see that her ivory tower, which once collapsed around you, is now standing in it's previous location, seemingly untouched and back to it's original esteemed visual."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That is the question, do we stop in first or do we go straight to –\nLIAM: Was there a time requested on there?","response":"DM: It said around the noon day sun. It's probably about 30 minutes give or take."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Allura's really the only person I trust.\nTALIESIN: Perhaps we should not walk into the palace with this on us, so to speak.\nLIAM: We don't have anything on us.\nTALIESIN: No, we don't, but if we did we should probably deal with it. What?\nLIAM: Yes.\nLIAM: Tibbsy. Let's go ring Allura's bell.\nTRAVIS: I'd like to ring her bell.\nTALIESIN: It's like having the internet right there.\nLIAM: So I just start walking off towards Allura's tower.\nORION: I'll follow Vax.","response":"DM: Okay. Everyone else go with them?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.\nASHLEY: Yeah.","response":"DM: So you guys trek your way towards the northern edge of the Cloudtop District. You round about the series of very nice, fine marbled houses, finely crafted stone. This is the affluent area of Emon proper. It's in the secondary city wall, which of course the upper echelon of merchants and those who have money are offered the secondary form of defense against the town being sieged at all. You come around the corner on the fine kind of yellowish cobblestone road, turn, and you get to the point where you can see to the left of you is the giant courtyard that surrounds the outskirts of the palace proper. With the giant steps that lead up to the darkened purple marble that the entire structure is made out of. To your right, there's a few buildings and the white ivory tower that Allura lives in. You approach, the front door is closed. It still remains that giant iron knocker on the front that hangs loosely, like a giant wishbone that you slam into the front of the wooden doorway. Give it a couple hits?"}
{"prompt":"(Vax nods)","response":"DM: You can hear it echo throughout the interior of the tall standing tower. A few moments pass, you hear the movement of chain. A creaking of metal and then a – some sort of large shifting of a wood platform or plank. The door then creaks open and there standing, a little bleary eyed, slept-in a bit, but in the process of getting ready, you see before you Arcanist Allura. Her long blonde hair is half braided. She's in her darkened blue robes. You're used to seeing her in and see – She opens the door, the sunlight hitting her eye. She protects her vision for a second before they focus on the rest of the group and she goes, “My lord, you've all arrived! You've all arrived!” And she swings the door open and runs forward immediately to you, the first person that's there and she gives you a big hug. She holds back and gives you a look over. Her eyes are opened. You can see how honestly eager and happy to see that everyone's here safe."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I look over at Tiberius and just short of sheepishly shrug.\nORION: I'm used to it, it's fine.","response":"DM: She turns over to give Pike a big hug. She makes her way around the rest of the group. “You're all… I'm so glad to see you're all back. I've heard there was some difficulties happening in Kraghammer at the time you arrived.” She turns around and takes your hands, Keyleth, into her own and gives you a nod and a small hug. Goes to Percy and gives you a hug. Goes to Tiberius and gives you a big warm hug. She slowly pulls away. She acquiesces to your longer hug… And then… pushes away."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It is nice to see you again.","response":"DM: “The pleasure is mine.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (sings) Awkward.","response":"DM: “The pleasure is mine, Tiberius.” And as she turns around, she sees standing behind the rest of you, there's Kima. There in her now freshly cleaned golden armor that she polished over the evening so she doesn't smell of Duergar sweat and blood anymore."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We've brought you a present.","response":"DM: There's this moment where they both look at each other quietly. And then Allura steps forward and says, “Kima. Welcome back.” And they both just run and give this big embracing bear hug. She lifts Kima up and there's a slow spin. You can see this very very strong bond of friendship before she eventually puts Kima down and takes a little bit, she holds her hands for a second. You can see a tear running down Allura's cheek. “I was so worried about you.” And Kima sheepishly turns her eyes to the side and says, “Sorry for the all the trouble.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Story of my life.\nORION: Seriously Matthew?! Come on!","response":"DM: What?!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Friends! Friends!\nORION: Friends.","response":"DM: Your assumptions, dragonborn."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Don't mug yourself.\nTALIESIN: That's great.\nLIAM: Come correct. Don't mug yourself.\nMARISHA: Allie?","response":"DM: And Allura starts heading back into her tower and says, “Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I like it.","response":"DM: \"Well? Come. Enter. I have tea ready. You all look like you could use it to be honest.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah.","response":"DM: “Come. Please.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I love tea.\nTALIESIN: We have a moment we can spend.\nLIAM: Long story.","response":"DM: So as you guys all walk into her tower, you remember it untouched from your previous entry here. It's a weird moment to step into a tower that you were once in as it crumbled and folded on itself, to see it as if nothing had ever happened."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is there a new rug?","response":"DM: There is not."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ah-hah!\nLAURA: Hmm..\nMARISHA: We're not giving it back.\nLAURA: We shouldn't tell her about the rug.\nMARISHA: Don't tell her about the rug.","response":"DM: You guys step into the center of the room and she's talking to herself for a moment, saying, “Things have been a bit crazy here, obviously. Now that the floodgates have opened as far as discussions with the council and people who have maintained a backlog for a while. It's been a bit busy. But, this is a wonderful moment to respite. I'm greatly enjoying the company to be honest. Come.” She guides you all to the center of the chamber. Once again, there's that large stone platform in the center that has a number of the inert runes carved into the stonework. As you all step onto it, she taps her heel against the bottom of it for a second. As she does, all the runes glow with a bright flash of blue and a familiar sensation as that circular platform begins to lift like an arcane elevator, up the center of the tower, going up one, two, three stories. And as you're going up you're seeing certain sections of wooden library shelves set up at odd angles along the top of the arcane tower itself. You can see there are small stairways that lead off into doorways that seem to almost exit into the sky. You've gotten into the idea that a lot of these powerful mage-built towers, the inner workings don't really match the outer exterior look. And there are rooms that shouldn't exist at certain points as you lift up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'd like to make a perfunctory insight check just to see if there's anything hinky.\nORION: I'd like to google perfunctory real quick.","response":"DM: You can do that. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: On Allura?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, everything's probably fine. That's an 18.","response":"DM: Best that you can gather, she looks like she's a bit groggy, having slept in recently. But she seems extremely excited you've all returned and seems eager to catch up as far as what has transpired since last you met her. The platform continues before it reaches the topmost floor of the tower before the slowing of the stone platform eventually comes to a halt with a slight jostling. The runes fade and you're all on the top floor of the tower once again. This is her main chamber. You can see across the way there is her large cush canopy bed in the far corner. There are a number of desks. There's a small arcane laboratory on the  far side. Looks like it's in a bit of disarray, as she's probably in the middle of a project. You do hear, as soon as you arrive, it sounds like the whistle of a tea kettle in the distance. At which point, she says, “Ah! Allow me.” And she begins to walk over. She lifts her hand and you see a small drift of arcane energy as her mage hand goes and lifts, takes the water off of its burner, and begins to absent mindedly mage-hand various teacups out of a large cabinet above the little kitchenette area."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: That's awesome.","response":"DM: At which point, everyone's looking around, Kima, amongst the rest of you guys, says, “It's been awhile since I've been here. Everything's as grandiose and unnecessarily dressed as it always is. I'm glad you got rid of that old rug though.”"}
{"prompt":"(scattered coughing)\nLIAM: Sorry. (coughs)\nASHLEY: Was there a rug?\nLIAM: I'm fine.\nTALIESIN: I don't remember that.\nMARISHA: Stay cool. Come on.\nTRAVIS: This rug?\nLAURA: Nope.\nTALIESIN: Nope.\nASHLEY: Nope.\nTALIESIN: Not here.","response":"DM: Allura, who is now in the process of pulling chairs over and setting up a small sitting arrangement, a semi-circle, and says--"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's so cute.\nORION: That was unfortunate.\nLIAM: Magic, it's tricky.\nORION: I had no idea. I jumped out when that happened.\nTALIESIN: Speaking of tricky magic.","response":"DM: She gives a slow, knowing look about the group. And gives a nod like, 'I acquiesce to this, that's fine'."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You should have some potted plants, Allura. Like some nice greenery.\nTALIESIN: You're going to try and feng shui the tower, is that what you–\nMARISHA: Well, why not.\nTALIESIN: I don't know.","response":"DM: “That's not a bad idea. Perhaps we'll discuss this.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is silly. Allura, it's a long story. Lot of deurgar, lot of mindflayer, lot of mindflayers, and an evil god?\nTALIESIN: A beholder.\nORION: Yes, moreover, a beholder.\nLIAM: Yes, but who was pulling the strings behind the beholder.\nMARISHA: He thought he was an evil god. A beholder with a god complex?","response":"DM: “Curious.” At which point, as you say that, she does this with her fingers, and all the chairs rush in underneath you guys. And you're put into a sitting position. As you all sit, she begins to slowly mage-hand over each one of you a freshly poured cup of tea. A look of concern comes across her face. “So you found your way beneath the city, I assume based on the denizens you've mentioned, into the Underdark proper. A beholder you say? Mindflayers you say?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: “I first off must apologize, I was not aware I was putting you into such dangerous territory.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ha! It was really dangerous! It was nothing, filled with just buttholes everywhere. Terrible.","response":"DM: “That sounds like a terrible city.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Mhm..","response":"DM: “Well, first and foremost, I apologize for that. I am incredibly grateful you're all seemingly healthy and still here. And you've brought Kima back to us which is very important. Well, I guess this is in order.” And she sits up for a second and walks over. And you can see she looks back at the rest of you and brushes her hand for a second. A sphere of darkness appears in the corner of the room where you can not see an entire part of the room. And she sits there and hovers. Just a little pocket of darkness."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Aw, man.\nASHLEY: What's that?","response":"DM: You hear some rustling."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We've been in darkness so long.","response":"DM: You hear some rustling. The sphere of darkness finishes and you see she's holding a sack of coins, that you don't know where she picked them up from."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh!","response":"DM: She steps back over to her chair, sits down, and says, “Just a precaution, I like to keep my private things private. But, a deal is a deal and you've done as you've asked. So as we've discussed, 10,000 gold pieces, to the lot of you, and my greatest thanks--”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I take that.","response":"DM: “--to the lot of you, and my greatest thanks.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good thing I'm strong then, huh?","response":"DM: With her nine strength, it sags."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sorry about the hand gesture there, stop it.","response":"DM: Internet. She sits back down, says, “You tell me what else if anything has transpired, and I'll let you know what you've missed.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Well.\nORION: We have Orcus's horn. So that's a thing.","response":"DM: There's a slight pause before the actual sound of breaking glass hits your ears as the teacup that she's holding shatters across the stonework on the floor. Allura, still sitting in her chair, hands in place and says “I'm sorry, what did you say?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, that beholder butthole that we had to fight, that we had no idea we had to fight, had this Orcus horn on his head. So we took it off and we kept it safe. That's what you wanted I'm assuming, to destroy it.\nLAURA: But we haven't touched it though.\nORION: No.\nORION: Yes.","response":"DM: “This must be brought before the council immediately.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wait.\nMARISHA: The council?\nORION: The council?","response":"DM: “The council of Tal'Dorei, the council you are part of.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: That helps.\nASHLEY: Are you going there, right now, also?","response":"DM: “Yes, I was summoned to it.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: We were as well.\nORION: Here's the thing. Sorry, Pike. The thing with this particular item is, the more people know about it, the more dangerous it actually becomes. The fact that we even share this information with Kima and with you is a very dangerous thing to begin with.","response":"DM: “I agree.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Are the council trustworthy?","response":"DM: “Those who currently reside on the council are trustworthy, I assure you this. I've done my work with them for many years, and those that have passed have been replaced with equally trustworthy individuals. And, rest assured, I have my checks and balances in place as well.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I think what we're worried about most is the corrupting nature of this thing. And while the council may have good intentions, I think more than a few of us are somewhat nervous what effect it might have on them, on us.","response":"DM: “Can you assess what the mistrust would be to not bring this before the sovereign and the council?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Namely, if the immediate want is for it to be immediately destroyed, because that's what needs to happen with anything from Orcus, as you very well know.","response":"DM: “I understand, and I don't think you'll find anyone who disagrees. But I also don't think you should sow mistrust with the council by keeping any of this information from them.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's not about trust.\nLAURA: Uriel has been corrupted once already.\nMARISHA: Exactly.","response":"DM: “This is true, and was it not by your hand that he was freed and his family kept safe? Understand, that this is a man that owes you him and his family's life. I think he would take in to you, his ear bent in your direction quite strongly.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Correct, but couldn't you also safely say that he is therefore fairly easy corruptible? If he had been corrupted before, even not if subconsciously, I'm not saying intentionally, but he clearly…","response":"DM: “You would know best what was responsible for corrupting our sovereign, as you did fight and one was felled, by it's own strength.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm saying Lady Allura, that there is essences, there seems to be magical properties to this horn that corrupt even some of the strongest willed individuals.","response":"DM: “Then we must be rid of it quickly. And I think we need to at least discuss this with the council, if not present it. Bring it to their attention. There are ways, arcane… not very approved ways, of nullifying targeted memories.” The rest of the Arcana Pansophical have banned the use of such magics but if we could have approval, understanding the safety concerns of this object from the council we could override the Arcana Pansophical and I could employ some of these magics to make sure that once this artifact is destroyed or taken somewhere to never be found again, we ourselves perhaps would not recall it ever existed. And that itself is the safest course of action.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I agree.\nLIAM: I think that we trust you. And you trust the council. That's enough for me.\nTALIESIN: That's enough for me as well.\nMARISHA: Pike? Where do you stand.\nORION: That's definitely enough for me.\nMARISHA: Pike? Where do you stand.\nORION: Just so you know Allura – I might have a solution as well for actually destroying it, so I will follow your lead.\nTALIESIN: I think the best course of action is to trust people.\nLIAM: And we're incapable of destroying the thing on our own.\nORION: Oh, that's not true at all. I might have a solution which I just shared with Allura. I'm letting her take the lead on this, and when the situation presents itself I might have a solution to destroy it outright.\nLAURA: Why don't you share that with us now Tiberius, instead of keeping it secret?\nLIAM: Just give us a rough sketch, maybe? instead of keeping it secret?\nORION: Very well. I'll pull out my bag of holding. This.\nMARISHA: The mending wheel?\nORION: No, the bag.\nLAURA: An empty fist?\nLIAM: He pulled out the bag.\nMARISHA: Okay. Would you care to elaborate, Tiberius?\nORION: I'm sorry. This part of the thing I wanted to tell all of you at breakfast. The idea is, with some research I've come to find that if anything is in a bag of holding, and the bag of holding itself is destroyed, the items or whatever go into a somewhat void, that cannot be retrieved by any one particular thing. If we are to have our memories erased, as you say, then it would guarantee that when we place the thing in a bag of holding and destroy that bag, it will then be dissipated into that void.","response":"DM: At which point, Allura raises her hand and says, “Tiberius. You, as a very trained sorcerer, have some knowledge in this regard. I've been crafting bags of holding since I was a child as a way of keeping my weekends busy. I have to notify you that should such a pocket of interdimensional arcane space is disrupted in this way, it doesn't send it into a void. It jettisons the contents into the Astral Sea. The Astral Sea which has many denizens that could come across this object. Githyanki themselves and their great ships.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I hate yankees.","response":"DM: “Gith –nevermind.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So it could be bad.\nORION: There are things –","response":"DM: “There are many things that exist in the Astral Sea that could recover this item. I'm not saying there isn't merit to this, but I think it would be best we put it somewhere where at least we know for certain no one will find it, as opposed to just hoping it disappears somewhere.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: But the memory thing is crucial.\nMARISHA: What about those who might be uncomfortable with toying around with my memories and tramping along around in my head, I don't really want –\nLIAM: Why don't you think about it for a while?\nTRAVIS: My head's pretty fragile as it is.\nLIAM: We're talking about erasing the path back to this thing, we're not talking about removing your adolescent years from your memory. Just this one thing.\nMARISHA: How many lessons have we learned in just the time. Wouldn't we have to erase all memories surrounding it? We wouldn't even remember our trip into the Underdark?\nTALIESIN: I think we could perhaps just erase the memory of where we put it.\nORION: That is what I assume will happen.","response":"DM: “That is possible. Like I've said, these magics have not been tampered with in nearly 200 years.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So we're gonna break the seal on some untampered-with magics and just experiment.","response":"DM: “I am part of a group that oversees civilization. I can't go into too much detail but they are responsible for keeping such ancient magics, long forgotten magics such as this. I would have to meet with and discuss and gain approval for its use. But for an item as dangerous as what you say, perhaps this is one of those special occasions.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She's working for the Illuminati and we're basically the A-team, so I think she might know a little better.\nTALIESIN: The A-team?\nMARISHA: What do you think, Pike?\nASHLEY: I feel like at this point we don't really have another option. And I do--\nORION: I'm all tapped out.\nASHLEY: And I do trust Allura. So I feel like if we just go check it out. I don't really know what our other option is. That was a good one.\nLIAM: And if we don't like it we can step.\nTALIESIN: And if we don't like it we can keep thinking of something else. We have time.","response":"DM: “This is true. And who knows what wisdom the rest of the council might have in their midst as well. They have members from all across the world. We'll see which resources they have at their disposal.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm sure they're waiting for us.","response":"DM: “I am glad to be free of my usual business. Are you guys familiar with the Wilder Fens?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sorry?","response":"DM: \"The Wilder Fens.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: “The Wilder Fens?","response":"DM: \"They're a bloody merchant guild. They've left our chambers in shambles. Look, since you've been gone and the council map has been brought up to speed once more, we've had to deal with the backlog of all the various council meetings that have been pushed back and pushed back for months and months. It's been rather nightmarish. So this, all dangerous as it is, I'm taking it as a nice change from the usual, pardon my speaking, political bullshit I've been dragged into on a weekly basis. Between Wilder Fens, and there was the Cortigian League from Wildemount, and they just tore through Emon with a caravan of partying gypsies that destroyed everything in their path.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Who?\nORION: Damn gypsies.","response":"DM: “The Cortian League. Cortigan League.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The Cortian League.","response":"DM: “From Wildemount, the north.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We fought stitch monsters, that was mostly what we… it was guns and swords and…","response":"DM: “It's far more interesting. Most of our guests have been a bit rough around the edges. Although I would say we did manage to meet with Syldor of Syngorn. We have some business there getting Syngorn situated.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, Syldor!","response":"DM: “And Lord and Lady Briarwood were rather nice to us when they came into the town. So, business has been… fair.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Shall we take this to the council then?\nLIAM: Yes, we have pressing matters. We'll get to that later.\nMARISHA: Say that one more time? Guardian who's a what now?","response":"DM: Guardian Tofor Brotoras."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: To-for?","response":"DM: T-O-F-O-R. Brotoras. Her name's been mentioned before but this is the first time you guys have actually seen her in person."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: It's a girl?","response":"DM: It's a female dragonborn paladin. She is adorned in full, silvered platinum plate. That has currently carved multiple symbols of Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. As she looks up and notices, you can see she gives a hand up, a symbol of greetings towards Kima. As Kima also gives her hand up and they both touch the front of their armor in a symbolic holy way, they both being followers of Bahamut. You immediately make that religious connection between the two of them. She looks across at the rest of the group there that she doesn't seem to notice, eyes meeting with Tiberius. This is strange. You haven't seen very many dragonborn at all within Emon, and as soon as she meets your gaze, she gives you a look of deep, deep stinkeye."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hello. My name is Tiberius Stormwind. Of House Stormwind, from Draconia.","response":"DM: (as Tofor) “From Draconia, you say?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes. I'm sure you've heard of my father Kravanas, my mother Penelope?","response":"DM: “And perhaps you should close that trap and sit across the table as far from me as possible.” She seems to spit the words almost, and sits back in her chair."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Mind your tongue.","response":"DM: The rest of the council's talking amongst themselves and hearing this slight discussion. Next to her there is a halfling male, in a ranger-ish garb, wearing what looks like some really fine chain shirt, with a thick dark black cloak. He is shaved bald with tattoos on one side of his face, and he introduces himself. “I'm terribly, sorry. I did not mean for there to be any sort of misunderstanding here.” He gives a slight nudge to Tofor. (as Seeker Assum) “I do not believe we've met at this time. My name is Seeker Assum Emring. I am the master of secrets here within the council.” He extends his hand towards you, almost like alleviating the tension."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hi. Stormwind here.","response":"DM: “I assume you're the ones we're waiting for. Please have a seat.” At which the sovereign finishes discussion with another human which you have not met. He is a built and armored individual, stands probably the tallest of the entire group, thick square jaw, unshaven. At which point he puts his hand on the sovereign's shoulder and says, (as  “I suppose I should introduce myself as well. I've heard much about you, Vox Machina. I am Arbiter Brom Goldhand. I have recently taken up as of three months ago the position that General Krieg once held within the city. Since he was unfortunately lost to us, there was a need for a new master of law. As since I've had a lot to keep up on. Unable to meet you personally until now, but it is a pleasure. I've heard nothing but great things.” He sits down in his chair. Allura finds her side of the table and gestures the rest of you. (as Allura) “Please, have a seat.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I stand. I don't sit.\nLIAM: If I may. We didn't choose to dump ourselves right in the middle of the city. That was born out of necessity, not out of choice. The task we set out to finish proved a lot more complicated than originally perceived. Frankly, I worry about the safety of the city of Kraghammer. Underneath their home down in the bowels of the earth, I'm don't know how much the council knows about the race of the illithid. We stumbled into a veritable hornets' nest of them below the city.","response":"DM: Most faces are blank. Allura has her hands on the table, listening intently. As you say illithid, you do notice that Seeker Assum Emring, the halfling, immediately sits back in his chair with a look of 'oh, snap'."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I see a lot of blank stares at this table. I wasn't very familiar with them either. There is an entire city in the Underdark beneath Kraghammer. And… in their midst was a beholder that was controlling the entire city. We ended up destroying it, barely escaping with our lives. Fleeing the city… destroying a god? I think.\nLAURA: I don't think we destroyed the god.\nORION: The beholder is merely a demi-demon.\nLAURA: Yes, it was something he had possessed, but the god still lives.\nLIAM: Yes, but Orcus was behind the beholder.\nMARISHA: We just have the horn.\nLIAM: We killed K'varn and then he got back up again. He didn't get himself back up.\nMARISHA: Because Orcus is a god of necromancy and undeath.\nORION: That's what the horn did. It brought him back to life when he would die. That's why I ripped it out when we did it because I knew that's what was going on. That's what the horn does.\nLIAM: I just worry that it's not just an appliance. It's got hidden in it something –\nLIAM: –is what I'm saying.","response":"DM: Allura looks at you strangely. “Tiberius, you sound different.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I was talking to –","response":"DM: I know."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Be that as it may we riled up a city of –\nTALIESIN: Mind flayers.\nLIAM: Buttholes as Tiberius would call them. Very unhappy race of things below the surface of the earth. Now, we're here today because Tiberius, crafty as he is, was able to flee ahead of us and create a portal back here. We ended up falling ass over tea kettle in the Lyceum, so here we are. (as Uriel) “Well, welcome back.”\nLIAM: Thank you.","response":"DM: “It's glad to see you're safe.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We've brought a little bit of the evil with us.\nLIAM: We have it stored safely away.\nMARISHA: Yes.\nLIAM: But this beholder… was using an artifact, a horn. Emanating darkness and shit. And Tiberius, in the heat of the battle, ripped it from its pate. And we brought it back with us.\nMARISHA: It is one of the two horns of Orcus.","response":"DM: At that notification, you say the name Orcus, and you can see there's a whole energy shift in the room at which point. A lot of furrowed brows drop to intense. The actual air of the room seems to go still for a moment. From what you can see, Seeker Assum and Tofor both grit their teeth and lean forward as you say this. Tofor says, “You said Orcus?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.\nORION: Are you deaf?\nMARISHA: Tiberius.\nTALIESIN: Manners.\nLIAM: We see the apprehension written on your faces and we are nervous as well. But the alternative was leaving the horn with these illithid. Hundreds if not thousands of illithid. We had to make a judgement call rather quickly, and… frankly leaving it there with them seemed like it wasn't an option.","response":"DM: (as Tofor) “You've done right in bringing it here. This has to be destroyed. Sent as far away– If this is indeed an artifact of Orcus, it cannot exist on this plane.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Plans must be drawn up.\nMARISHA: That's kind of what we thought.\nORION: Yes we knew this already.","response":"DM: At which point Kima steps forward and says “Now, understand this is not something you can lock in a box, or put some guards around it. There was a reason this was forgotten and needs to be again. With the proper surrounding strength and formidable individuals, I can take it to the Grand Chantry in Othanzia where the High Paladin Archibald will reseal it. Far away from the eyes and minds of the world. Lest we can come up with some sort of way to destroy this item.” At which point the Arbiter, Brom, steps forward, “If you think there's possibly a way to destroy this, we need to discover this here. We cannot allow it outside of the midst of this, to some chaotic winds and whim of the world around us. We have the walls of Emon to keep it safe. Why not take it to the Lyceum.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I want to make an insight check on the whole table.\nTRAVIS: Dang.\nTALIESIN: I want to also double-check, who was it that handed off the letter to the Briarwoods?","response":"DM: That was the Sovereign."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Sovereign? Thank you.","response":"DM: So which individual, the Arbiter?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, Arbiter Brom. What'd you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just a ten.","response":"DM: Ten?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I insight the Seeker?","response":"DM: Sure. What's your insight roll?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Thirteen.","response":"DM: Thirteen? Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I would like to insight the Sovereign just because, reasons.\nASHLEY: Yeah, we do.\nTALIESIN: One.","response":"DM: Starting the game off strong guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think you need some Florida rolling.\nTALIESIN: I'm just an idiot thinking.\nLAURA: I think you need some Florida rolling.\nLIAM: Yeah, I think so too. You're awfully quiet.\nLAURA: I'm going to insight check as well!  Because Matt can totally whisper to me if I get this good.\nLIAM: He'll text you.","response":"DM: I'll text it to you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Roll high.\nLAURA: Hold on, I'm looking.\nTRAVIS: She's rolling.\nLAURA: Seventeen.","response":"DM: Eleventeen?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Seventeen!\nLAURA: Seventeen!","response":"DM: A total of 17?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Eleventy-seven.\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: On which individual?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Which person at the table, sis?\nLAURA: You.\nLIAM: Your brother?\nLAURA: Oh no! On the deep voiced guy!\nASHLEY: The Arbiter.","response":"DM: Okay. Arbiter Braum."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, the arbiter.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You!\nLIAM: Why you gotta be like that, huh?","response":"DM: I'll say in a general feel about the room, but the arbiter specifically, There is definitely a very quick rising in tension, fear, and adrenaline in the room at this conversation. Fear is the main thing you're getting. I wouldn't say that you sense any deception. You just sense that the stakes have just suddenly jumped from what they were expecting their morning to be. They're trying to wrap their head around it. So nothing too particular catches your shit radar."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We are not leaving the horn here.\nLAURA: No..\nTALIESIN: We would have to leave you here.","response":"DM: As Grog speaks up for the Arbiter, he says, Arbiter Brom: “I'm not saying we leave it here. I'm saying that while we have it here, we have it studied. Bring it to the Lyceum. The headmaster and his entire research facility could possibly find a way to destroy it. There is no finer arcane focus than that lyceum in the city. They're responsible for the construction of our skyships. And the crystals that keep them elevated.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I love skyships.\nLAURA: I believe the power would be too great. It will corrupt. People will want to take it for themselves.","response":"DM: (as Brom) “Then it has to be taken elsewhere and sealed. Like Kima was requesting.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So you're saying essentially our two options are we can either keep it here and study it to try and figure out a way to destroy it and have all of the risks of this horn being inside the city or we take the other massive risks of trying to ship it off somewhere and hope that it gets sealed away?","response":"DM: At which point, Tofor the female dragonborn sits up in her chair and says, “Regardless. It should not stay here in my opinion. Understand the longer it resides within Emon, the more word will spread. And more despots will be drawn to our city to claim it. Do you wish to have all the darkness of this land slowly swarm in on the city?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I think we're of a like mind.\nORION: Yes.\nLIAM: I think we should take it from the city.\nMARISHA: I think it's a giant target on our backs right now.","response":"DM: At which point the sovereign who's been kinda quiet this moment, says, “Well. Best I can tell at this point, it should not stay in Emon. We've had enough trouble in this city and enough issues here that we're having to deal with in the aftermath of the attack on my family. We do not have the mental will nor the ability to withstand any sort of assault either from the inside or the outside of the city. If we are to take it elsewhere I trust the opinion of you, of Kima, and Allura.” At which point Allura takes a moment and says, “Just the knowledge of such a thing existing, let alone two, in this world is dangerous. Who knows what horrors an individual could achieve should they find both horns. Now, wherever this gets taken, the knowledge that all of us know that these exist now, and anyone else beyond this, means that that's a leak. That's a weakness. Now I've heard of some magics that can erase selective memories permanently. Ancient magics.”  At which point as she starts saying this, the rest of the room shifts uncomfortably. You can see Tofor begins to raise her hand to protest. Allura shuts her down and says, “But, I'd not employ these unless they were absolutely necessary. I need to speak with the Arcana Pansophical and see if this is such a strange and necessary circumstance to allow the use of such magics. That will take me some time to get the entire conclave to agree, but I think it's possible. It may be the only way, if we can not destroy this, to make sure that the rest of this world never knows that it existed. I think that's the safest route. As for getting it out of the city I feel that we have two individuals here, two followers of Bahamut, both the deity that saw the deity, brought the vision to Kima, and presented, whether in a roundabout way, the power and strength of these individuals to eventually retrieve it and prevent it from being an artifact that instrumentally destroyed the dwarven city and quite possibly all of Tal'Dorei. So I think if there was a god whose guidance we can look into, \"I would put my trust in the clergy of Bahamut.” She looks to Kima. Kima nods her head."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Of course we'd agree with such sentiments as well.","response":"DM: Kima raises her maul and says, \"Well then, if that's to be the case, I'll send word over to the rest of my temple. We'll send over our finest paladins, clerics, and guardians. Prepare a box for travel. We'll take it across the sea. Then we shall seal this bastard.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Kima.\nTRAVIS: Yeah! Oh. Sorry.\nORION: Kima, when you do approach your king, propose because Orcus's horn is pure black evil, perhaps the side of light can help as well. The blessing of Sarenrae and other light sources, divine powers, could be helpful as well.","response":"DM: (as Kima) “The horn will remain here until the vessel is brought over. But we have holy vessels specifically designed for the keeping of remains or things that are of great evil. We would gladly welcome the blessing of something from Sarenrae as well. After all, there is nothing wrong with more positive energy instilled to maintain such a negative force.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I personally don't trust this horn traveling anywhere without at least one of our supervision.","response":"DM: At which point the sovereign speaks up and says, “And to be completely honest, we are very grateful you've brought the horn here. But you are a motley crew. Who is to say any of you are also immune to this corruption as well? Who's to say you eight carry the mental willpower to withstand this darkness any better than a group of paladins designed and trained their entire lives to withstand and destroy this evil. What assurance do I have that your attachment to nature will not become some dark, brambled, twisted, thing in the proximity of this artifact? None. Just keep that in mind.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I look to the group and do this to Scanlan.\nTALIESIN: Taking quite advantage of his current state of mind.\nORION: You have no idea what I'm going to do for the rest of this game.\nTRAVIS: You literally do that to Scanlan. Like you… to Scanlan?\nORION: No, I was pointing at him.\nLIAM: Right in the ear.","response":"DM: Wet willy. To our little gnome bard."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Two weeks?!","response":"DM: At which point –"}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's 14 days, your highness.\nMARISHA: (sighs)\nLAURA: That was adorable.\nASHLEY: A fortnight?","response":"DM: At which point Allura stands forward and says, “It's in the means of –”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You guys don't have any holy ships here. You don't have like a ship dock?\nORION: I'm sure if they did they would probably use that one.\nTALIESIN: But I'm using it.","response":"DM: At this point Allura sits forward and to the rest of the group, says, “To be fair Kima, in my experience and knowledge, ships function well for the movement of goods and large objects. The speed of this requires some expediting and I happen to have a friend who is over in Othanzia, probably not far from your clergy. Perhaps we can facilitate a two-day travel?” At which point the group leans back for a second and Kima goes, “Well fine. Yeah, I guess.” Shoots a dirty look a little bit to –"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on Allura really quick?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She's saying a ship will be ready in two days or take two days to travel?","response":"DM: Allura's saying, “Depending on the size of this vessel, why do we even need a ship? We have the ability to transport between the cities. If we can pool our resources, there's no reason why we can't bring them here nearly instantaneously.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thirteen.","response":"DM: Thirteen? Best you can tell, Allura's really hard to read. She keeps up her smile but she definitely has her intense face on. She's deep in the moment. No  real gives one way or the other. The rest of the group looks around and Arcanist in the silence goes, “Well then, I think that me and Kima and Tofor, if you'd like, we can designate a way of bringing this relic container as fast as possible so we can get this going. I wish not to keep this within our presence much longer. Do we agree to that?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes.\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nLIAM: I think we would feel comfortable going along for the ride and seeing this thing through to the end.\nMARISHA: Okay.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to catch the sovereign on his way out.\nTRAVIS: Oh.\nLAURA: I wink at him.","response":"DM: He slyly winks back on his way out. As he exits, Tofor stands up. You've only seen her sitting since you arrived. As Tofor stands in her female dragonborn form, she is probably a good solid foot taller than Tiberius. And is a thick musclebound dragonborn paladin of Bahamut. Her armor shifts as she stands, she begins to make her way towards the door, not even with a glance in your direction."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That means she's as tall as you, Grog.\nTRAVIS: What?\nORION: She's as tall as you.\nMARISHA: I just whisper to Tiberius and say, Are all the ladies that big in Draconia?\nORION: It all depends. Not really.","response":"DM: She's bigger than usual."}
{"prompt":"ORION: She's a wretched peasant so I can not.\nMARISHA: That's so mean.\nLIAM: That's a little harsh.","response":"DM: Allura stands up and begins to leave. The sovereign stands up and as he stands up the guards come out and they come to his side."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Good Sovereign, if I can have a moment? Did I hear correctly that Lord and Lady Briarwood were in town?","response":"DM: (as Uriel) “They were but a week ago.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: They were but a week ago? And they've left, have they?","response":"DM: “Yes. Do you know of Lord and Lady Briarwood?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Just in passing. Did they have business in town? Was there something in particular? I'm just curious. It doesn't really matter. I mean it does matter but not particularly.","response":"DM: “It was relatively routine, we're establishing an official trade route through the northeast. Spanning the Boreal Plane to Whitestone.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh.","response":"DM: “They inherited the region after the unfortunate demise of the de Rolo family.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: “However our ambassador has noted that they've rebuilt rather well and honored the memory of the family and they're really committed to reestablishing the foothold of Whitestone in the north. So they came here on a diplomatic mission to open trade.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's nice. I would love to. Please, keep it quiet, but if I could be notified if they're coming through again. I would like very much to surprise them, if that would be possible.\nORION: Am I standing next to Percy? Am I hearing this?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Good.\nTALIESIN: It's just old business. It would be very interesting to see them again.","response":"DM: For the sake of this conversation, I'm going to ask you to roll a deception check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. Natural 20.\nORION: (claps)\nMARISHA: On the new pretty die.\nTALIESIN: Don't fuck with me.","response":"DM: The Sovereign gives you a look and says, “Certainly. Very well, I will notify you should they come through again.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Deeply honored by your thought, sir. Thank you.\nORION: At the end of this conversation I'm going to rip off a piece of the scroll of telescription and I'm going to approach. When you do, all you do is write the message to this and we will receive it. It's an enchanted parchment. I will receive the message.","response":"DM: He tells you, “I know how these work. Yes, thank you.” As you present it, he walks by and one of his guards takes it from you and gives you a nod. They exit the chambers. You guys are escorted out into the main hallway of the palace."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Bye!","response":"DM: The rest of the council scatters amongst the palace proper. You are all left. The doors close behind you and the echoing hallways towards the central left side of the palace."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (sighs)\nMARISHA: Percy.\nTALIESIN: I'm fine.\nASHLEY: Are you okay?\nMARISHA: You're sweating.\nTALIESIN: I know.\nASHLEY: Are you okay?\nMARISHA: Why are you sweating?\nTALIESIN: It's hot.\nMARISHA: What happened?\nTALIESIN: Nothing. The sun comes up and it gets very hot. I'll tell you later.\nORION: Very good.\nTALIESIN: This is discussion for later. There's more important things.","response":"DM: Kima and Allura are near you. At which point, Kima looks at the rest of you and says, “I apologize, I have to figure this out now. So I'm going to head to the nearest temple of Bahamut and see if we could reach out quickly.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What should we do?","response":"DM: \"That's up to you.\" She looks to Allura, questioning Allura. (as Allura) “In the event of this blessed chamber arriving, you will be notified. We will request your presence to bring the artifact in question, seal it, and then we will begin our journey over to its place of hopeful destruction and/or proper banishment.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Would you like anyone to go with you or you just want to go alone?","response":"DM: “To?”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: To work out the details of all of this?","response":"DM: Allura says, “For me, it's just preparation of the arcane transference ritual. I'm going to go meet with a friend of mine over in Othanzia.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I will say we haven't replenished our potions yet. And we could go –\nASHLEY: Should we go to visit our old friend?\nMARISHA: Gilmore?\nTALIESIN: We could go to Gilmore's.\nMARISHA: Gilmore?\nASHLEY: Gilmore?\nTALIESIN: We could go to Gilmore's.\nASHLEY: Gilmore's Glorious Goods?\nMARISHA: You essentially want us to wait?","response":"DM: “Whatever business you need to get done. It should take no more than two days to get this taken care of.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You guys, we have a weekend!\nLIAM: This is Allura and Kima who are here?","response":"DM: Yeah, they're the only two who have stayed behind with you guys outside of the council chambers."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I take Pike by the hand and I walk over to Kima. And they're short so I kneel down. I say to the both of them: I've never pretended to be a man of the cloth, I know little of the gods. But the brush we had down below has left me shaken. What can the gods tell us? The gods stick their noses into our doings whenever it pleases them. Are they not here? Have they anything to say for what is happening now?\nMARISHA: I'm with this guy! High five Vax.","response":"DM: At which point– did you wish to respond in any way?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Well, I just know that I tried to have a response from my god down below and she didn't really respond the way I would have liked for her to. But maybe things will be different. What were you going to say?","response":"DM: At which point Kima looks to you, at what you just said with curious worry. “Well, if what you say is your faith has been shaken, there is always room at the temple of Bahamut to find redemption, strength, and guidance. You realize the platinum –”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: She's trying to get you to come to her church.\nASHLEY: She's trying to convert.\nMARISHA: She's trying to convert! Get the leaflet.","response":"DM: (as Kima) “The platinum dragon has guided much of civilization's growth, expansion, and survival for thousands of years. The eternal battle between him and the darkness that is Tiamat and the chaos beyond that –”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: With all due respect, Kima, I don't think that was Vax's question.","response":"DM: “To get to the point, I apologize. The gods are many and the gods have been at war for as long as we exist. There are some that believe we are nothing but the aftermath of their squabbles. But nevertheless, there is much good in this world that guides us to our ultimate destiny. And if you yourself ever feel that you are lost amongst this chaos, don't ever be afraid to stop in and ask a few questions.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I was just wondering if I could ask you to ask them, to maybe help. I would never think to ask the gods for help if I wanted a shiny new sword or pile of riches, but this is something different.\nTRAVIS: Unless they could get us a pile of riches.\nLAURA: Or a shining sword.\nLIAM: Good boy.\nASHLEY: That's a really good point. I guess that's a positive way to look at it.\nMARISHA: I really like long walks in the forest when I'm feeling disconnected.\nASHLEY: That works too, you know.\nTRAVIS: Lady Kima, do the gods allow you to have relationships?","response":"DM: Kima, you ask this and she gives you a look of confusion, and then… She already a darker complexion for a halfling but her cheeks grow noticeably ruddier. She averts her gaze and says, “Well…”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I start trying to do my best Vax wink.\nLAURA: I'm Vex.\nTRAVIS: –Vex wink.","response":"DM: She averts her gaze and goes, “Well, as far as I know it is not a vow of chastity within the order.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So you're saying there's a chance.","response":"DM: She still is looking away. She looks away and looks to the rest of you. Looks to Allura. Looks to you again. And then goes, “I really have to get to work on this.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You did this.","response":"DM: “I really have to get to work on this.” She leaves the group and continues down the hallway. Quick steps."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Bye, Kima!\nLIAM: A lot of math involved in that equation.\nMARISHA: Yeah…","response":"DM: Allura chuckles to herself and steps into the place where she was and goes--"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I care not to solve the puzzle.","response":"DM: (as Allura) “Oh, as a note. Be careful who you ask those questions to, you may get an earful.” And Allura smiles and motions towards Kima. “Don't get me wrong, you're more than welcome to explore as you like, but that's a rabbit hole my friend.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A rabbit hole, is that what we're calling it these days?","response":"DM: You feel a gentle slap from some unknown arcane force across your cheek Grog. And Allura gives you a stern glare."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, don't talk about her girl that way.\nLIAM: Don't make me take my earrings off.","response":"DM: Anyway. “So two days. We'll call for you when the item is to be transferred and properly brought to its destination. In the meantime, prepare as you see fit, enjoy this well-earned rest, and we'll take it from there. I have much travel to do myself. See you all very soon.” She begins to step up the hallway. As she steps up the hallway, you can see there's a light yellowish glow about her form. Then with a sudden flash of white light, Allura's just gone."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So guys. I'm thinking we take a local tour of all the historical highlights of Emon. We've never really gone sightseeing, Then maybe we can catch a nice dinner in the city tonight.\nLAURA: Oh, look at the time.\nTRAVIS: Oh, it's getting so late.\nMARISHA: It's 1pm. We've got the whole day\nTALIESIN: It feels like eight. It really feels so late.\nMARISHA: I picked up one of these pamphlets while we were in the palace and apparently there's a nice natural history museum.\nTALIESIN: Gilmore's? Gilmore's?\nORION: Your highness, what is a pam-phlet?\nTALIESIN: Gilmore's?\nORION: Oh, a lot of paper.\nTALIESIN: I'll be at Gilmore's.\nORION: Oh, it's like a mini book!\nMARISHA: It's like a tiny scroll.\nORION: It has pictures!\nMARISHA: Yes!\nORION: Look, Percy!\nTALIESIN: I'm already heading towards Gilmore's.\nLIAM: I'm following Percy.\nTRAVIS: We're going to Gilmore's, too.","response":"DM: Hey guys, welcome back. We're about to get in some game time again here in a second, but first we have our second winner to win the second horn of Orcus for the evening's giveaway. We're really excited to announce the winner of the second player's handbook signed by the group, the dice kit, as well as this horn, is Ember72. Ember72, congratulations."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Ember72!","response":"DM: You get to have this one. It's awesome, really stoked. We now have both of these horns given away. And while these are the only horns of Orcus that'll be out there, our fantastic propmaster over here, Kai, Kommissar Props, will be working with us in the future to do more Critical Role-based prop giveaways. And once again, definitely check out his work, he's an amazing fabricator and propmaster. ASHLEY: Those are the only two? he's an amazing fabricator and propmaster. These are the only two that're gonna go out."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: They're the only two in the world.\nASHLEY: That's really special.\nTALIESIN: They're the only two in the world.\nZAC: At 3,600 we'll do the starter kit, t-shirt –\nASHLEY: That sounded insincere, but I really meant it.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That did sound insincere.","response":"DM: We'll see somewhere down the road. If we want to put out more stuff, we'll see. But right now these are just an exclusive giveaway. Excited for those two guys. So everyone once again for Rhymeswithorange and Ember72, congratulations on those bits."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Or maybe if you follow Kommissar Props, we'll do another giveaway to the people who follow him.","response":"DM: Helping friends out because they do awesome work. Congratulations on that. If we can get to 3,600 we're gonna be doing some dance after the show, so hopefully we can hit that subscriber number tonight."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Plus giveaway.\nASHLEY: Gilmore!","response":"DM: So you guys, you make your way outside of the Castletop District into the center of Emon proper. Returning to Abedar's Promenade, which is the largest central section of the city, where most of the merchantile itself seems to have gathered and been a serious conglomerate where all business in this city happens. Those who would like a quick little visual idea of the city, this is Emon. Right there. It's a small little – there is an amazing printout of this that they've, actually Laura and Travis, have framed and put up in their room sometime. We'll have to go ahead and bring on the show and show you guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're gonna bring it to put on the set. At some point.","response":"DM: Yeah, we'll have it too. Anyway, the Castletop District is here, the inner portion. You guys have made your way out south to the Central District and then towards Abedar's Promenade, which is right over here. So you guys would've gone this way, actually. So you're out to Abedar's Promenade in the far eastern side of Emon, where you eventually find your way to the outskirts of your favorite purveyor of arcane mystical artifacts."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Gilmore!","response":"DM: Shaun Gilmore himself."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Shaun Gilmore.","response":"DM: So as you guys –"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Is that his first name?\nMARISHA: I didn't know Shaun was his first name either.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I didn't know Shaun was his first name either.\nTALIESIN: You've not been paying attention.","response":"DM: Shaun Gilmore, but you've always called him Gilmore."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We're on a first-name basis now, guys.","response":"DM: No one's on a first-name basis with Gilmore."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We are.","response":"DM: Gilmore is Gilmore."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Except for maybe Vax over there.","response":"DM: Except for maybe, maybe Vax. So at this point now you're pushing about two in the afternoon. It's extremely busy, you can hear the clopping of horse hooves on the ground, people are walking past. You'd swear as you're stepping through the city, maybe a handful of people tend to stop and watch you guys walk through, stunned. Almost like they'd seen a celebrity on the street, as the most recent makeup of the Winter's Crest festival was a celebration of you being the heroes who saved the city of Emon and the sovereign and his family. Apparently you are now recognizable within the city of Emon."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: My sister winks.\nTRAVIS: Yeah we are.\nLAURA: I do.\nLAURA: Other way.","response":"DM: Perfect, there you go."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Just a little more.\nTRAVIS: Ugh!","response":"DM: Like a terrible medieval Sephora."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Like coming home.\nASHLEY: Medieval Sephora.","response":"DM: A series of magically flickering ever-burning candles adorn sconces along the walls. You can see there are glass cases set out in the center of the room, there is the long wooden bar on the far end which has itself its own beaded curtain that is closed, and there are three employees of Gilmore's Glorious Goods in their ceremonial blue and purple robes that match the exterior, staring about while there a number of other possible customers that are looking about. There are numerous bookshelves along the walls. You can see there is, next to the stairway on the far left side of this floor, there is an herbalist who specializes in dried herbs and sales in that regard. You haven't been to the upstairs yet in this complex. But you now are standing back in the comfortable, although slightly offensive to your senses, interior of Gilmore's Glorious Goods."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm scanning the entire store for him. I want to find him.","response":"DM: He's not currently visible."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh! He's not here?","response":"DM: He's not visible. Not in the main room."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: He has his private office.\nLAURA: Brother.\nASHLEY: He has his private office.\nLIAM: Yes?\nLAURA: You should get that evil Clarota helmet checked out and see what all good it does us.\nLIAM: What, this one?\nLAURA: Yep. That one.\nLIAM: Yes.\nMARISHA: Vax.\nLIAM: Yes?\nMARISHA: I say you'd be the point man here.\nLIAM: I think so.\nORION: I would agree.\nASHLEY: I think that's a really good plan.\nTALIESIN: I second that notion. Quintuple it.\nMARISHA: Yeah. The twinsies should go.\nLIAM: Start looking around. Start shopping. Don't pay for anything yet, because I have an arrangement.\nASHLEY: He can get a little discount.\nLAURA: He can get a little wink, wink, nudge, nudge discount.\nMARISHA: I go up to Vax. I put my hands on his shoulders, and I say, You got this. And I cast Enhance Ability on him.\nASHLEY: Yeah.\nMARISHA: For charisma? I'm assuming?\nLIAM: Let's make my hair even glossier than it already is.\nMARISHA: And I give him a little bit of the dad thumb.\nLIAM: I know that thumb.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: The dad thumb?\nMARISHA: Wipe the morning breakfast off of him before I send him on to school.\nMARISHA: And I give him a little love tap on his behind and send him on his way.\nASHLEY: Send him on his merry way.\nTALIESIN: Shoulder massage.\nMARISHA: So you have advantage rolls on all charisma rolls.\nLIAM: Is there a front desk?\nORION: (package crinkling)\nLIAM: Is there a front desk?","response":"DM: On the far back side, there is a very long, well-crafted dark wood desk that is adorned with what looks like small alchemical components, (package crinkling) with what looks like small alchemical components, glass tubing and – (package crinkling) Be a little louder with those Red Vines."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sorry. Do you want one?","response":"DM: I'm good, thank you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm sorry, he's looking for Gilmore.\nLIAM: They're going to flirt together.\nORION: It's like watching a movie.\nMARISHA: (giggles)\nLIAM: Sorry.\nLIAM: Okay, and there's a person manning the –","response":"DM: No, not currently. It is just an empty desk."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is there a bell or anything?","response":"DM: There is a bell."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: As you hit the bell, one of the employees who is helping somebody looks around and goes, “I'm sorry.” What you see is a half-elven woman with thick spectacles who is currently stepping over to try and stop you. However, the beaded curtain swishes open with the grandiose gesture of one slightly meaty hand. Stepping out in his fine, gold-trimmed, purple robes, his longish thick, black, coarse hair pulled into a nice ponytail. Smoothly-shaved face with a slight hint of a braided goatee that dangles about three inches from his chin."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Will you remind me because it's been a while. Gilmore's a good-looking man, though, isn't he?","response":"DM: Yeah. He's handsome."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Is the braid new? Is that a new addition?\nLAURA: He's so handsome, Vax.\nMARISHA: The braid's new. He decided to rock the braid. Go for it!","response":"DM: Gilmore's a very handsome gentleman. I would say he's not fit and muscular. He is a handsome, comfortably jovial gentleman."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm picturing Jeremy Irons in a wizard robe.","response":"DM: Kind of. Imagine him with a little more paunch."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: But very charismatic. Open chest to his vest, with a number of gold chains and medallions that dangle around."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I feel you.","response":"DM: It's almost like a wizard's track suit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You ruined it for me, man!\nTALIESIN: And it's dead.\nMARISHA: Please tell me it says “arcane” on the butt?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes.","response":"DM: He immediately looks and goes, “Oh. You've returned.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Gilmore, you glorious bastard. How have you been?","response":"DM: He immediately rushes to the edge and leans over the counter to give you a grandiose hug and actually lifts you off your feet. Much stronger than you anticipated. He goes, “Oh, Vax'ahlia. It's been far too long.” He sets you down next to him behind the counter and gives you a big hug, his strong wizard arms around you. A scent of what's almost like fine herbs with a hint of patchouli enters your nose."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You naughty man. You just called me by my sister's name. That is going to cost you.\nMARISHA: (gasps)","response":"DM: “I said Vax! What do you mean?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I heard \"Vex'ahlia.”","response":"DM: \"That's ridiculous. Preposterous.“"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Can we go to the videotape? Anyone?\nMARISHA: Instant replay!\nORION: Actually, Vax, he was correct. He said your name correctly. I believe you owe him a little something now.\nMARISHA: I think it was a little bit of combination. A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B. I think he called you Vex'ahlia.\nLIAM: Water under the bridge.\nMARISHA: Or Vax'ahlia, is what he called you.\nORION: He called you Vax'ahlia, which I call you in my sleep.\nLIAM: Shut up, you. I lean in.","response":"DM: He looks genuinely perturbed and embarrassed by the whole circumstance. \"I –”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I lean in. I pat him on the hand. Don't you worry. We have come from far and away. You would not believe the shit we have been through, but I don't want to talk about me. I want to talk about you. What has been going on in this city since we've been gone?","response":"DM: “Well.” And he looks about the rest of you and says, “Obviously you've brought the rest of your friends here. Come, sit! Story time, story time!”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Fantastic.","response":"DM: “We have been doing marvelously. Trade has opened up wide in Emon. We've had travelers from all over Tal'Dorei and beyond. It's incredible.”"}
{"prompt":"(all giggle)","response":"DM: “I'm in the process of planning an expansion to another town. Perhaps even –”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, my.","response":"DM: “–perhaps even opening a second store in Westruun.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You're going to own a chain?\nORION: Congratulations!","response":"DM: “Perhaps.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: This is a big step for any businessman.\nTALIESIN: Spectacular.","response":"DM: “But yes. No, I have been able to take on two more arcanists. We've been in the process of designing some more interesting, wondrous items. We have stocked many of our recent possible and available items. We are doing quite well for ourselves.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Are you looking for investors, Gilmore?","response":"DM: “I technically am your investor, in a way.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh.\nLAURA: He is.\nMARISHA: True, we are sponsored by him.","response":"DM: “But. If you have the money in which to sponsor our business, that's a whole other discussion.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I just wanted you to talk to me for a little bit. Vax, take it away.","response":"DM: “Dragonborn. But yes! How about yourselves? You look like you've –” He gives you all a look over. “–like you've maybe not slept in a fortnight.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well. We're lucky we're not dead. It came close a couple of times. We were off on official business for the emperor. We've been underground for weeks and weeks. We've only seen the sun for a couple of days.","response":"DM: “Oh. That kind of a weekend. I know how that goes.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Needless to say, our stores are terribly depleted. We are going to need to stock up a bit before we head out of town again. I don't want to rush things, though. I think my friends probably want to shop about. My sister can probably handle things for me. I would love to take a stroll with you around the city. Get a bit of lunch, a bite, and hear about what's been happening. Hear the rumors of town. We all know nobody matches your shrewdness in business. That's no surprise.","response":"DM: (chuckles)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But I'm wondering what you've heard. What's on the wind? Can you take the afternoon off?","response":"DM: He looks over at the same half-elven woman who was trying to stop you earlier. She gives a look like, 'what's he going to say?' No one's ever asked him this question. He goes, “For you? Of course.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Man date. Go for it!\nLAURA: Don't worry, Gilmore. We'll take wonderful care of your employees.","response":"DM: “Well if you wish to do business, why not do that now?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We need to shop around first, of course.","response":"DM: “Very well.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And we're so curious as to any of these interesting and fascinating things that you've developed in the several weeks it's been since we've been here. We'd love to see what you've been working on.","response":"DM: “Very well. Sherri!” The same woman, her shoulders droop. “Yes, Gilmore?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I think this will take a while. Let's.\nLAURA: Have a wonderful time, brother.\nLIAM: I look to my sister as we go. Just get what I need, will you?\nLAURA: Of course.\nLIAM: Thank you. And stroll out the door with Gilmore. Have at it, ladies and gentlemen.\nTRAVIS: Yes!\nMARISHA: We'll leave dinner on the stove for you.","response":"DM: So Sherri looks at the rest of you as they leave and goes, “So you're all friends of Gilmore, then?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes.\nASHLEY: Business friends.\nMARISHA: We're mutual fans of one another, if you will.","response":"DM: She adjusts her glasses. “Then let's continue with the business. What are you seeking? What do you need? What are you looking for?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I don't know. We like all kinds of things.\nMARISHA: Well, we definitely need potions.","response":"DM: “Potions. Those we can provide.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Health potions.","response":"DM: “Health potions, yes. Potions of healing can be provided.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What do you have right now?\nASHLEY: What's the price on the superior healing, again?\nORION: We'll take the lot.\nASHLEY: What's the price on the superior healing, again?","response":"DM: “Superior healing? Let's see, currently those go for about –” She looks at the price book, going through. “Those will run you –” As I go through my price book."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: We are sponsored.\nTALIESIN: We do keep getting turned to stone. This has been a problem, and it's been sticking around a bit. I feel like we should maybe take some precautions for the inevitable next time this happens.","response":"DM: “That will be 1,500 gold pieces per superior.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is that with our sponsorship prices?","response":"DM: “Right, you mentioned you're sponsored. That would be a 10% discount. That would bring it to about 1,350, should you wish to purchase them individually.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.\nTRAVIS: I definitely need one of those.\nLAURA: Wait. How much if we're purchasing them individually?","response":"DM: “1,350 gold pieces per superior healing potion.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: How much for the lot?\nLAURA: And if we buy in bulk, what can you bring it down to?","response":"DM: “If you buy all three?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: A thousand each?","response":"DM: “I'm sorry. You've already been given the discount via Gilmore. That price stands as it is. Let's say you buy the three remaining items, I'll give you 1,200 apiece. And even that I'll probably get in trouble for, but he seems to like you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 1,200 apiece? Yes?\nTRAVIS: We'll take that.\nTALIESIN: Sounds good.\nLAURA: Three superior.","response":"DM: “Very well. So 3,600 gold pieces. Three superior are yours.” She pulls them out of the crate and slides them across. They are thick, very heavily-made glass vials with these small glass handles on the side. You can see the interior. The liquid itself is a reddish purple, almost blood color, but there's a gold sheen as you shake it in the light. You can see there's a spark of divine glow to it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Like Goldschlager.\nTALIESIN: Classy.","response":"DM: Kind of. It's the worst of healing Goldschlager."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you sell any love potions?","response":"DM: She gives you the blank stare and goes, “No.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right. Sorry for asking. Jeez.\nTALIESIN: I would also say we should take the six superior healing potions, as well.\nORION: Absolutely.","response":"DM: “The greater ones.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Greater.\nLAURA: What did we just buy? We didn't buy superior?\nTALIESIN: We bought the three superior. We should also get the six greater.","response":"DM: “Those are 500 apiece. With your discount, that would be 450 apiece.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But if we're buying all six, 400 apiece is a very good price.\nORION: Now, this is the Vex I miss.","response":"DM: Roll a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA, ORION, AND TALIESIN: Persuasion check, persuasion check!\nLIAM: Vex hasn't had a chance to haggle since the show started.\nMARISHA: Yep.\nLIAM: All she used to do before this show was haggle.\nMARISHA: We used to take food breaks. No!\nLAURA: Fourteen.","response":"DM: Fourteen? She goes, “Let's call it an even 425 gold pieces each.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I like this. I'm comfortable with that.\nTALIESIN: 425 times six…","response":"DM: She brings out her arcane calculator."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Her arcane calculator? Once again, our charity.","response":"DM: “That'll be 2,550 gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Careful with those.","response":"DM: “They're fine, they can take a beating, they're designed that way.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So can I.","response":"DM: She pushes her glasses up and looks vastly unimpressed at the presentation."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How much were the superiors again?","response":"DM: “The superiors were 1,500 brought down to 1,200 apiece, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 1,200. Which came to 36?","response":"DM: “We do have potions of petrification removal.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes! Petrification removal.","response":"DM: I think. Let me check. And she goes in the back room, rummages around for a minute, comes out and she presents two of them. They have a clear liquid that looks almost like dirty water, and they're like thin little vials, she goes, “These potions, when applied to the flesh, will, more of an oil I guess you would say, removes the affliction of petrification. These do cost 750 gold apiece.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We have greater restoration from Pike, and she can cure –","response":"DM: “Then you're fine.” And she takes them –"}
{"prompt":"ORION: How many potions are there?","response":"DM: “Two.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But in the heat of the moment.\nORION: Get them.\nTALIESIN: In the heat of the moment, it might come quite in handy.\nLIAM: A stone Grog in the middle of a fight?\nTRAVIS: I agree.\nORION: It takes her a day to learn that and she can only do it like once or twice at the most.\nTRAVIS: I think we need to get it.\nTALIESIN: I'd rather have the potions than the gold, to be fair.\nMARISHA: Let's just get one.\nTALIESIN: And we haven't discussed our discount.\nMARISHA: I should learn how to make potions. I should learn this.\nLIAM: Money is meant for spending.\nLAURA: Do we want to take one?\nORION: Take both.\nTALIESIN: I'd actually say we take both.\nLIAM: Not that I'm here.\nLAURA: Take both. 750 was not the discounted price.\nORION: No.","response":"DM: She gives you another look of like, ugh. She adjusts her glasses."}
{"prompt":"ORION: To be fair, we are spending a lot, right? Overall, so.\nASHLEY: Overall.","response":"DM: “That would come to 1,350.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Thirteen fifty.\nTRAVIS: We'll take it.\nLAURA: 1,300. Remember, we're very good friends of Gilmore's, he said to treat us well.","response":"DM: Make another persuasion roll. This is my new fan dice."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That was really good.","response":"DM: It's awesome, thank you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That would be 21.","response":"DM: It's a good thing. She gives you a look and goes, “I don't like you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Thirteen hundred, lovely, thank you.\nMARISHA: Sherri? It was Sherri, right?","response":"DM: “Yes?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do you have any books on how to learn how to start making your own potions? Or do you know of any classes in town where maybe I could sign up for like a potion workshop?","response":"DM: “Nothing here, but that's not a bad idea, might run that past Gilmore.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You should offer a workshop.\nMARISHA: You should absolutely offer a workshop.","response":"DM: “That's a good idea,"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You should absolutely offer a workshop.","response":"DM: \"Otherwise the Lyceum would be the place to look.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The Lyceum?","response":"DM: “Yes.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nORION: Do you have any potions of strength or any ability potions?","response":"DM: She leaves for a second, then comes back and goes, “No, I'm afraid those were all purchased. However, we may have more in a few weeks or so. They take some time to create and the ingredients are a little bit scarce. However, trade is opening, perhaps –”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Someone purchased all of your potion of strength potions?","response":"DM: “Yes.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh. How many did you have?","response":"DM: “We had four, I believe. Varying giant strength types.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: One person did or it was just a bunch of people just buying.","response":"DM: “It was a handful over the period of time.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh.\nORION: I'm gonna hand her also a ticket, a scroll of telescription and be like, When it comes in, please write that it has and I will be notified via this parchment.","response":"DM: “Very well.” She folds it and places it in a little cubby on the side."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Thank you.","response":"DM: “Is there anything else you require? We have many magical, various armaments and/or protective items.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Armaments, what kind of armaments you got?","response":"DM: “Well, if you'll follow me.” She leads you up the stairway to the second floor. The second floor itself is just a series of glass cases that are leaned at an angle. In these cases you can see there are different items just laid out, small labels at the bottom with--"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh.","response":"DM: --a brief description of the enchantment. She leads you across, she goes, “Well, first we'll start here with the ring section.” You can see there's a small case that has along this purplish velvet pillow, a bunch of different rings set out. She goes, “We have varying degrees of rings of protection. These rings are designed to protect the individual who wears, we have one I believe with the basic enchantment, and one with one step higher above that.” The equivalent of a ring of protection plus two. “That ring runs 6,500 gold. We have a ring of psychic resistance that does protect yourself from various mental intrusions. We have a ring of evasion that can be utilized three times a day, or one to three times a day. Should one of you not be quite quick enough to avoid any sort of incoming danger. You  could allow yourself a successful escape. That runs 4,500. We also have a ring of water walking. This one has been popular in the past for some various traveling troupes that wish to do various performances that require defying the surface of water. It gets a bit shifty now that I think about it, but you know, whatever folks will enjoy. Peasantry is easily pleased. So those are our rings at the moment. Should any of those tickle your fancy, please do let me know. Here –” And she points over where there is a thick leather belt with like three straps across that looks highly well made with what looks like square runic carvings on the side. “–this is what is referred to, and this was import from Kraghammer, but we've had it in here for quite some time, a belt of dwarvenkind. This belt, when adorned, does increase the physical heartiness of the individual as well as giving them positive interaction with other dwarves. And we haven't fully tested it yet, but apparently it also seems to resist against poison intrusion in one's body, allows you to see better in dark places, and apparently grants you the ability of speaking, reading, and writing Dwarvish.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh wow.\nMARISHA: I need that.","response":"DM: It is 5,000 gold."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I bet that's very expensive…\nLIAM: One month ago you needed that.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nASHLEY: What was the first ring?\nTRAVIS: Ring of protection.","response":"DM: “The first ring was the ring of protection.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Plus two, right?","response":"DM: It gives a plus two bonus to AC and saving throws."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's really good.\nASHLEY: What was the evasion one?","response":"DM: “That one, that's the ring of evasion.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yes, what was that?","response":"DM: It has three charges and it regains 1d3 charges per day. When you fail a dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction to expend a charge and auto-succeed on the saving throw instead. Good for people who have low dexterity."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The one that protects you psychically, could you repeat that one on the menu, please?","response":"DM: “The ring of psychic resistance –”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh god.","response":"DM: It gives you resistance to psychic damage, so anyone does damage that is psychic-based, you take half damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's not quite it.\nTRAVIS: It's not good?\nLAURA: No, it's not quite the same.\nTRAVIS: Not even for me?\nLAURA: Do you have anything to make Grog smarter?\nTRAVIS: Well, fuck off.","response":"DM: She looks over at him for a moment and goes, \"No. No we don't.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Any crayons so he could be occupied?\nTRAVIS: Do you have crayons?","response":"DM: “We have colored writing implements for children, if you'd like.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, please.\nTRAVIS: I saw a few children in town. Maybe they would like them.","response":"DM: She goes back downstairs and comes back in a moment. She presents two small boxes that contain small colored wax things. You can see on the outside it has a picture of Gilmore, and he's doing this, and it says Gilmore's Glorious Colored Sticks."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Of course.","response":"DM: “These are usually reserved for the children of our customers, so if the children will enjoy it, enjoy.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'll take one of those, please.\nMARISHA: Yes, trust me –\nTRAVIS: The colors are quite nice.\nMARISHA: –the children will.","response":"DM: “Five gold pieces apiece.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Five gold pieces apiece? I thought they were free, like when you go to an O'Charley's or an Applebee's.","response":"DM: “What's an Applebee's?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's a hellhole, apparently near where you used to live.","response":"DM: It's one of the layers of the Abyss, it's like around –"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: One of the infernal layers of the Abyss.","response":"DM: About layer 943."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's getting pretty low, yeah.\nASHLEY: So I've been talking with Scanlan and I know he was interested in the plus two AC ring.\nMARISHA: I think we should pick that up for sure.\nASHLEY: What's the price on that?","response":"DM: “Sixty five hundredd gold pieces for that.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: “With your discount, that would bring it –” Goes back and looks again at her magic calculator, I'm an actor not –"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's an abacus.","response":"DM: Exactly. “That brings it to 5,850.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Well, he does have this amazing ruby gem. He was maybe thinking of trading that for maybe bringing down the price?","response":"DM: Do we know how much that was worth?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Uh.","response":"DM: Has Scanlan looked at his sheet and found what it's worth?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Scanlan? Speak up,\nASHLEY: Scanlan,\nLIAM: Do you know how much it's worth? I think you wrote it down. He's talking quietly.","response":"DM: There was the diamond also that was repaired in the mending wheel. He can look that up as well."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: There was a diamond.\nLIAM: Vex, do you remember how much that diamond was worth, we got that diamond –","response":"DM: Oh no, we lost them."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We lost them.\nMARISHA: Oh no!","response":"DM: Redial, redial!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: This is important!\nLIAM: I got it.\nMARISHA: How much is the diamond worth?","response":"DM: “Regardless. Other things of interest, nothing that would make him smarter, that would make him quicker.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is so period. It's just like Lord of the Rings. Beep beep beep.","response":"DM: Magical sending stone."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: God damn it!\nMARISHA: Answer!","response":"DM: Answer your Facetime."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Answer, bitches.","response":"DM: Vex!"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I hate when you call and you know that they're there and they don't pick up.","response":"DM: We'll come to it. so I'm just gonna keep doing this, as you were. “Regardless.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We know you're there!","response":"DM: She continues on, showing you through, she goes, “Well, I don't necessarily have anything that would make him smarter. We do have something that would make anyone quicker.” She goes a second, there is a big, thick leather tome. “This is an ancient tome that was enchanted many, many generations back. Upon properly reading and studying this tome, one would increase their physical dexterity permanently.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I like that.","response":"DM: “It only has its abilities and power once a century, so it does come quite pricey.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What is that price?","response":"DM: “Fifteen hundred gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We should buy that.\nASHLEY: We should probably buy it.\nMARISHA: A tome that increases your dexterity plus one.\nLAURA: It's on my phone now. We switched.","response":"DM: That's okay. “So there is the manual of quickness of action, we also have the hat of disguise –” And she produces this like –"}
{"prompt":"(Facetime noises)","response":"DM: And she produces this like – She produces this fine brass cap that has intricate swirling runes on it and what looks like a small set of ears that are pushed on the sides so when it fits on the head it looks almost like a smaller head on top of yours. She says, “This cap when worn, however, one can alter their appearance however they see fit. We also have –” She pulls out this thick, leather armor that has a brownish-blue trimmed hue to it and goes, “This is what we refer to as coldsnap leather armor. It has an enchantment to improve one's armor class by two. While wearing it, you have resistance to cold damage.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is it leather armor, you said?","response":"DM: “Leather armor, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How much is that?","response":"DM: “That is 7,500 gold pieces. We also have the cape of Mountebank. It is a cape that when triggered –” She takes it and shifts it for a second, you can see a little bit of smoke plumes off of it, smells sulfurish. She goes, “While wearing it, you can use it to teleport yourself a short distance instantaneously, once per day. We have this –” She pulls another dark cloak off the wall. This one looks like it's made of dark fur, but as she shakes it you can see these two little tendrils are on it. They like wiggle about, these little spiked edges to the tendrils. “This is a cloak of displacement, enchanted and taken from the body of a displacer beast. While wearing it, it makes it so your body projects an illusion. Anyone attempting to cause you harm has difficulty actually finding purchase on your physical form, not knowing where you truly stand.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I will take that cape.","response":"DM: “It is 4,500 gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wonderful. Vex? Oh, shit. She's not here.\nMARISHA: A third-level spell?","response":"DM: “Yes, up to third level, one spell slot, you can immediately restore it. It does require attunement, however, and you can't have more than three items attuned to you, so be aware of your limitations.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What's the price on that one?","response":"DM: “This is 550 gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.\nORION: Pike, do you have any 3rd-level healing spells?\nASHLEY: Do I have 3rd-level healing spells? I do.\nLIAM: Everyone hears from the back, Scanlan's voice piping up saying, “Just buy all this shit!”\nMARISHA: Just buy all this shit.\nASHLEY: Buy everything.\nMARISHA: How much money did we have? Didn't we have like at least –\nLIAM: Thirty… thirty-ish. I mean, I'm not here, but –","response":"DM: And you still have money you haven't collected in Kraghammer, too."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Huh?","response":"DM: There's money you still haven't collected in Kraghammer. Lord Nostoc Greyspine, you guys made a deal with him before you went down in the pits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So maybe we could open up a line – I'm sure you guys could open up a line of credit with my buddy Gilmore.\nMARISHA: A line of credit?\nLIAM: Yeah, an I.O.U. Once we're back from our day.\nMARISHA: So we've got like roughly 30k?\nLIAM: In our possession now. Thirty-one.\nORION: We have over that. Because Vex and Grog are with us. And they have –","response":"DM: She has all the money. So we'll just keep track of what you guys spend and bring it back to Vex, your treasurer. And she'll be really angry that you guys spent all that money."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She's trying, she's trying, it's coming up on my phone.\nORION: The trick is, we don't know how much the total is.\nMARISHA: We generally would if our party's here. She just can't tell us at this moment.\nORION: It's well over thirty. I think we have closer to fifty. … maybe forty.","response":"DM: So she presents this dagger to you guys –"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We don't want to deplete all of our funds.","response":"DM: So she presents this dagger to you guys – “This is a fine dagger,"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We don't want to deplete all of our funds.","response":"DM: \"This is a fine dagger, the blood runs themselves are enchanted –”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We also spent a lot on the keep, don't forget that, we dumped a lot of money into the keep.","response":"DM: Yep, you did."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So we might have more like thirty.\nASHLEY: What's this dagger?","response":"DM: “This dagger actually can take the lifeforce from an enemy when delivering a very strong blow.” Essentially, on a critical hit on the attack roll –"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: We got it.\nORION: Here they are.\nMARISHA: How much money do we have?\nLAURA: We have –hold on, let me look.\nTRAVIS: Twenty-four thousand –\nORION: So we have 50,000 total. Because we just had 30, we just got paid 30 grand, right?","response":"DM: Yeah, ten."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No.\nMARISHA: Ten grand.","response":"DM: You got ten grand from Allura and you currently have a floating –"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And she added that.\nORION: That's added?\nLAURA: I already added that, we're at 20,000.\nORION: I thought we were at 30 –\nMARISHA: We spent almost 50,000 dollars on our keep.\nORION: Right, but –\nTRAVIS: Plus those fucks in Kraghammer owe us a fortune.\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Yeah, 25,000 gold is still owed by Lord Nostoc Greyspine."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's who owed us.\nMARISHA: Yes, that's what we're saying.\nORION: What?\nMARISHA: That's why we're saying we only have 20 or 30 –\nTALIESIN: No, we haven't gone back there.\nORION: So we'll have to go back and get it.\nTALIESIN: Eventually, yeah.","response":"DM: “So while you –”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Will you point us a little bit out so we can see –","response":"DM: “As I was saying, this dagger, upon a very impactful wound on a foe, steals a bit of its life force, dealing an additional ten necrotic damage, and then gives the wielder ten temporary hitpoints.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Whoa, that's major.","response":"DM: “So there's that. We also have an enchanted heavy maul, and we have –this is quite a find here.” As she pulls out this wooden case, she pulls back the wooden top to it. As she does, you can see there's a little bit of ice crystal that's gathered along the interior of the wooden case. There inside sits a short sword, a relatively thick short blade, but the blade itself is like a blue, almost glimmering metal, and there's actually a rising frozen mist that drifts off the blade. “This is an enchanted frostbrand. It acts as a shortsword. Whenever it does damage to an enemy, it does an additional 1d6 cold damage. And while you hold the weapon you have resistance to any fire damage you would take. At freezing temperatures, it sheds a ten foot radius of dim light, and when you draw the weapon, you extinguish all magical flames within 30 feet of you.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Fancy.","response":"DM: “And those are currently all the things we have at the moment. We're working on a few more things that will be ready in the next couple of weeks, but those are the current haul for our above-the-average consumer. Magical creations.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I have a question.","response":"DM: “Yes.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Do you have anything that can make armor… quieter?\nASHLEY: Maybe like a really heavy armor, that's really quiet.\nLIAM: That oil from the Wizard of Oz.","response":"DM: “We don't have anything for that, but we could have it commissioned for you if you'd like.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I would like to see about that.\nASHLEY: That would be great.\nASHLEY: Thank you.\nORION: I will take the enchanted mithral shirt and the cape, thank you very much.\nORION: But that's not the total yet. Vex has to talk about the rest of what we want.\nASHLEY: What's the price on the dagger and the sword?","response":"DM: “The sword is 8,500 gold pieces. The dagger is 7,800 gold pieces. This is without your discount. The mithral chain shirt, it is medium armor, I lied. It is 5,250 gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wait, I can't –","response":"DM: You can't wear armor. “And you were looking at the pearl of power, which is 550 gold, and there is the cloak of displacement, which is 4,500 gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Would you be interested in a trade?","response":"DM: “What do you have to trade?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We've got lots of bits from dragons, lots of bits from umber hulks, and we've got basilisk eggs.\nMARISHA: We also have that diamond and the ruby. Do we know how much that is?\nORION: Yes. Do we know how much that is?\nLAURA: We also have some jewels.\nMARISHA: I definitely say we pick up that ring with the AC and I wouldn't mind having that leather –\nLAURA: The ring of protection?\nMARISHA: That ring of protection that gives you plus two to your AC. That we need for somebody. And I wouldn't mind having that leather armor. That adds a plus two to my AC.","response":"DM: “Cold snap?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yup.\nMARISHA: We should get that too.","response":"DM: “–cold snap leather armor –”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Get that manual.","response":"DM: “–cloak of displacement, ring of protection plus two –”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Put the dagger and sword on the table also. Just in case.\nASHLEY: Throwing it out there to see, I don't know.","response":"DM: “They are there on the table.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We have nowhere near enough for all of this.\nORION: Let's see what the total is.\nMARISHA: We could trade,\nORION: Let's see what the total is.\nMARISHA: Let's see what we can trade around maybe.","response":"DM: “So the total for all of these items, including –” She starts going through her –"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I want new stuff. I haven't gotten new armor since we started.\nTALIESIN: I haven't either.\nORION: You should get the mithral shirt, it adds something to your –\nMARISHA: Do you wear light armor or medium armor?\nTALIESIN: I would guess light armor, I imagine.","response":"DM: “With the discount, this entire haul would come to 49,815 gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What's that, how much?\nMARISHA: 50k.","response":"DM: “49,815 gold pieces with your discount for this entire sum. Now, would you like to pay in gold? Would you like to pay in–”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Get the dragon armor out.\nORION: Twenty-four total, before the dwarven–\nASHLEY: Maybe we can see how much we can trade of what we have, maybe we can get a little–\nLAURA: How much is a pound of dragon scales worth to you?","response":"DM: “What dragon? Show me the scales.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Blue dragon scales.\nTRAVIS: Blue dragon scales, here you go.","response":"DM: You pull them out of the bag of holding. She takes a few and she takes her glasses off and then pulls out from a pocket this intricate-looking, multi-lensed tinkering viewing device and inspects it very closely."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It was a very powerful dragon.","response":"DM: “Apparently not powerful enough if you have these.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hey Pike, don't take this shit.\nMARISHA: I don't know if that was a compliment or an insult.\nTRAVIS: Hey Pike, don't take this shit.","response":"DM: Puts it away in her pocket and goes,"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Taking it as a compliment.","response":"DM: Puts it away in her pocket and goes, “These are legitimate. I won't question how you came about them, but they are definitely legitimate. A pound, you say?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How much is a pound worth to you?\nTRAVIS: We have several pounds.\nLAURA: And I'll tell you how much we have.","response":"DM: “Say a pound of dragon scales –” And the dragon scales themselves are about that big each, they're about the size of a peach."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, shit.","response":"DM: Dragons are big, especially this one. “Blue dragon scales, I'd say a pound is maybe, guessing close to eight to ten scales. That would be worth about, I'd put that at 1,000 gold credit for each pound provided.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I have at least 11 pounds.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nORION: Perfect.\nLAURA: So that's another, at least, what? Eleven thousand?\nLIAM: Five hundred thousand gold right there.\nLAURA: That's like another 10,000 we have in dragon scales.\nTRAVIS: We have 11 pounds of dragon scales.\nMARISHA: And how about that diamond that we put in the mending wheel?\nORION: No, ruby.\nLAURA: It's flawless and beautiful and so sparkly.\nMARISHA: How much?","response":"DM: Pulls that again, looks over it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Catch.","response":"DM: “This ruby, probably about 500 gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's it?\nTRAVIS: We also have three dragon teeth, fangs from the beast's mouth.","response":"DM: Make a perception roll."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh sweet, and they froze there.","response":"DM: Or not that, a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh no, they –\nMARISHA: Oh no, they didn't!\nLIAM: I'm gonna tell them. Oh my gosh.\nMARISHA: Persuasion roll. Oh no!\nLIAM: You have to make a persuasion roll, quick.\nTALIESIN: That's hilarious.","response":"DM: Timing is everything, folks. Timing is everything."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Timing is everything.\nASHLEY: I have one dragon fang around my neck.","response":"DM: That's a keepsake for actually slaying a dragon. You're welcome to trade that. It's worth quite a bit."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No.\nTALIESIN: No.\nASHLEY: That was the white dragon?","response":"DM: That was the white dragon."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, it was the white dragon you killed.","response":"DM: That's the one that you got the final blow on."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What was your persuasion?","response":"DM: That's the one that you got the final blow on."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Not worth the memory of killing a white dragon.\nMARISHA: What was your persuasion?\nTALIESIN: Not worth the memory of killing a white dragon.\nASHLEY: I know, I gotta keep it.","response":"DM: Anyway."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Gotta keep it.\nASHLEY: Keepsake, can't put a price on it.\nLIAM: Ten. Ten, they rolled a ten.","response":"DM: They rolled a ten. She says, “Dragons' teeth actually, strangely enough, are a little easier to find. I would put, each dragon's tooth available would probably add about 250 gold pieces to the exchange.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We've got three.\nMARISHA: And how about the basilisk eggs? While we're –\nLIAM: Get it out out.\nMARISHA: –cleaning our bag out, exactly.\nTRAVIS: We have two basilisk eggs we're willing to part with.","response":"DM: As you pull out the basilisk eggs, you pull it out and immediately there is a stench that is emanating from these eggs that have been in your bag of holding for probably close to eight or nine months."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, the smell means they're good.","response":"DM: This is now the fourth time she's looked at you with a deadpan glance and adjusted her glasses. “We're not interested in the eggs, but thank you anyway.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is super, super powerful.\nTRAVIS: It might've congealed a little bit actually, though.\nASHLEY: No, it's absolutely just really fresh because we put it in Tupperware.","response":"DM: “We'll stick with the scales for now.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You'll stick with the scales.\nTRAVIS: Right, any chance you'd be interested in claws of an umber hulk?\nLIAM: I like that the 400,000 people who saw that thing are tuning in to the shopping episode.\nTALIESIN AND MARISHA: To the shopping episode!\nORION: Hi everybody.\nLIAM: We've been fighting and killing for weeks, and now we're haggling over prices.\nORION: But we do need new gear.","response":"DM: Timing is everything."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We do need new gear.","response":"DM: This has now turned into the flea-market episode. Hey, you guys guide the story. It's fun though."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You guys guide the story.","response":"DM: “We'd say with the credit from the dragon scales, that'll take 10,000, 11,000 away from the current pricing, that would put us at 39,815 for this batch.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So can we open that line of credit we were talking about?","response":"DM: “What line of credit?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That line we're talking about right now.\nORION: Well said, your majesty.\nMARISHA: That one that I just said two seconds ago?\nLIAM: Wait, DM, where am I with Gilmore?","response":"DM: We'll get to that right now."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It takes time to make a –\nLAURA: We could advertise for Gilmore.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nASHLEY: We could advertise, but maybe we should wait until they get back so if their walk goes really well, whatever that means, we could maybe try to strike a deal.\nMARISHA: Right, put this on layaway?\nLAURA: He'll probably give us everything for free.\nASHLEY: Because we probably need to talk to Gilmore about the credit.\nORION: True.\nTALIESIN: Yes, that's fair.\nMARISHA: So can we hold this for now?\nASHLEY: We'll wait until Gilmore gets back.","response":"DM: “Certainly.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: We'll wait until Gilmore gets back.\nMARISHA: Oh, good.","response":"DM: “If you wish.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So you guys. Natural history museum? Pizza and then natural history museum?\nORION: What is pizza?","response":"DM: In the meantime."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It sounds wonderful.\nMARISHA: We've got time, we've gotta wait for their man-date, we can go see some sights.","response":"DM: In the meantime. for their man-date, we can go see some sights."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: In-between time.","response":"DM: Vax."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: In-between time.","response":"DM: Yes. Gilmore, who has sweeped you out into the middle of Abedar's Promenade, takes you by the arm and begins to lead you happily up towards the Erudite Quarter of Emon, which has a secondary wall around it as well. As he brings you along, he talks happily and loudly about how, “It's rather wonderful the way that we were presented with this opportunity over in Westruun. It's magnificent, the team they've assembled to build this brand. I'm very excited at how they brought it to my attention. I wanted to keep things very localized, of course, but it seems–”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Will you trust the folk in Emon to handle your business or will you go between?","response":"DM: “The folk in Westruun?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: “I have a couple of friends there that will oversee the process, but I will be very involved and keeping an eye, so I'm not too terribly worried. Besides, it's a much smaller business we're running there and it'll be fine. Oh, look ahead.\" As you guys step into the Erudite Quarter, he's now brought you into  essentially what is an outdoor botanical garden that is just a very nice walk. Grass across the ground, with fine well-cut bushes. There is a canopy of beautiful trees that are arcane, through arcane means, twisted and sculpted to form this long tunnel. It's strangely romantic. As Gilmore begins to walk you down, there's a fountain to the side, and he says, \"What about you? How's Vox Machina been? How've they been treating you? How are you, Vax?\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, we're tired, to be sure. I was not kidding before, we really are lucky to be alive. And that's thanks in large part to a lot of the gear you outfitted us with the last time.\nLIAM: You were mentioned in Kraghammer. I regret to inform you, though, that we were forced to travel underground rather quickly and the duergar and the other things that we ran into were not really customers you'd want to deal with. No, our lives were too much in harm's way. But now that we're above ground, I'm looking to pick up where I left off.","response":"DM: “Very well.”"}

{"prompt":"LIAM: You're a unique man, Gilmore. No question. Never met anyone quite like you.","response":"DM: “Well. Would you care to share a glass of wine with a man not quite like anyone else you've met?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Indeed. What do you recommend in the area?","response":"DM: “Oh, please, come, there are casks that pour the finest of honeyed Syngoran wine. I know perhaps you've not been home for quite some time?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's a complicated thing for me, one that I'm not really quite ready to talk about yet.","response":"DM: “Oh.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Maybe someday.","response":"DM: “Maybe with enough wine.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You old so-and-so.\nMARISHA: You old so-and-so.\nLIAM: I took the duergar, I was holding her right over the cliff, and I just cut, and she fell! She fell! I didn't know what I was doing, I just did it!","response":"DM: “You are ridiculous, Vax'ildan! Oh, it tickles me.”"}

{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Sounds like you had fun.\nLIAM: Family. Family, family. I've had a couple of drinks. I'm an adult, I can do that. What have you found? Have you guys been shopping?\nMARISHA: Well, we have!\nORION: Yes!\nMARISHA: We were hoping that you and Gilmore had a wonderful time and that, we just thought we'd wait for you. We didn't want to make any final decisions without one of our main party members.\nLIAM: I pat him on the back, I do a little circle with my hand.\nMARISHA: Remember, you have advantage.","response":"DM: “I'm not as spry as I once was, unfortunately. But yes! Business to attend. What do you need? What can we do?” At which point Sherri, waiting in the back, says, “Sir, they've requested perhaps a few things in bulk. The current amount comes to about roughly 40,000 gold, with your discount.” “Forty thousand gold, oh, well. Certainly. What seems to be the problem?”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Well, I don't know. We were just talking about, since we're purchasing so many things, and since we've gained some popularity here in Emon, walking around, people are noticing us walking around… I shouldn't be the one talking right now. Maybe we could open up a line of credit.\nLIAM: Obviously we're only shopping with you, Gilmore, at this point.","response":"DM: He looks about the rest of the group and says, “Not everyone seems to be wearing the same patented Gilmore's Glorious Armor that was given not too long ago. So that's not true.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: We did find some off of dead things.\nLIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: “And those dead things are not under the umbrella of Gilmore's Glorious Expansion.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh.","response":"DM: “But should we discuss this, where would this credit be placed against, what do you have that you could ante?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What have you guys been talking about?

Grog just whispered to me. Yes?\nLAURA: How much is a platinum worth?","response":"DM: “What is a platinum? Platinum is worth ten gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Where we at, girl?\nORION: She is displeased.\nLAURA: We may have a lot more money than I thought we had, because Grog's been hiding money in the bag of holding.\nTRAVIS: It's really shiny. I'm in trouble, Matt. She's really mad.\nMARISHA: Wait, is this like when you slapped Trinket on the ass mad?\nLAURA: No. Not close, not even close. Doesn't mean as much as Trinket means.\nLIAM: This is finances, this sounds like a married couple.\nTALIESIN: How much platinum do we have hiding in the bag of holding?\nTRAVIS: I don't have the number in front of me, but it's at least 150.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: Where did we procure that again, Grog? I'm sorry, I'm a little fershnickered.\nTRAVIS: I don't remember, but it's in the bag of holding.\nLAURA: I remember getting platinum.\nMARISHA: I do remember getting platinum, too.","response":"DM: But you don't have a number."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, I know it's at least 100, at least 150, I think it's somewhere up north of 150, I just can't remember the number.\nLIAM: Did we get that from the dragon, where did we get that?","response":"DM: It was a combination of the dragon, the horde you rage-looted –"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Rage-hoarding. Rage-looting.\nLIAM: I'll never forget the rage-looting.\nASHLEY: Rage-looting.\nLIAM: I'll never forget the rage-looting.\nTRAVIS: It's my shiny, though, I didn't want to give it to her, though. She's evil. You see how she haggles!\nTRAVIS: Well, we could buy a party with all that.\nLIAM: Not that kind of party, Grog.\nLAURA: I think we have enough to buy everything if you guys want.\nLIAM: Grog, money is meant to be spent.\nTRAVIS: I'm going to drink!\nASHLEY: That solves everything.","response":"DM: Scanlan goes, \"I agree. Drinks and whoring.\" And smacks Grog in the side. The two of them leave off into the evening to go ahead and make use of their return to Emon properly."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, we do.","response":"DM: “How much is waiting for you there?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Twenty-five, wasn't it?\nLAURA: It was 25,000.","response":"DM: “How about we open a 25,000 gold piece line of credit here with Gilmore's Glorious Goods that you only need to pay back within the next month.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's fair.","response":"DM: “Giving you time to arrive. If it's not paid, you will be hunted. But I'm sure that won't be a worry, will it?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: How far is Kraghammer from here?\nTALIESIN: Not far.\nLAURA: It's a week's ride, isn't it?\nORION: I can't teleport everyone.\nMARISHA: Gilmore, question. Maybe you should consider making little pins that we could just wear on top of our armor? Because wearing your armor, we have our own clothes that we like, so maybe like a pin.","response":"DM: He steps forward and says, “Oh –”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Or like a patch?","response":"DM: “–that's not even a worry.” He pulls out a small implement, this wand, and he flicks it over your shoulder. And all of a sudden an arcane swirl around your armor, with a big flash of sparks and glitter almost. You look down and there is, emblazoned upon your current armored form, a symbol of Gilmore's Glorious Goods\nnow permanently emblazoned on the leather."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ah!","response":"DM: “Easy enough to fix.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What a good idea.\nMARISHA: I was going to put it on that leather.\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nMARISHA: I was going to put it on that leather. My mom gave this to me.","response":"DM: “Well, your mother has not provided for you the means of keeping the deal we already made.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can you take this off when we pay you back and put it on that one? Oh, come on.\nTALIESIN: I think it'll transfer when you change.\nMARISHA: Will it transfer when I change armor?","response":"DM: “I don't know.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: We'll find out.","response":"DM: “So. Twenty-five thousand gold line of credit, within a month or you'll be hunted.”"}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: What?","response":"DM: “It's a creature of my creation, I designed it when I was a child –”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's a phallic thing.\nMARISHA: Ah.\nLAURA: So we open the 25,000 line of credit with you and you give us all the things we want?","response":"DM: “If that is what you want.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Don't we have a lot of platinum? What are we dickering prices with?\nLAURA: Yes! Why don't we just buy it now, and then we won't have a line of credit with Gilmore?\nTRAVIS: (cries)\nLIAM: Yes, we'll use some of the platinum. One platinum is equal to ten gold. Sorry, Gilmore. Trying to dicker over rates.\nASHLEY: Not a line of credit?\nLIAM: No line of credit, we'll pay for it outright in cold hard platinum.","response":"DM: You don't have the amount of platinum with you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But Grog's got it.","response":"DM: Grog said, because he doesn't have it in front of him, he has around 150 platinum."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We can pay him back, it's true.","response":"DM: That's roughly 1,500 gold."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But where is it?","response":"DM: It's in the bag of holding, but he doesn't have the bag of holding information in front of him."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He doesn't have the info. And because he doesn't have the sheet –\nTALIESIN: –next game.\nLIAM: –and he can't read the exact amount?","response":"DM: Yup. Because he said in memory it's 150 platinum. That's only –"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I thought it was a 100,000.","response":"DM: Oh, no."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No no no, 150 platinum.\nLIAM: Oh, 150.","response":"DM: Hundred thousand you'd be the richest man in the fucking world."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: So 150 platinum –"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What do you think, sis?","response":"DM: –based on memory is 11,500,"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Vox Machina treasurer?","response":"DM: which is a little helpful."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right.\nLIAM: What do you think?\nLAURA: That would put us at about 30,000 that we have to spend left, which the signal cut out so it doesn't matter.","response":"DM: No, we've got you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, we can hear you!\nLIAM: No, we've got you.\nMARISHA: No, we can hear you!\nLAURA: Okay.\nLIAM: So the total tab is what again, Gilmore?\nLAURA: How much do we have? He does have a picture of it. We have 1,620 platinum.\nMARISHA: What!","response":"DM: Is that right? There you go."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So that's like–","response":"DM: 16,000 gold pieces."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So we don't need to open up a line of credit?\nLIAM: No.","response":"DM: Ten gold per platinum."}
{"prompt":"ORION: We have 1,000.","response":"DM: A thousand platinum. One thousand six hundred platinum. Move the decimal point. That brings it to 16,000 gold pieces."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Move two on that.","response":"DM: No, it's not 100 gold per platinum, ten gold per platinum."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, I'm with you.\nORION: I get it.","response":"DM: We're getting into math in this."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Our charity, 826LA, after-school tutoring.\nTALIESIN: It could've made this all go so much better.\nMARISHA: Really good to have,\nTALIESIN: It could've made this all go so much better.\nMARISHA: Your reading and your writing and your arithmetic.\nTALIESIN: For players who can read good.\nMARISHA: For players who can read good.\nLIAM: Ring it up, we'll take it.\nASHLEY: We'll take it all.\nLIAM: The whole lot.\nASHLEY: And then, could I commission you, by the way, to maybe make some armor that's really heavy armor but very quiet?","response":"DM: “How heavy?”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: How heavy can you make it?","response":"DM: “I can work on plate armor if you'd like, but an enchantment of that magnitude would be the only enchantment it would have. So it would be the equivalent of full plate armor and the entire enchantment would enable you to move a little more easily inside it, and that would cost, it would take about, I'd say, a month to enchant on my end and would cost about, not including the cost of the actual armor, materials and time required, I'd put it at about 8,000 gold pieces?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Worth it. We'll fund the money.\nASHLEY: And it'll just be really quiet?","response":"DM: “It will enable you to move freer within the armor.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: By a turn. Is 8,000 Vox Machina's rate, or the general rate?","response":"DM: “That is through our friendship and our current arrangement.”"}

{"prompt":"LIAM: Understood.","response":"DM: “Good.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm not taking advantage.\nTALIESIN: Fair.\nLAURA: That wasn't much of a discount, Gilmore.\nLIAM: Hush up, Vex'ahlia. Done, sold, thank you. With our thanks.","response":"DM: “So minus the platinum, that's 22,000 gold pieces after the platinum and dragon scales.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And we have that, right?","response":"DM: “And you have 25,000 gold credit if you'd like.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We have, hold on… gotta go away for a minute.\nLIAM: We're passing on the credit, Gilmore.\nLAURA: We have plenty left.\nLIAM: Yes.\nLIAM: You guys are a black screen, what happened?\nTALIESIN: They paused it.\nLAURA: I was looking at my calculator.\nORION: Abacus!\nLIAM: You're so dark sometimes, Vex'ahlia. I swear.\nLAURA: So the total was 20,000 minus the platinum and the dragon scales?","response":"DM: “Twenty-two thousand.”"}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: So really though. Will this transfer to that?","response":"DM: “I have no idea.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I was wanting to ask you, Gilmore. Have you considered maybe doing potion-making workshops?","response":"DM: “Hm. I'll put some thought to that.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Let me know.\nLAURA: I feel very uncomfortable and I leave. I go outside to hang out with Trinket.","response":"DM: Okay. As Gilmore takes the change behind the counter, he goes, “I've got a bit more business to do here. Vax, I greatly appreciate spending the afternoon with you. Where are you staying?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I take him by the hand, do one of these clasps, and say, We live here now, we're residents. I haven't had time to tell you. We have a keep, our own keep. You should come visit.

The frostband sword?\nLIAM: No, clerics can't use swords.","response":"DM: Check on your class, you might have access to it. Let me check here for you real fast."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It used to be just blunt weapons for clerics, wasn't it?","response":"DM: That's the older version, they've changed a few things. They don't do it too often. Let me double-check. Cleric has access to all simple weapons. The sword is a martial weapon so you cannot use that as a weapon."}

{"prompt":"SAM: Hi!","response":"DM: They found themselves over the ocean, suddenly attacked by a band of what seemed to be wyvern- and griffin-riding bandits. The battle took place on the top of the skyship, some of the magic being taken out, a few lives lost, but the party managed to persevere, take a captive, and continue on their journey, the Horn of Orcus and its container kept safe. And that's where we pick up and begin."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can you say all of that again for me?\nTRAVIS: You don't listen, anyway.","response":"DM: No."}

Wuss.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She's a mage, right?","response":"DM: That you saved. She is a mage, and she has also been bound, at the orders of the captain, so as not to cause any issues on the ship while she's there. So as to her future, after your conversation with him, as to whether or not she could work on this ship, based on the fact that their first meeting involved her and her band attacking and trying to murder his entire crew, Captain Damon was not too keen on the idea at the time being and decided to lock her up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: So. We shall see her fate in the near future."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: She's locked up.\nLAURA: Okay. She's locked up.\nTRAVIS: She's got tricks, though, right?","response":"DM: She has tricks, but there is an anti-magic brig built into the ship specifically for this purpose."}

I was going to pay you to put the kibosh on her.\nORION: She's negged.\nTRAVIS: Cool.\nORION: You said the next few days without incident? Cool.\nTRAVIS: Could I try to further my beard?\nSAM: Oh, yes! Try to grow a beard.\nMARISHA: Yeah, his beard. Let's go for the beard.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll another percentage dice."}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Three. Eight.","response":"DM: 38. The little bit of peach-fuzz stubble on the chin of your goliath face begins to slowly grow. It's coming out colorless. It's almost translucent with a hint of gray and white."}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.\nSAM: Ugh.\nASHLEY: Whoa.\nTRAVIS: Don't be jealous.\nASHLEY: Grog, it's sparkling. It's sparkling!\nLAURA: It's really creepy, Grog.\nASHLEY: Hey, I feel it. It's like sandpaper, a little bit.\nTRAVIS: Thank you. Thank you.","response":"DM: Keep in mind, goliaths, predominantly– especially pureblood goliaths– do not grow facial hair. The fact that this magical feat is even achieving any modicum of growth is in itself an arcane marvel, and who knows what detrimental effects this may have in the long run, going against your physiology."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I have some beads. If you want, we can braid it and put beads in there.\nLAURA: Ooh.\nTRAVIS: I'm all about it. Beads and bells and shit?\nMARISHA: Okay!\nMARISHA: I braid Grog's beard.\nTRAVIS: Give me a staff and I'll be Gandalf.\nMARISHA: And put beads in it. And a few flowers, as well.\nTRAVIS: Wait! Ooh, weird.\nMARISHA: It looks nice.","response":"DM: It takes you a lot of concentration to try and get any sort of braidage through the about an inch to inch and a half facial hair that is growing from his chin."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Looks good!\nTRAVIS: It's really tight when you braid it like that. It pinches.\nMARISHA: You'll get used to it.\nLAURA: Maybe you can cast Grasping Vine on his chin and grow it out.","response":"DM: What could possibly go wrong?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do it. Could be great.\nORION: I suggest against this.\nTRAVIS: I thought you suggest violence.\nORION: No.\nSAM: He encourages violence.\nLAURA: I encourage violence.\nORION: I'm against this.\nASHLEY: Is it just violence?\nLAURA: So we're healed. We're healed, right?\nSAM: Oh, days have gone by, right?","response":"DM: Yeah, you guys have rested. Days have gone by, your spells have returned to you–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hey, DM, days have gone by?\nLAURA: Trinket's feeling good.","response":"DM: Days have gone by at this time. You've continued traveling over the Ozmit Sea."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Are we nearing the destination?","response":"DM: I'll get to that in just a second. Do you have a question, Liam?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, not a question, but last night while Grog was sleeping– I can see right up Grog's nose. While Grog was sleeping, I went and got a bit of rope from the ship and used my disguise kit that I have. I sort of frayed a part of the rope and spent about an hour using spirit gum to glue bits of frayed rope to Grog's chin into a small Gilmore-esque goatee. And he didn't seem to wake up, and I'd like to see how that worked out.\nTRAVIS: I'm gonna do a sleep check or something, right? I can't let him survive that.","response":"DM: For this, go ahead and make a perception check with disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: With disadvantage?!\nSAM: Because you're asleep!\nTRAVIS: One.\nORION: Get it out now.","response":"DM: You wake up the following morning and immediately run to the nearest reflective surface to check on yourself, and you have a glorious, dark brown, well-braided, mildly frayed, thick, coarse goatee braid. It goes about a good three to four inches from the bottom of your chin. And you are very proud."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I knew it! I knew it! I am a special boy.\nTRAVIS: Only this one strand is this color and everything else is white and translucent, whatever–\nORION: I think it looks good on you, Grog.\nTRAVIS: Thank you! I wave my head and it whips around.\nASHLEY: (sings) I whip my beard back and forth.\nTRAVIS: (sings) I whip my beard back and forth.\nMARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if this seems to be natural or arcane?","response":"DM: Certainly."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Nice.\nLAURA: (sings) With her big fancy die!\nMARISHA: Okay, that's a 10 plus– 20, total.\nORION: I'm going to sense the weather, I suppose, because this doesn't look fun.","response":"DM: Okay. The weather is cold."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ooh, it's cold.\nTRAVIS: So the weather outside is frightful?\nLAURA: Good call, Tiberius. Good call. I agree, it is rather cold.\nORION: I don't like this. Scanlan.\nSAM: Oi?\nORION: Like we were discussing earlier, would you be interested in the still-standing trade of my Ioun Stone for your circlet-crown thingy?\nSAM: Oh, you know what, Tiberius, I have been giving this a lot of thought and consideration. What's for lunch?\nORION: What would you like for lunch? I already ate.\nSAM: Oh. No. No, I was done with the conversation.\nTRAVIS: Oh, good diss.\nLAURA AND ASHLEY: Oh.\nORION: Well. Keyleth, if you could put a little slate up for me, I'd like to illustrate something for little Scanlan. And perhaps his tiny mind can comprehend it. (clears throat)\nLAURA: Ooh!\nASHLEY: Hey, that's rude.\nORION: Would you, perhaps, do this?\nLAURA: His tiny mind is exactly proportionate for the rest of his body, Tiberius.\nSAM: Well, not the entire body.\nORION: I'm going to walk up to the hull and be like–\nMARISHA: No! Write it right here! I throw up a slate.\nORION: Oh. (clears throat)","response":"DM: Okay. It's the strangest wall you've constructed, as up in the air on the ship that is mostly constructed out of iron and metal, there is little to no stone available of which you can sprout a Wall of Stone. However, there are weights set up on top, so what you create is less of a smooth Wall of Stone and more of a very thin, brittle shale wall that may function for the time being, but probably won't stand up for more than five to ten minutes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I see. Prestidigitation. Some chalk.\nORION: You see, Scanlan, you've had this particular piece for over ten, let's say, matches or weeks. You have used it zero times. In over six battles, over the same course, using it zero times.\nORION: I, being a sorcerer, have a special ability called sorcerer points, where I can do multiple spells in a single round.\nSAM: Yes.\nORION: Which none of you can do. Other than monks, of course.\nLAURA: That's true. Brag about it, Tiberius. Just keep bragging about it.\nORION: When I can do multiple spells, like two, versus you, who can do one, that means that I can do one more spell than you can per round.\nORION: And every round after that. One hundred percent.\nSAM: This is amazing.\nORION: Your utilization of the actual item has been equivalent to nothing. In the interest of the group and the use of items in general, it would be wise to switch it, because you have needed extra spells like Invisibility–","response":"DM: The shale wall cracks."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Several times.\nMARISHA: I'm sorry.\nORION: Where my item would be more useful in general to you.\nLIAM: May I ask, is magical ability inversely proportionate to wisdom?\nORION: Oh, me?\nSAM: Who are you asking?\nASHLEY: Is magical ability inversely proportionate to wisdom?\nORION: Absolutely not. I am one of the strongest casters in all of Draconia, and it only takes the strength of my charisma to do my stuff.\nLAURA: Oh. Everything makes sense now, Tiberius.\nTRAVIS: So are you saying you want what he has back?\nTRAVIS: It is I, Brad Pitt from Legends of the Fall.\nTRAVIS: My beard of glory.\nORION: That is a movie.\nTRAVIS: It's an old bard's tale.\nORION: So, Scanlan. What say you?\nSAM: Your mathematical skills have been quite impressive.\nORION: I don't like to show them off.\nSAM: No, no. For a man of such low wisdom, you are proving wiser than I ever imagined.\nSAM: I will gladly make this trade with you. You have convinced me.\nLAURA: Hey.\nMARISHA: Aww.\nORION: Oh, wonderful. Thank you.\nSAM: Yes. Yes.\nASHLEY: Hey.\nLAURA: That's wonderful.\nORION: (explosion sound)\nSAM: Now, what does this thing do?\nORION: Now you can store up to three level spells. Three of them in there.\nLAURA: Oh, it's better than the Pearl of Power!\nORION: And you don't have to expend spell slots to do the spells.\nASHLEY: Hey.\nLAURA: That's a good trade.\nTRAVIS: Oh my god, that was so good.\nASHLEY: That was amazing.\nORION: You can put three Lightning Bolts in there and it costs nothing.\nASHLEY: Oh, math!\nTRAVIS: That was so good.\nASHLEY: That was awesome.\nTRAVIS: I don't know what you wrote, but it looked good.\nMARISHA: Oh, man.\nORION: I'm sorry.","response":"DM: The Ioun Stone which you had taken, you place by your head and release.

You know, religion is up to interpretation, so I interpret it that way.\nASHLEY: It is very cool-looking.\nSAM: Thank you, Pike.\nSAM: Sarenrae's my wingman.\nASHLEY: We cool, Sarenrae.\nTRAVIS: I can't breathe.\nMARISHA: (gasps) It's snowing.\nLAURA: It's snow, Keyleth.\nSAM: (sings) I'm dreaming of a white whatever-we-celebrate.\nTRAVIS: Festivus!\nORION: Festivus.\nMARISHA: There was something I should probably tell you. In this area of land, in Vasselheim, on this continent, somewhere, I'm not sure where, resides the Fire Ashari. Somewhere in the town of Pyrah.\nLAURA: What's that?\nASHLEY: Ooh.\nLAURA: What are Fire Ashari?\nMARISHA: Well, they're my sister tribe. They're a part of my sister tribe. I come from the Air Ashari.\nLAURA: Right.\nTRAVIS: Uh-huh.\nMARISHA: Yeah, from Zephrah.\nASHLEY: (whispers) Fire Ashari?\nLAURA: So they– oh.\nMARISHA: Yeah, so there are Fire Ashari. So the point behind the Ashari– I'm not sure I have expressed this to you all in the past few months. The point of our tribe is we sought out the weakest points where the elemental planes start to bleed with our plane of existence, and these  planes need to be protected, so our people have sought them all out in order to make haven there and be the protectors that we were all born to be. And as part of my Aramente, I have to seek out each of the headmasters and prove myself a worthy leader.\nTRAVIS: Ooh.\nMARISHA: Which makes me really nervous.\nLAURA: We've got your back, Keyleth.\nASHLEY: Oh, you'll do it. You'll totally do it.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, we can burn shit for days.\nMARISHA: So I just thought, you know, maybe after we handle the Horn, maybe we can pop in. You know, since we're here.\nLAURA: Totally. You know, if you want to, Keyleth, when we go, we'll all follow your orders and make it seem like you're an extraordinary leader of us.\nTRAVIS: Ooh, yeah.\nMARISHA: Oh. That could be good. Oh, that sounds fun!\nORION: Oh. Good idea, yes. Of course, I will be your mage guard.\nTRAVIS: Do they make you burn things as a display of your abilities?\nMARISHA: Well, they kind of teach me new things.\nLAURA: Ooh!\nMARISHA: They kind of instill me with their knowledge.\nLAURA: So the tornado thing. You could be like a fire tornado?\nMARISHA: I could. I know!\nTRAVIS: Shut up!\nMARISHA: I'm so excited! But yes. Super nervous, because social skills aren't my strongest suit.\nLAURA: We've noticed.\nTRAVIS: You're a natural. You're great.\nLAURA: You're great, though.\nMARISHA: Oh, you guys.\nASHLEY: But it's very charming.\nTRAVIS: We gotta go there. It's fire everywhere!\nMARISHA: Yes. Yes.\nLIAM: Is everything copacetic between the different tribes?\nTRAVIS: Oh, good question.\nMARISHA: What? What?\nTRAVIS: Is it copacetic?\nLAURA: Are you guys friendly with each other?\nLIAM: Are they happy?\nORION: The tribes.\nMARISHA: Well, yes. Yeah, no, we're all happy. I mean, that's kind of the thing, where once a generation someone sets out and goes on the Aramente in order to come back a headmaster, and it's kind of like our once-a-generation check-in, if you will, to make sure everything's okay.\nTRAVIS: Exchange students.\nMARISHA: Unfortunately, the last person to go on the Aramente didn't come back, which happens sometimes. Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Like, didn't come back ever?\nMARISHA: No.\nLAURA: So, like, you could die?\nORION: Or maybe they got lost to the winds of the road.\nTRAVIS: Right, yeah.\nMARISHA: It was actually my mother.\nORION: Oh, goodness.\nLAURA: (gasps) What?\nTRAVIS: To which tribe?\nMARISHA: I– we don't know. She left when I was a little girl, so I don't remember much. So I don't know if she's alive or dead, really, but–\nLAURA: Keyleth.\nTRAVIS: We did not know that.\nMARISHA: It's okay. It's okay.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, no bigs, right?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Just your mother.\nMARISHA: I mean, it's– I mean. Well. It's fine. It's just. It's weird. I haven't seen her, so I don't know.\nSAM: Awkward.\nMARISHA: I barely remember her.\nTRAVIS: Do you think there's a chance of when we visit this place, we might have to defend ourselves?\nMARISHA: No. No. I wouldn't think so.\nORION: Which means “of course.”\nLAURA: It's not like your family, Grog. They're actually nice.\nMARISHA: Yeah, we're pretty– we're cool.\nTRAVIS: Look, my family is nice, too. We just share love with fists.\nORION: Understandable.\nLAURA: That sounds wrong in so many ways.\nTRAVIS: It does, actually.\nLIAM: Keyleth, did your mother have to go alone, or does your tribe permit there to be help for you?\nMARISHA: I'm assuming it would be okay. We're pretty welcoming.\nLAURA: That's good.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we should totally be there.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: And maybe ask them if they've seen your mom.\nMARISHA: Yeah. That'd be interesting.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: It's weird. There's this part of me in the back of my head that kind of always wonders if I'm going to run into her.\nTRAVIS: How old– when was the last time you saw your mother, or do you even remember?\nMARISHA: I was five, six maybe, years old when she left.\nTRAVIS: Wow.\nMARISHA: So I'm the next in line.\nLAURA: (whispers) Wow.\nSAM: This is heavy.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nASHLEY: This is very heavy.\nMARISHA: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring the mood down.\nSAM: No, it's fine. It's good to know this.\nMARISHA: I'm just letting you know that we're going to be in that neck of the woods, so I should probably–\nLAURA: Stop by.\nASHLEY: Yes.\nMARISHA: – you know, go.\nTRAVIS: Absolutely.\nLAURA: Give a little hello.","response":"DM: “Land sighted!” A voice breaks out from the side of the ship's bow."}

Through the mists, the low clouds of this area, you can make out what looks to be a fairly heavily wooded and overgrown landscape. You can see dark forest peppered with a little bit of snowfall across the top."}

Why can't people be normal?\nTRAVIS: She's warming up to me, I can feel it.","response":"DM: As the ship slowly begins to descend, you can see, in the distance, from one of the various mountain ranges that break past the top, there is one singular mountain spire that tends to protrude from the center of the forest, about 20 to 30 miles off the shoreline of the Ozmit Sea. Around the base of this mountain, you can see, the closer you get to it, what looks like hundreds upon hundreds of stone buildings. You can see little details along the mountainside. Countless staircases are spiraling up this mountain in different directions in a chaotic fashion. There are large structures, fortresses, built into the side of this mountain spire as you progress up the top. And this city proper, which spreads out, I'd say, about a third larger than Emon. Layers of walls and walls and walls. This is probably the most-fortified city you've seen in your existence up to this point. Slowly it begins to bring itself down towards– and you can see, as you get closer to the city, the walls vary in color and material. Some look recently built. Some look like they'd been constructed in the past 50 to 60 years or so from fine, smooth stone, using modern architectural techniques. Some walls look extremely ancient, partially crumbled and having to be refortified. You also notice the top of these walls are completely covered with what looks like these strange dragon-headed ballistae. These defense ballistae that are along every single row of walls. This is a city that is meant to withstand–"}

Not wearing much.\nLAURA: I have a lot of winter cloaks already in my–\nSAM: We have some fancy cloaks, too, don't we?\nLAURA: Well, those are fancy clothes.\nSAM: Oh.\nLAURA: But I've got winter coats that I bought for the group a long time ago.","response":"DM: So she pulls out the really nice, thick–"}

We went shopping.\nLAURA: Remember?\nMARISHA: I remember.\nASHLEY: Oh, we went shopping.\nTRAVIS: We have three other fancy robes.\nASHLEY: We had a girl shop day.\nMARISHA: Yep.\nSAM: A fancy.

You still used the spell slot, but after you rest, it'll be safe inside there. Which is an interesting experience, you see him do this arcane finger wiggle in the air, and then he releases what is a burst of electrical energy that immediately funnels itself and vanishes into the stone, which is now humming with this low pulsing glow of greenish-blue light."}

You feel a little bit of a lurching sensation as the ship suddenly halts its advancing. All the ropes get dropped off the sides. They start bringing what looks to be some sort of a haphazard crane also, in preparation for Trinket to be lowered off the ship. You can see, there's a look of– I can't describe it better than anxiousness to Kima. She says, “If you have any questions about the city, just speak up and I'll do my best.”"}

{"prompt":"LIAM: Why does she seem anxious? Does she seem different? Does her demeanor seem different, or does she just seem in a hurry?","response":"DM: You can probably take it as a little bit of being in a hurry, but you also get the feeling like– there's a nervousness to her that stems– it's hard to really tell where it comes from, but there is a nervousness to her."}

You see there's a cluster of well-armored men and women, wearing semi-matching gray tabards over patchwork and plated armor. They look like a really rough-and-tumble militia, but they all stand firm and as you guys walk up, they give a nod of respect and understanding. Amongst them, you see one gentleman, an elderly gentleman with no hair, completely bald, thick spectacles on the tip of his nose, wearing the same silver and blue robes as the envoys that met you at the Council of Tal'Dorei, the ones that are carrying the box. As you all approach, Kima steps out ahead and says, “Yonn. It's been a while.”"}

Please. These are our escorts. Follow suit. We will bring you onward to the Platinum Sanctuary proper to dispose of this thing.”"}

{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What did you get, Liam?\nLIAM: 13.\nASHLEY: Okay. I got 15.","response":"DM: Okay. He seems stuffy. He seems definitely dedicated to whatever his intent is, but there doesn't seem to be anything deceptive in his speech."}

Until we get to the temple?\nLAURA: Well, nobody knows what it is.\nORION: Right.\nSAM: Well, unless someone–\nLAURA: So we'll just be aware there's a huge envoy.\nMARISHA: I mean, we can only assume– Yonn?","response":"DM: “Yes?”"}

But the city is also currently the oldest known bastion of civilization in the world. As far as it's understood, most human civilization, and a lot of humans believe pre-elf and pre-dwarf, although the dwarves and elves very staunchly disagree, all stemmed from this city, which is believed to be tens of thousands of years old. They have uncovered the single oldest temples to the main deities of good and neutrality within this city, and as such it is considered the holiest place in the modern world, which is why it has been through many, many wars and has seen much warfare and strife and difficulty. And those that live here live here because they feel that they can fight against this, and they actually call it a  privilege to exist in this harsh landscape as devotion to their respective deities. Also, because it is such a holy place, this is why the arcane is considered, for the most part, profane in public and very carefully controlled otherwise."}

You can see a lot of the wood has a kind of mossy texture to it just from the general overgrowth that tends to take the city. It's not kept for beauty, it's kept for function. There's scars across most of the buildings where you can see warfare has bled into the city, and there are markings and various points of ancient damage and certain structures that have not been rebuilt, that have just been left in ruin where they stand, because they have not yet found somebody or a purpose to be restructured. It's a very different landscape than what you're used to, and the walk itself is a very solemn, quiet walk through the city. The folks that do take notice just kind of give a nod of acknowledgement or a gruff grunt as they pass by. There doesn't seem to be a definite interest in your travel, this isn't a special occasion. It seems like travelers and strange occurrences are not that unnatural in this city."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. So it's like New York.","response":"DM: You could say that, yeah. It's a very ancient New York."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And we're carrying a large ark, or a box of some sort?","response":"DM: You are carrying the platinum box that the Horn was kept in."}
{"prompt":"SAM: How big is it?","response":"DM: It's approximately like a foot and a half, or two feet by two feet."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh, Taliesin's here.\nLAURA: Oh!\nTRAVIS: Taliesin's outside.\nSAM: And it's platinum? It's just a platinum box?","response":"DM: Yes, it is made of like solid platinum and silver with a series of very, very intricate scrolling and engravings on it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is it sticking out like a sore thumb?\nLAURA: There were some sapphires in there, too, some blue sapphires, I remember.","response":"DM: Yes, yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is it sticking out like a sore thumb?","response":"DM: Best you can tell, there are people taking notice of it, but none that like stop and gawk, they just kind of, “huh.” Keep walking."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Damn, maybe we should've thrown a blanket or something over it.","response":"DM: You could if you want to, now."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can we, though?\nMARISHA: Burlap sack or something? Anybody?","response":"DM: The guards still flanking you guys, surrounding this ensemble as it presses towards the base of the mountain. You make your way towards the edge of the mountain, or where the mountain begins at the bottom of the floor, and you can see dozens of staircases ascending the outskirts of this giant pointed cragless spire that just sticks up into, actually, the clouds cut off the top of it. It's reminiscent of Gatshadow, the mountain outside of Westruun that you guys traveled to long ago."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right.","response":"DM: But even larger. You continue up this staircase, and the stonework itself is a little lopsided and awkward, and with each step sometimes you have to kinda catch yourself, especially as the wind begins to pick up the higher up the mountain you go, and it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to ascend this staircase. Your legs begin to grow a little sore, until eventually you reach the base of what you can only imagine is the Platinum Sanctuary. You see before you, built into the side of the rock of this mountain, a grand stone fortress that looks older than time in itself. You can see the elements have weathered to the point where even the solid points and how the stonework was meant to be an edge has been rounded and smoothed down. There are a series of silver markings across the outskirts of it, which Tiberius, you recognize as Draconic."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Look, Percy, it's Draconic.\nTALIESIN: Oh, so it is.","response":"DM: Certain words in Draconic–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Percy, you've been so quiet here lately.\nTALIESIN: I don't want to talk about it.","response":"DM: You see phrases emblazoned on the side of this giant temple that say things like “honor, justice.” Various, very old base Draconic stuff. The current language is a more refined version. This is a very, very ancient basis of that language."}
{"prompt":"ORION: See that, Scanlan? That says something like Apollo Justice something.\nSAM: It's Phoenix something.\nORION: It's maybe the rise of the justice of the phoenix.\nSAM: Nah, I don't know.\nORION: It's a lot of things.\nTRAVIS: Dawn of justice–","response":"DM: On the top of this fortress, you see three constructs that don't match the stone structure. These may have been constructed or built many years later and have been added onto the temple. But three ivory and silver spires, towers that ascend from the top of the fortress itself, almost parallel to the very steep mountainside that this fortress is built into. You come to the front doors of this structure. Two very, very large gray stone doors with almost what looks like white marbling through them, and you can see, mostly worn away but still barely visible, the symbol of a shield with a dragon head emblazoned on the front of it, the symbol of Bahamut. As the Scalebearer– yes, that there– as the Scalebearers approach the front, the doors, on their own, and open to the interior, the grinding sound of stone across the marble flooring of the fortress proper. You can see the interior. Did you have a question?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I see inside the temple? Or are the temples pretty enclosed?","response":"DM: You can see now as the doors begin to open."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well, I was an eagle flying overhead.","response":"DM: Oh, yes! You–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I was gonna do a perception check to see if I noticed, like kinda do a loop of the temple.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So, I'm an eagle.\nMARISHA: So I'm an eagle right now, so.\nTALIESIN: You're such an eagle. Oh my god.\nLAURA: I very, very poorly fall off of the roof and clamber down.\nMARISHA: 20 total.","response":"DM: Best you can tell, there are for the makeshift guards in the city– which, you've heard them referred to as Bastions, they're all volunteers, and actually from what you gather here, probably a quarter of the populace are Bastions. So they have a very, very heavy civilian-based militia that guards this city."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are those the guys who were with us, the envoys?","response":"DM: Yes. No, no, not the envoys, the envoys' come from the temple of Bahamut, they have the blue and silver robes. You see, they're just wearing makeshift patchwork armor, whatever that could be scavenged or constructed to outfit a militia, essentially."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.","response":"DM: You see them going up and down every which staircase, just doing various passes and patrolwork. Some of them have spyglasses and you see them looking off in the distance, and as you're getting higher up the mountain, too, you look out about, and you can see the entire forest around you. Very thick, ominous, and you swear every now and then you can see some trees move suddenly and heavily before coming to rest in the distance."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm gonna go check that out first.","response":"DM: The rest of you are entering the temple. Keyleth is not there."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is it lit in there?","response":"DM: The doors close behind you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hope Keyleth is okay.\nLAURA: Keyleth–\nMARISHA: (eagle noises)\nLIAM: I don't think that I was with the group, I think I was back with the crowd–\nLAURA: No, you–\nSAM: Great.\nLIAM: – so I see the eagle fly off and I'm just gonna follow after her.\nLAURA: What?","response":"DM: The eagle flies out of the city."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.\nLAURA: You're gonna leave the city, brother?\nLIAM: No.\nORION: You're leaving?\nMARISHA: Gonna see if I can figure out what's making the trees move.\nLIAM: Now that I understand the–\nLAURA: Come on in the temple.\nLIAM: But do I still get shut in my face? So.\nMARISHA: I'm flying! I'm fine.\nLIAM: It's a big solid building, doors are shut, that's it?","response":"DM: Yeah, I mean, the temple, would you like to enter the temple with the rest of the group?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, you would.\nASHLEY: Yeah, do it.\nLIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: So just as the doors are closing, you rush out of your subtle following pattern and, wait, and put your hands up and manage to make your way into the temple right before the doors close, catching up with the rest of the group. Keyleth, make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I have advantage because I'm an eagle. Ooh, natural 20!\nSAM and TRAVIS: Nice!\nTALIESIN: On the shiny die.\nORION: It is on the shiny die.","response":"DM: It's hard to see much of anything because the canopy of this forest is so dense and so thick, and the snowfall itself, which is getting stronger through the air, and is kind of obscuring some of your vision, but you glance down and you see another set of trees shift suddenly about a quarter-mile away from the city's walls. And you can see on the edge of the city wall a number of guards are beginning to swarm up to the ballista and starting to load them and prepare them. You glance down, and all you see are something fast-moving beneath the canopy, something large. Something you can swear you see it looks serpentine-like. But multiple serpentine-like bodies or forms. And then it's gone in a second."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hydra! You think it's a hydra?\nORION: I don't want it to be a hydra.\nLIAM: Stop gasping, I don't see shit, Laura.\nORION: Oh, that's right.\nLAURA: Shut up!","response":"DM: You see a couple ballista set loose. The bolts go flying through the air, entering the forest. You can hear a loud screeching sound, and a few dozen forests now begin to shake to the side as the creature makes its way away from the city before going still in the distance."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: You get the sensation that this is a–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: A common occurrence.","response":"DM: – a common occurrence."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Good to know. I'm going to loop back around. Is there like an open window in the temple that I can just fly through–\nORION: Ooh. Is there a super clear one that she could try to go through first?\nMARISHA: Be like that Windex commercial, back in the day.","response":"DM: The temple–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: (crashing sounds) Dammit!","response":"DM: You make your way–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I break my neck, I die.\nORION: No.","response":"DM: There are small– they are not windows, more than they are slits for arrow defense."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right.","response":"DM: You as Keyleth could squeeze through. It would be one of those things where you have to careen in, transform, and then squeeze through."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I'll do that.","response":"DM: Which you do, and as you do, you come right into the face of a spear right there–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) You should have transformed into a fly.","response":"DM: – as another one of the Platinum Dragon guards says, “Who goes there?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh boy.\nMARISHA: Hi. Hi.","response":"DM: Another guard begins to approach from the side."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I am with Vox Machina. I'm pretty sure they just came through the front door. It's cool. I was just doing– just like aerial support. I'm just going to go and reconnect with my group. It's fine.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm Keyleth.\nTRAVIS: (whispers) Mention the Scalebearer.\nMARISHA: I'm not good at this shit.","response":"DM: You're not there, Grog."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What am I doing? A persuasion check?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Christ.\nORION: You're going to roll a one.","response":"DM: Sorry, Miss Charisma."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Shut up.\nTALIESIN: Oh, wow.\nMARISHA: Oh, wait. I don't know why I'm rolling two.\nTALIESIN: That's real funny.\nMARISHA: Six?\nLAURA: Oh no!\nSAM: Keyleth's dead.\nORION: (whispers) No, they'll probably just put her in prison.","response":"DM: The guy holding the spear to you keeps it there. The other guy walks up behind and says, “Let me see your hands.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)\nLIAM: Shit.\nMARISHA: Why?","response":"DM: “Let me see your hands.” He takes your hands, pulls out a set of shackles–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)\nASHLEY: Oh no.","response":"DM: – and locks them on."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is the second time you've been arrested!\nMARISHA: Yeah, it is.","response":"DM: The guy with spear turns behind you and just holds it to your back as the gentleman who just cuffed you grabs the chain between and starts pulling you towards the main chamber."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You know, can we just buzz by the front foyer, and then we'll find my friends, and then we'll all be like, hey, those are my– It'll be fine.\nORION: I think that's where you're going.","response":"DM: He leads you down the stairway to an area where it opens up into a small courtyard, takes you to the right of the courtyard into a central chamber, where the rest of Vox Machina is currently being led."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Keyleth!\nORION: Do I see her?","response":"DM: Yeah, you guys all see her being led in, in cuffs, essentially."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Seriously? Again?\nTRAVIS: What did you do?\nLAURA: Again, Keyleth?\nORION: Your Highness, what is your problem?\nASHLEY: Oh. She's with us. She's with us, she was just outside, we got in before.\nTRAVIS: No, we don't know who she is.\nTALIESIN: Actually, can we have a few minutes to discuss this?\nMARISHA: Shut up, Grog!","response":"DM: At this point, Kima turns and says, “She's with me.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: And both the Scalebearers go, “Lady Kima, I am so sorry.” And they go ahead and take the cuffs off real fast and pull the spear back and step back."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wow.\nLAURA: Yeah, you listen to Lady Kima.\nORION: The classic.\nMARISHA: The classic.\nORION: The classic handcuff wrist twist.\nMARISHA: Ouch.\nLIAM: Hardass.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I'm with her.","response":"DM: They back off and bow deeply and escort themselves off, embarrassed."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Did you guys see that?\nASHLEY: That was cool.\nORION: I nudge Grog.\nTRAVIS: That was cool. You were arrested.\nORION: Grog, Grog, I'm nudging you.\nTRAVIS: You hadn't done anything.\nTALIESIN: I knew you had it in you.\nMARISHA: I'm starting to feel so hardcore.\nORION: I'm just nudging you.\nTRAVIS: Oh, okay.\nORION: Because Kima did something super hot.\nTALIESIN: You need a tattoo.\nMARISHA: I do need a tattoo.\nTRAVIS: I know, I noticed. She doesn't love me, though.\nLAURA: She does, Grog.\nTRAVIS: No, not yet.\nLAURA: Is everything okay, Pike?\nASHLEY: It's just– there's a lot of holiness here.\nORION: I would imagine.\nMARISHA: Oh.\nSAM: On a scale from one to five, five being super holy–\nASHLEY: Probably six.\nSAM: Whoa.\nLAURA: Whoa.\nMARISHA: (gasps)\nORION: That's extra holy.\nMARISHA: This temple goes to six.\nASHLEY: This temple, I mean this–\nASHLEY: Just this whole land in particular. I mean there's a lot, there's a lot here, but–\nORION: That is good, though.\nASHLEY: Yes, good.\nSAM: Do you need a moment? Do you need to sit down? Do you need me to hold you?\nASHLEY: I think I'm okay to keep going.\nASHLEY: But maybe later. We'll see. If I get a little tired.","response":"DM: At which you feel a nudge at your side and it's an armored elbow from Kima, saying, “If you wouldn't mind holding off on the fraternizing in the temple of Bahamut, I would really appreciate it.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, that's right.\nSAM: Message understood.","response":"DM: At which point Scalebearer Yonn is now at the second set of double doors and he presents his holy symbol above his chest, it glows a second, and what was originally just smooth stone doors, you see a divine glow and the symbol of Bahamut you saw at the front of the temple appear for a moment, and then as it vanishes the two doors open on their own into a central worship chamber. This is a much larger domed room. It looks like it goes up about 80 feet to the top of the ceiling, and the dome itself has what looks like an extremely ancient, detailed drawing, like Sistine Chapel-style, the tale of the entirety of creation. You see all the elemental planes represented in the corners, the theoretical corners, where corners would be in a domed room. You can see a crude representation of how all the planes lay over each other, you can see the Astral Plane, you can see where the Nine Hells would exist, and the Abyss itself, and in the center there's the Prime Material Plane, and across it you see a giant image of the great platinum dragon Bahamut drawn in all of his glory, currently snapping down on one of the throats of a multi-headed dragon. This other dragon, with five different heads of five different chromatic colors, and this struggle between what you know to be Bahamut and Tiamat."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Tiamat?","response":"DM: Tiamat."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is that the bad one?","response":"DM: You gather."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is the baddest one.\nLAURA: I mean, I know that because I know a lot about dragons.","response":"DM: Indeed."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Whoa. Do I see or learn anything about the elemental planes that I didn't know before?","response":"DM: Not from the artwork. It's very pretty."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ah, so pretty.\nORION: I take it all in and I'm reminded of one of the museums at home.","response":"DM: And actually, you've seen this art piece in a book. It's been a long time, but you know that this has been studied before and exists somewhere in Draconia, the tome that talks about this exact temple."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A book?\nMARISHA: We just made cave drawings, I don't–\nSAM: That's those square things.\nORION: The square things with all the paper leaves in them and squiggles.\nTRAVIS: Right.\nLAURA: Is Tiamat still alive? Is he still around?\nORION: I read a lot of those. Can't put my finger on it.","response":"DM: At which point both Yonn and Kima and the Scalebearers kind of turn to you with a look of– kind of understanding that you don't quite know, but also the fear and the knowledge that– they don't say anything, they just give you a look that says, yes, very much so."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Unfortunately, yes.","response":"DM: They continue walking."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: Now, the floor of this chamber, which is a very simple stone, you can see there are small sculptures, each one representing some sort of a humanoid entity dressed in similar robes to the other envoys and members of this temple that you've encountered thus far. Some of them are in full armor, some are wearing just robes, and they're very, very old. Some of them seem a little more recent, and you gather these each have some sort of cultural or religious significance to this temple. However, one of these is not a statue. In the center of this worship chamber, which is strangely, eerily quiet, there is one humanoid that turns to the rest of you. What you see before you is a slender, elven male draped in long, white robes that drag a few feet behind his form across the ground. He has jet– not jet, stark-white hair that is slicked back against his head, no facial hair, frail but very handsome features. Elves, when they age, they age very gracefully–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah we do.\nMARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: – and from the look of most elves you've seen, this is a very old elf that has aged very gracefully. He turns to the rest of you and you see across his neck a very, very well-crafted, intricate series of draconic symbols that finishes with a giant emblem of Bahamut himself. His voice rings out and echoes throughout the hallway as you approach, each footstep echoing as you get closer. “Welcome, everyone, to the Platinum Sanctuary. I am called Highbearer Vord.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, right.","response":"DM: “Keeper of this most holy of places. I received word from a disciple of mine–” At which Kima has now stepped forward, and bows, kneels before him and says, “Your holiness.” At which he looks down with a smile. “Ah, Kima. I am pleased to see you. It has been a long time, my disciple.” He looks up to the rest of the group. “I understand you carry something of terrible omen. Let us discuss how to be rid of it. Please. Present the container.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right here?","response":"DM: The Scalebearers step forward and set the container on the ground. They go to reach for it and he goes, “No no no. Do not open it.” And he kind of takes a second and holds his symbol to his chest and closes his eyes, and you can see this kind of divine glow pulse off of him for a second."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Kima, what's happening?","response":"DM: She goes, “Shh, shh.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: The box begins to pulse with the divine light as well, and then suddenly vanishes and he kind of (gasps) catches his breath. “It is as you said. This must be sealed immediately.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, yes.\nMARISHA: Yeah-huh. We could have just told you that.","response":"DM: He gives a look to the rest of the group here, and you can see there's a noticeable bead of sweat he kind of wipes off his forehead. “I just needed to confirm that this was not some haphazardly constructed fake or some other artifact mistaken for such a horn, but we indeed have within our presence one of the Horns of Orcus, and this does not bode well.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whistles)","response":"DM: “Thankfully–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are you guys– oh, sorry.","response":"DM: “No, please. What do you want to say?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I was just wondering. You've had one of these before, yes?","response":"DM: “No, but we know that these exist. A few of us do; the knowledge itself has been lost to time intentionally. It was brought to my attention, and through discussions with the Council that sent you on this journey, that this would be the safest place to seal such an artifact, and amongst all our other options, as of this time, I see no other choice. So. What's been proposed. Allow me to explain to you the plan. One of our most divine relics of our most beloved protector Bahamut was kept deep beneath this temple, within the mountain we rest against. The Star of Exaltation, a crystal born from the tear Bahamut shed for the sacrifices his first devoted made in the Great War of the Beginnings, the Dawn War. This item was unfortunately lost nearly 300 years ago, giving the last of its power to protect this very Vasselheim. The intervention it brought from our great deity expended and left the artifact destroyed. Since the chamber that held this Star, a blessed and ever-watched nexus beneath the gaze of the Great Platinum Dragon Himself, has gone empty, we've tended to it. We've kept it fairly well-watched and in the state it was originally constructed for. And we think no greater location to seal such a deeply-rooted evil exists within our spheres of influence or any other. Unfortunately, the last time the chamber was cleansed and prepared was some 15 years ago. Our curate tasked one of our own Scalebearers–” And he looks over towards Yonn, who sheepishly backs away. “– was tasked with preparing it for your arrival, and the artifact's, and it was found that the lower chambers have been infested with some manner of foul subterranean spider creature.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, man.","response":"DM: “Our Scalebearer fled.” At which point Yonn leaves the entire conversation and exits the room."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (quietly) Excuse me.\nSAM: Yonn.","response":"DM: You hear Kima kind of give a spit in his direction."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Will we have to contend with the defense systems as well?","response":"DM: “Not all of them, but apparently in his haste to escape and defend himself, he set a few of them to aid his escape.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Great. (shouts) Good job, Yonn!\nMARISHA: Thanks, Yonn.","response":"DM: You hear no response other than the pitter-patter of steps."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Why does he still work here?\nTALIESIN: Would you like to speak to his manager?\nSAM: Does he have tenure or something? Is it a union thing?","response":"DM: “He's been with us for many, many years, and he has great heart and devotion. Though addled may be his mind, he does bring much to the temple.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He has seniority.\nMARISHA: So wait, you said you lost the Crystal of Exaltation during the War of–","response":"DM: “It was destroyed during a siege of the city.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: During the War of what? Beginnings?","response":"DM: “The War of the Beginnings.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The War of the Beginnings.\nTALIESIN: That was close.\nMARISHA: And how long ago was this War of the Beginnings?","response":"DM: “Well that, oh, I'm sorry. It was created in the War of the Beginnings.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It was created then?","response":"DM: “It was lost in a battle, a siege of the city of Vasselheim 300 years ago.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 300 years?\nMARISHA: Called what? During what war?\nTALIESIN: The Siege of the Metal Champions.","response":"DM: “That had no particular name.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh.\nLAURA: Oh.\nMARISHA: Just a siege.\nLAURA: It was just a thing?","response":"DM: “It was one of the sieges and there was–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: The Battle Where the Thing Was Lost.","response":"DM: Yes. There it is."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Right.\nLIAM: Vord. Hi. Question, please. We'll clear out your basement, that's not a problem. I'd like to understand how you plan to protect this horn, how you plan to keep it out of the hands of entities who would use it for ill–\nLAURA: That big scary creature living out in the woods. Sorry, brother.\nLIAM: Then how– that's fine.","response":"DM: He glances towards you and says, “Oh, that is but one of many.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Huh.","response":"DM: “Let it be known that this temple is extremely well-guarded. It is continuously under the gaze of our patron deity and while some of the defenses have been put in place for your arrival, if the entirety of the vault is triggered, there is nothing that will make its way there unannounced.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Good sell.\nSAM: Are we to carry the box down as we journey into the dungeons below, or are we to leave it here while we go clear out the basement?","response":"DM: “The Scalebearers will bring it with you.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.","response":"DM: “Keep them safe.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So just to get one thing clear, and I mean no (clears throat) disrespect, but how was the crystal lost 300 years ago, if it was in this chamber? So this chamber has been broken into before?","response":"DM: “We can enter the chamber under very specific circumstances. We, at the time, requested the use of the Star of Exaltation as a divine\nfocus–”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh.","response":"DM: “– a ritual that required the intervention of Bahamut to keep the city safe.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, so someone brought it out and then was clumsy and lost it.\nLAURA: And then it was lost.\nSAM: And you know what–","response":"DM: “It wasn't clumsy and lost. It was used as a focus in the ritual.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh.","response":"DM: “It was by the will of Bahamut Himself that the Star no longer was required to exist on this plane.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: She gets it. She gets it.","response":"DM: “It served its purpose.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So it was destroyed.\nLAURA: Lost, as in–\nORION: Like not around.\nMARISHA: You should change your verbage here.\nTALIESIN: Charisma of ten, ladies and gentlemen. Charisma of ten.\nLAURA: While everybody's been talking, can I have used my Primeval Awareness to see within six miles if there's any dragons around us?\nSAM: (sings) Primeval Awareness, yeah.","response":"DM: So you take a moment and kind of zone out for a second. You do not sense any dragons in the immediate vicinity of the six-mile radius   the city, no."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (sings) Primeval Awareness, over.\nTRAVIS: Can we drop off this box, or what? I want to go see the fire dancers.\nSAM: Yeah, let's go.\nLAURA: No, we need to go– we also need to– are we going to do that now?\nSAM: Let's just go.\nLAURA: Go clear out the basement?\nSAM: Yeah, it's the morning, still. Okay? Let's go.\nORION: Are we all potioned up, are we all–\nMARISHA: Yeah, we're good.\nASHLEY: We're all healed.\nORION: We're good?\nLAURA: Let's clear out the basement.\nTRAVIS: There's nothing down there, right?\nLAURA: Yeah? I mean, you want us to do it now, yeah?\nTALIESIN: I'm not– I haven't been paying attention.","response":"DM: “Lest this artifact be left longer in the open, which I would not be comfortable with.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, neither would I.","response":"DM: “I would prefer this be taken care of immediately.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll do it now.\nSAM: Let's go do it.\nTALIESIN: We've got a bear.\nLAURA: I mean, obviously we want the Horn taken care of, but–\nTRAVIS: Here we go.\nLAURA: – you know, we're taking care of a problem for you, too.\nSAM: Oh, here it goes.\nTRAVIS: Here it comes.\nSAM: Here it goes.\nASHLEY: Get it, girl.\nTRAVIS: Son of a bitch.\nASHLEY: Get it, girl. Get it.\nLIAM: The holiest place on the map.\nLAURA: The holiest place?\nSAM: Haggle with the pope.\nTALIESIN: Shaking down the pope.","response":"DM: “You want a monetary reward–”"}

{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm not asking.","response":"DM: “The temple can provide a sum of three thousand gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Per party member, yes?","response":"DM: “Entirely. Three thousand gold pieces for your trouble on this journey.” At which Kima steps forward and says, “Highbearer, we do not need to take money from–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We don't want money, of course not. I mean, I–\nSAM: But think of the good we could do with that money, giving alms to the poor back home where we are.\nLAURA: Yes, spreading the word of Bahamut where we go.\nASHLEY: Are we going to return for it?\nSAM: We do a lot of charity work and it would be well-received back home. (under his breath) In our Keep.","response":"DM: You make a persuasion roll. You make a deception roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Deception?\nLAURA: It's not a deception, we really will–\nTRAVIS: No, no. Only one of you.\nTALIESIN: The ladies of the evening really, really do need the money, apparently.\nTRAVIS: What did you roll, Sam?\nSAM: A 30.\nLAURA: Oh. That's really good because I rolled a 19. Wait!\nMARISHA: A 30?\nASHLEY: No, you didn't.\nLAURA: Yeah, I did.\nLIAM: Three-zero?\nSAM: Three-zero! I have a +13 for deception.\nTRAVIS: Really?\nTALIESIN: That explains so much.\nTRAVIS: We've got to get you deceiving more.\nTRAVIS: Oh my god.\nMARISHA: You should lie more. It's good.\nTALIESIN: Lie to me, Pinocchio. Lie to me.","response":"DM: “Three thousand gold, at your disposal, to bring about and to share in the prosperity of your people back home.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Amen.","response":"DM: “Once the artifact is delivered and sealed.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: From one holy man to another, I think we've struck a deal. Let's go.\nORION: Burt Reynolds, you've done it again.\nTRAVIS: Amen.","response":"DM: As you all turn, Kima goes, “I'll show you to the vault room.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are you going to come with us, Kima?","response":"DM: “Yes, I'm coming with you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, good.","response":"DM: She glances over at you. (sarcastically) “Shall we, holy man?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Why yes, my sister, lead the way.\nMARISHA: Sister.","response":"DM: As you guys are walking out of the chamber, the doors close behind, she turns to you and says, “Is that why you were blessed with such a temporarily swollen appendage before?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't know how the lord works, it's mysterious.","response":"DM: “Let us be on our way.” She kind of walks off, flustered and frustrated. You guys are led down two layers. This actual temple recedes further and further into the mountain, until you're led into what seems to almost be a storage basement. It's a very musty smell. It's old earth–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's dank down here.","response":"DM: Yeah, it kind of has that moldy scent to it. There are five guards stationed in this storage vicinity, and as you approach, they all stand up. They're all still wearing ceremonial armor, two of which you can see are really well-armed, one with a greatsword and one with a longsword at the side. They look pretty prestigious to be assigned to a basement this terrible."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: At ease, soldiers.","response":"DM: “Of course, of course.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are we going to find any of these defenses right away, or what?","response":"DM: Kima kind of gives you a look, shrugs, and, “To be perfectly honest, I have not been within the vault.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well.\nASHLEY: Okay.\nMARISHA: Huh. Is there a blueprint somewhere?\nTRAVIS: Liam, you're up. I mean, (clears throat) Vax.\nSAM: I thought he was Vex.\nLIAM: Sorry, my communication earring was a little low there. What was said?\nLAURA: Check for some traps, brother.\nLIAM: You got it. You got it. I'm glad to get out of upstairs, I mutter to my sister, because the decor up there was shit.\nLIAM: That is… high. That was a 26.","response":"DM: 26 for?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Traps in the stairway.\nLIAM: Just traps.\nORION: Oh! Light!","response":"DM: Okay. The brief moment of light, before your eyes can really focus in, there's a flash of light at the end of Tiberius's staff, and the room actually gets harder to see. You see there is a thick white mist that just kind of hangs in the air throughout the entirety of this room."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! (fssh)\nMARISHA: It's like having your high-beams on when it's foggy.\nORION: I de-cast Light.","response":"DM: Okay. You dispel the Light."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What is all of this poppycock?","response":"DM: Your eyes adjust a little bit, and you can see what looks like– this room, for the most part, doesn't have any sort of details. There are a couple of sconces with low, flickering light that are embedded in the side of the walls of this 50 foot by 50 foot room. It's about 20 feet high."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I go ahead and I do a little Wind Gust and I go, (blows air).","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Down the hall, to clear out the fog.","response":"DM: Which spell is this?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Gust of Wind.","response":"DM: Okay, so you cast Gust of Wind. The mist that was filling this room blows out the other side and you can see, the room is a little more visible now."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, very good. Light!","response":"DM: There's still a light mist on the sides, but the center of the walkway is clear for a second. You see now in the center of the room what were initially just dark spots in the mist, there are two pillars that are attached from ceiling to floor, roughly about 20 feet apart from each other, kind of in the center of each side of the room. Each pillar is solid gray stone with what looks like intricately carved small dragons almost curling and wrapping around the statues. Each one of their heads kind of turned, mouth opened kind of angrily in different directions."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I check for traps or see if there's anything–\nTRAVIS: You should re-cast that.","response":"DM: You guys, both of you guys make perception checks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: That's a 19.\nLAURA: Oh, he already rolled. Look at him.\nLIAM: Yeah.\nLAURA: Perception?","response":"DM: Mm-hm."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 25.","response":"DM: So looking about, Liam– Sorry, Vax. You notice the base of each one of these pillars is not flush with the floor. There is a slight gap, meaning there is some sort of a rotation or a pivot to these pillars."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hm.","response":"DM: You notice that these mouths of the dragons seem to be what's creating this white mist, and as time progresses, the mist begins to refill up the room rather quickly."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Should we run through?\nORION: While we're standing around, I'd like to reassign the earrings to Vax, Grog, and Scanlan.\nLAURA: I don't get one anymore? You're taking it off of me right now?\nORION: Because we're always together, we're always kind of in the back together, and they're always kind of like up in the fray, so–\nTRAVIS: That's true, I do wander off easily.\nSAM: Oh, is that you, Grog?\nORION: She's always kind of like in the middle. She's the wild card. He's always in the back with us also because we're the ranged dudes.\nMARISHA: Wait, do I still have one?\nTALIESIN: I'm putting down my mask, just in case this is awful.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys are still at the stairway. The mist has now filled the room again in front of you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh. Should we try breathing it and see what happens?\nSAM: Yeah, sure.\nMARISHA: My Gust of Wind–\nLAURA: I just reach my arm into the mist and just see–\nMARISHA: My Gust of Wind lasts up to one minute, by the way, so I can keep–\nLAURA: Oh, maybe we should just not touch the mist and go straight through the room.\nMARISHA: I'm just airbending.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You've been wanting to say that.\nLAURA: So you can blow it and we just walk through?","response":"DM: As this conversation has continued– let's say about 30 or 40 seconds has gone by in transferring the earrings and the discussion, so there's still a little bit of– there is a clear pathway in the center there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Not much time.\nSAM: Let's go.\nLAURA: Should we go?\nSAM: Let's go through.\nLAURA: Let's go before it gets back.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nASHLEY: I start running.\nTALIESIN: Yes, go, run.\nLIAM: Hustle, hustle.\nLAURA: Go, go, go.","response":"DM: Okay. You all start running through. You're running through with them and keeping concentration on your spell."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Vax, check for traps!\nSAM: Vorak, Desona, come!\nLAURA: I perception-checked the room. It didn't seem like there was anything.\nORION: Oh, are we good? Okay.\nLIAM: I'm running ten feet ahead of everybody. I rolled a big old one.\nSAM: He tripped.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wow.","response":"DM: You continue forward, and as you're rushing through the group, not paying attention, you gently hit the edge of the mist barrier with your shoulder, as you're rushing to the side instinctually to stealth along the wall. As your shoulder breaks the mist–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Bring it.","response":"DM: All of the dragon mouths burst into bright fiery flame and begin spinning rapidly in the room. The people that are in the center running through right now, which include Keyleth, Scanlan, Tiberius, and Pike, all of you guys make dexterity saving throws."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What?!\nSAM: Whoa!\nMARISHA: Son of a bitch.\nLAURA: Vax!\nSAM: Way to go, Vax.\nTALIESIN: Teacher, teacher, did I have time to finish my book?","response":"DM: You have."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes!\nASHLEY: Dexterity check?\nLIAM: You said dex save? Dex save?","response":"DM: Dex save, yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 18.","response":"DM: 18?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Mm-hm.\nSAM: Oh! 13.","response":"DM: 13."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Three.\nLIAM: 26.\nMARISHA: Also 13.\nASHLEY: But I'm short! I'm so short. They would–\nLAURA: Super duper short.\nTRAVIS: Just going to hit you in the face.\nASHLEY: They would just flow right over me.","response":"DM: Okay. As the flames just burst out throughout the room, tearing into the air with this reddish-white flame, both Vax and Tiberius manage to try and dodge out of the way as best they can, only receiving, each of them–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, all Vax has to do is roll, because he's already on the freaking ground.","response":"DM: 12 points of fire damage to each of you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: To who?\nLIAM: Well, rogue with Uncanny Dodge, for a successful save gets zero damage.","response":"DM: You take none."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I take half.","response":"DM: So you take zero damage, you take 12."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So I take half. Is it 24 total?","response":"DM: No, 24 total. You take half."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh.\nMARISHA: The rest of us?","response":"DM: Scanlan, Keyleth, and Pike all take 24 points of fire damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ugh.\nASHLEY: I got 24 points.\nMARISHA: Ouch.\nORION: Oh! My robe.\nSAM: Ow. Are we still moving?\nLIAM: Tuck and roll.\nORION: Are you getting used to your new foot, Vax?\nLIAM: I'm back!","response":"DM: You guys move through– that's the four of you guys. Percy, Grog, and Vex and Trinket are all behind, as they watch the flames burst out and they all kind of stop their inertia, and now the mist slowly fills up the room."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Whoa.","response":"DM: About the time that your spell wears off for the first minute."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. (weak chuckle) Let's move?\nTRAVIS: It fills up the room?\nLAURA: We're still in the room.\nSAM: The three of us, you're still back.","response":"DM: You guys are split right now, with the bearers, the Scalebearers."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, they're coming with us, they're like coming with us through the whole thing?","response":"DM: They're with you, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, hang on.\nLAURA: Keyleth, blow the smoke again. Blow the mist away. If you can.","response":"DM: Oh, no."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: We run through it.\nLAURA: And now we run.\nMARISHA: Oh, no. He doesn't care.\nTRAVIS: He doesn't care.\nTALIESIN: No, we walk gently through.","response":"DM: Burning the second spell slot. (wind noise) The mist clears itself. Now that you're aware of what it does, you're very careful to direct it towards the center and leave an open path. The rest of you rush through, including the Scalebearers, in the minute you have. The wind is blowing in your face from Keyleth's position. It's kind of like stepping into the force of a hurricane. You have to put your hand in front of you to see–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (shouts) Your breath smells pretty good, though, Keyleth.\nMARISHA: Thanks, I tried to get a little of a sage thing.\nASHLEY: Sagey rosemary?\nTRAVIS: Very minty.\nMARISHA: A little orange blossom. It's nice.\nORION: I'm going to Prestidigitate a tiny air shield in front of me.\nLIAM: When I bite into a York Peppermint Patty–\nMARISHA: It's also pure oxygen, so we could get a little buzz.","response":"DM: It's a very, very tiny shield. It protects this much of your face."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's what I'm doing.","response":"DM: Your eyes are fine. The rest of your robes are still (windblown cloth sounds)."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.","response":"DM: You guys all make your way across the room. You then finish your spell and the mist immediately fills up and completely obfuscates that room behind you once more."}
{"prompt":"SAM: One down!\nMARISHA: We made it!\nSAM: 20 rooms to go.","response":"DM: You're now in what is a ten-foot-wide chamber for an additional– a tunnel or hallway– for another 20 feet before it opens up into another room, but there is no light source in there whatsoever. You, with Light on your staff again, you kind of step ahead to–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do you want to shoot an arrow in?\nORION: Oh, would you like to see?\nLAURA: Yeah, let's do it.\nORION: Yeah, very good. Light.\nLAURA: 16.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 29.\nLAURA: He's better.","response":"DM: Okay. You notice that across this floor of the circular room, there are these circles marked across the entirety of the surface here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Great. Those are probably traps.\nTRAVIS: I bet those are fun.\nLAURA: Pressure plates, maybe?\nORION: Okay, or sigils or– maybe we have to activate them or not activate them?\nTRAVIS: I have darkvision, now with a range of 60 feet.\nSAM: Can we see to the other side of the room?","response":"DM: Hm?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can we see all the way to the other side of the room?","response":"DM: Opposite side, there is actually a much larger opening and what looks to be another staircase that descends. This one is 20 feet wide. It's a very wide staircase from what you're used to seeing, especially in these structures."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And I'm hoping there's no door.","response":"DM: No doorway. It's open. It just descends down below. And the only way you can tell is that the arrow arcs across–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Everybody stand back. I'm going to click my Boots of Haste–\nLAURA: What? Shouldn't we throw something onto one of the pressure plates first and see what it does?\nLIAM: Yeah, me. I'm going to click my Boots of Haste, I'm going to run, I'm going to do a sort of a running roll, land on the closest circle and wait for half a tick and then roll off of it.\nLAURA: Are you kidding me?!\nORION: What are you doing?\nTRAVIS: No, no, let him do it! Let him do it.","response":"DM: So as you guys are about to go, “Wait!”, Vax is already off. Clicks the boots. The arcane magic of the Boots of Haste kick into his body. He leaps forward. Make an acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. 22.\nTRAVIS: I hope you get your eyebrows burned off.\nSAM: Oh, boy.\nLAURA: Vax!\nORION: I click my earring. You're an idiot, Vax.\nLIAM: I'm going to use Luck because that blew. And that's a natural 20.\nSAM AND MARISHA: Oh!\nASHLEY: Oh snap.\nORION: Yeah, 20!\nASHLEY: Yeah, 20.\nMARISHA: Yeah!","response":"DM: So. You barely manage to move out of the way before that circular portion of the ground skyrockets up like a pillar– one very similar to the one that you created for your spell– slams into the ceiling with a heavy thud, retracts, and continues again. In fact, looking around you, all of them in the room are now, at different levels, pistoning into the ceiling. (repeated crashing rock noises) This entire room is slowly rotating and there's just a series of pillars mashing into the ceiling."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, it's like a mini-game.","response":"DM: You have to make an acrobatics check to try and get through this now because you have very little space to move."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.\nLIAM: I'm going to use Luck again.\nLIAM: That is 18.","response":"DM: 18. You manage to make your way halfway across the room, dodging out of the way as these pillars are slamming and retracting. Kind of use the pattern of when they're pulling down from the ceiling, but they're moving very fast. One of them manages to catch you underneath your ankle. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw again."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is 15.\nTRAVIS: Uh-oh.\nASHLEY: You're going to hurt your foot again, Vax.","response":"DM: It catches you, takes you off of your balance, and it rockets you towards the ceiling. You manage to pull most of your body out of the way in time, but it still catches the back of your shoulder blade. You take 40 points of crushing damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes! (cackles)\nSAM: Ohhh!\nMARISHA: Holy shit.","response":"DM: As you are slammed into the ceiling. And as the pillar retracts, you roll off with a heavy wheeze of pain. (groan) Catching onto your feet again. Make one more acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh my god. If you get crushed to death–\nLIAM: That's a 23.","response":"DM: What was that?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 23.","response":"DM: 23."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm like an acrobatic cheetah. 23.","response":"DM: 23. You manage to– in the severe pain you're feeling, you can tell there's probably some serious bruising in there and you probably broke a couple of ribs, but you manage to just barely dodge and leap out of the way, making your way across the room to where the staircase descends, out of the immediate danger."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ah.\nLAURA: Jeez.","response":"DM: The rest of you now are standing on the opposite side of this room, which is currently a rotating grinding mill."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That was great.\nLIAM: I'd like to check if there's any kind of device or anything on this side–\nORION: Okay, hold on a second, Vax, just chill out for a minute. We all just took a little damage this last time.\nLIAM: I'm just trying a perception check.\nSAM: He's checking. He's checking.\nMARISHA: For a lever or something.\nTRAVIS: For a switch.\nLIAM: 25.\nSAM: 25.","response":"DM: 25. You can see, in the ceiling, in the very, very center of the room, precariously placed right where one of the pillars in the center slams into the ceiling, there appears to be a small quarter-sized hole, gold piece-sized hole in the ceiling."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah, come on, Vex.\nTALIESIN: Race you for it.","response":"DM: It's in the middle of the room. In the ceiling, where–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is there a clear shot of it or is there (bang bang bang) going on?","response":"DM: Oh, no, it's still going. The pillars are still slamming into the roof. And that one hole you see is right where one of the pillars slams into the roof. You only see it intermittently when the pillar retracts."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Go, sharpshooters, go.\nTALIESIN: You first, or me?\nLAURA: Well, let's try this first because you might just break it down completely.\nTALIESIN: Oh, very well.\nLAURA: You are much more powerful than I am, Percy.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, ladies first, perhaps.\nTALIESIN: Ladies first.","response":"DM: You can. This is a hard shot because it's at an angle now. We're talking, this is Robin Hood-level split-the-arrow. Because you have to hit it and then ricochet upward to see if it'll have any effect."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise.\nTRAVIS: Well, get up there.\nMARISHA: I place my hands on her shoulders–\nTRAVIS: Can you inspire?\nSAM: I can inspire her.\nMARISHA: And I give her Enhance Ability.\nSAM: Ooh, Enhance Ability.\nLAURA: Okay, what does that mean?\nMARISHA: You have advantage on– oh, ability checks. It's just ability checks.","response":"DM: Ability checks. It's not going to help for an attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is, what, an attack?\nMARISHA: Never mind.","response":"DM: This would be an attack."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would like to offer my beard for a rub of good luck.\nLAURA: Thanks, Grog.","response":"DM: As you offer the beard, it tears off."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What?\nASHLEY: Oh, no!\nTRAVIS: What did you do?!\nLAURA: You know what, I'm going to tie this to the arrow. It's going to give it really good luck.\nSAM: That seems like it's aerodynamically–\nLAURA: I'm not actually going to tie it to the arrow.\nTALIESIN: Okay!\nLAURA: I'm just going to tuck it–","response":"DM: Mark in your inventory, you now have Fake Grog Rope Beard."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is that a minus one to my confidence now?\nTRAVIS: (cries)\nORION: So the goal is to shoot an arrow into this– like the Death Star?","response":"DM: Essentially, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nORION: Okay, cool. As I see her ready, I'm going to hold up my hand with my ring and point it right at that hole.","response":"DM: To do–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So you can deflect it if I–\nORION: I got your back.\nORION: Get it, Vex.\nSAM: I'm going to inspire her. With inspiration. I'll sing, (sings) Ooh ooh, shut up and shoot that hole! Your arrow is my destiny, yeah I said,\nALL: (sings) Ooh ooh, shut up and shoot that hole!","response":"DM: And with that, you feel your focus, you wait, you breathe in, you breathe out, you breathe in, you breathe out in pattern with the slamming of the piston against the ceiling."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I'm so nervous.\nASHLEY: Get it, get it, get it, you're going to do it.","response":"DM: You let out all your breath and you hold, hold, hold, waiting between heartbeats, and then (twwt), release. Go ahead and make your attack roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to roll the fancy one we got last week.\nLIAM: Get it, girl. Get it.","response":"DM: Yes, you do."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Plus an inspiration.\nLAURA: Plus an inspiration dice?","response":"DM: Plus a d10."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, shit.\nMARISHA: (whispering) It's so quiet.\nORION: I know.\nLAURA: Oh, that's awesome! Okay. 35.\n(yelling)\nTRAVIS: Good inspiration.","response":"DM: As you release the arrow, you see the pillars slamming. The pillar comes down just as the arrow crests over it, past another pillar that just barely manages to miss it by a segment."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I cast Telekinesis to swoop it up.\n(whoosh)\nSAM: Oh, god.\nORION: Just to help and guide it.\nASHLEY: No, but it's already gone in.\nTRAVIS: We don't need it! We don't need it!\nLAURA: Oh, let me just see if I got it first!\nLIAM: She rolled a 35, we don't need shit.\nORION: It's going in there, anyway. I don't even have to roll.","response":"DM: So. As the pillar pulls down, the arrow goes cascading forward. Go ahead and make a d20 roll with the plus five modifier."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sweet. That's 17.","response":"DM: 17? Okay. So as the arrow makes its way, it ricochets off the bottom edge of the actual hole and immediately bends itself upward, the shaft bending. As it begins to start heading up the hole, there's a sudden force of arcane energy that slams it even harder up into the top of this tiny little slit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, good.","response":"DM: As it goes up there, you hear what sounds like a splintering of wood and metal. Then you hear metal grinding. You start seeing bits and chunks of grinding metal begin to pour out of the hole and the pillars begin to (scraping stone)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hey.\nASHLEY: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Nice shot!\nASHLEY: Yeah, Vex!","response":"DM: Eventually coming to a halt."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: A wrench in the machine.\nTALIESIN: I could have done it.\nLAURA: You totally could have done that.\nTALIESIN: I could have made that shot.\nSAM: Next room's yours.\nTALIESIN: Yes, next room, next room's all mine.\nORION: That was one of those impossible things, right?","response":"DM: Pretty damn close to impossible."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I knew it.\nLAURA: Nice.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we walk across.\nLIAM: As they come to the other side, I clutch my broken rib and injuredly hold a hand up and give a half-assed high-five to my sister. (grunts)\nLAURA: Good job getting slammed into the roof like that.\nLIAM: Yeah, you're welcome.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: So can we take a short rest to heal up and then also a short rest to take a short rest in real life?","response":"DM: You can. We're going to go ahead and stop here. You're now taking a short rest."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: You guys take a moment. If you want to go ahead and heal up using any of your hit dice, you're able to, Vax."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to do that.\nSAM: Me, too.","response":"DM: And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take our five-minute break here, guys."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Cool.\nSAM: Five.\nSAM: Let's do it.\nLAURA: Woo.","response":"DM: So we're going to take a five-minute break."}
{"prompt":"SAM: True five. True five.","response":"DM: Welcome back."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: I had a really quick announcement before we get back into the game. The winner is Paula Konito, so congratulations–\nMARISHA: Paula Konito!","response":"DM: Paula Konito, congrats!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Paula Konito!\nZAC: – and I understand that we crashed their website for donations–\nASHLEY: What?\nZAC: So congratulations, guys, for crashing the website, but what is not crashed is our donation link, so if you scroll down and click on the 826LA link, all of the donations that are made tonight they've said will go to GameChanger.\nLAURA: Yeah, the portion of the donations that would normally go to 826LA tonight are going to go to GameChanger.\nTRAVIS: That's amazing.\nLAURA: Oh, awesome.\nORION: Nice!\nZAC: So the mods will keep spamming that throughout the weekend and you guys can donate throughout the rebroadcast and things like that for a one-dollar Deus Ex code.\nLAURA: Anything over a dollar.\nZAC: Anything over a dollar, yeah.","response":"DM: That's so awesome."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: One-oh-one! Enjoy Deus Ex.","response":"DM: Yeah! Thank you guys so much."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It would be good if you donated more than one dollar, if you want.\nTALIESIN: It's still needed.","response":"DM: The Critters are strong. The Critters are legion."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It is. They are.","response":"DM: It's amazing the things we can do."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It is on. YES.\nTALIESIN: There are Critters in the walls.\nMARISHA: They're in the god–\nMARISHA AND TALIESIN: – damn walls!\nTALIESIN: Thank you for being there with me on that.\nLAURA: Oh, god, okay.","response":"DM: You guys, after finishing your short rest, healing up various wounds in that circumstance–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (plays note on flute)","response":"DM: You make your way, playing a fancy little ditty on the flute. You make your way down this long, long staircase. You continue down for, I'd say, probably a good hundred feet or so before you start encountering, I'll say, a mild change in the scenery, at least. What was normally just a musty hallway is becoming thicker and thicker coated with large spiderwebs."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh.\nTRAVIS: Awesome.\nORION: Everything's so sticky.\nASHLEY: Spiders!","response":"DM: You manage to push through and cut through, but it gets to the point where it's just so matted you guys are having to bushwhack your way through as if you had a machete."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm not taking off my mask.\nTRAVIS: Can I turn to one of those (clears throat) Scalebearers and ask if they've ever dealt with any umber-hulks in this region.","response":"DM: Scalebearer Vorak gives kind of a curious look to your question. Scalebearer Desona looks to you and says, “No, I don't believe they exist in this region. Nor this close to the surface, as far as I know.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right. That's important, isn't it.\nORION: Are the spiderwebs– are they becoming more as we traverse–","response":"DM: Yes, they're getting thicker and thicker."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, so I'm going to make my way towards the front of the group because I'm noticing this and I'm going to do a Fire Breath, and I'm going to instantly cast Control Flame and catch as much as I can of it, and start spinning it, burning the webs as we go.","response":"DM: Okay. Very cool. So, Tiberius steps forward and breathes a heating breath of dragon fire out of his mouth. As it cascades forward, burning through the nearby webs, he casts a secondary spell and captures it and begins to shape it, almost like it's a fiery clay in the middle of the air. And he utilizes it in a very similar way to how he uses Telekinesis and begins to use that rolling fire to burn through the webbing as you guys continue down the stairway."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice.\nTALIESIN: That's convenient.\nMARISHA: At least it'll be disinfected.\nORION: Mm-hm-hm. Fire cleans all.","response":"DM: It also leaves a terrible stench. Burning web has this awful kind of–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Burnt hair?","response":"DM: It's similar. Burnt hair with burnt plastic, if you can think of it– it's awful."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What's plastic?","response":"DM: This is more for your own player knowledge, sensory knowledge."}
{"prompt":"(groaning)\nLAURA: I stealth immediately.\nMARISHA: Oh, that frickin' sound. Do we– I can try to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, if we want to sneak through here.\nLAURA: Oh, yeah, that would be good!\nMARISHA: Do you want to try to sneak through?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, do it.\nMARISHA: I cast Pass Without a Trace.\nTRAVIS: Now let's vogue. This changes every time!\nORION: Sweet!\nLAURA: So, with the Pass Without a Trace?","response":"DM: With the Pass Without a Trace, yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 31.\nORION: (quietly, to Marisha) Is my magic on stealth, too?\nLIAM: 24.","response":"DM: With the plus ten?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Plus ten from what? Say again?\nLAURA: Pass Without a Trace.","response":"DM: Keyleth cast Pass Without a Trace."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, 34.\nORION: I back up! I have my cloak on. And I'm going to go ahead and cast Stoneskin. That's what I do right now.","response":"DM: You cast Stoneskin? I'm going to go ahead and ask–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm also going to cast Stoneskin.\nLAURA: Can I cast, while they're coming– where did I write it down?\nSAM: I'm going to go invisible.\nLAURA: Never mind, I can't find my spell.\nSAM: This is exciting, guys. There's a board of some sort.\nLAURA: I cast Entangle on the ground.","response":"DM: In front?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nSAM: You have– you can cast things?\nLAURA: (quickly) Yeah, yeah, yeah!\nORION: (quietly) Yeah, she's a ranger, she can cast stuff.\nTRAVIS: Apparently.\nTALIESIN: As long as it's at range.\nSAM: Grog, you've got a beard spell.\nTRAVIS: I do.\nTALIESIN: That was my terrible joke and I wish I hadn't. Now I'm embarrassed.\nTRAVIS: I can also cast Flatulence.\nSAM: And you have Frenzied Rage.\nLAURA: I'm reading it now.","response":"DM: Go ahead and read the spell."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Did I manage to catch with the Control Flame my entire Fire Breath when I did that? And I'm controlling it still?","response":"DM: Currently you are."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that's not what it was. That's the wrong spell. Sorry, sorry, it's Spike Growth, is the spell.\nSAM: Spikes growth?\nLAURA: I cast Spike Growth.","response":"DM: Spike Growth, okay, that is different."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, which is– the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. It's difficult terrain for the duration, but anybody that can see me casting it doesn't take damage to it, it's only the people that don't see me casting it.\nMARISHA: Dope.\nSAM: Really?\nLAURA: Yeah. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a wisdom check.\nORION: Cool.","response":"DM: They can see the area."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh. Well, that's not quite the same thing, then, what I saw. (yells) Forget it, my spell is stupid!\nSAM: No, no!\nORION: It's fine, just not in a hallway with stairs.\nLAURA: I know!\nSAM: It's fine, just stick to arrows, really.\nASHLEY: She can do so much more than just arrows!\nORION: As I see this, can I release my Control Flame and let the Fire Breath just happen, and not control it anymore?","response":"DM: Looking into your spell now. Oh, Control Flames is a cantrip. You are able to control just enough fire to burn away the things. It wouldn't actually do any damage if released. Control Fire kind of like captures an element of it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay. So that's what I was using, the element of what I did.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So I used it so I could have the fire.","response":"DM: Exactly."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Got it.","response":"DM: You set it as a catalyst to it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They can see the ground.","response":"DM: They can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Then no, don't cast it.\nTRAVIS: Doesn't it mess up the ground if we try to walk through it?\nLAURA: Not you guys, but they–\nMARISHA: But they're spiders. They're probably not that wise.\nORION: Can I cast something else?","response":"DM: No. Right now everyone rolls initiative."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Damn it!\nASHLEY: Ugh.","response":"DM: There are only so many things you can do here, Tiberius."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I know, but I like doing lots of things.","response":"DM: I know you do."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's not bad! I'll take that.\nSAM: I lost my dice.\nLAURA: That's my punishment.\nTRAVIS: Fuck, yeah.\nTALIESIN: I love my new stats.\nLAURA: I don't think that should count.\nTALIESIN: I rolled terribly this time but my stats are good.\nSAM: Every time, every time.\nORION: What?\nSAM: I've never rolled a double digit initiative roll, ever.","response":"DM: Oh, Scanlan, but you roll when it counts."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Just Wil Wheaton roll every time you do initiative.\nTALIESIN: Is that what we're calling it? Wheatoning?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, Wheatoning.\nLAURA: Wheatoning? Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Wheatoning.\nSAM: (announcer voice) Wha-Wha-Wheaton.\nASHLEY: Natural 20.\n(yelling)\nASHLEY: I don't think that ever happens when it's like damage or something.","response":"DM: That's okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 23.\nASHLEY: I'm gonna go with it.","response":"DM: Okay, so 23. Grog, what have you got?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 21.","response":"DM: Okay, so we've got Vex, Grog, and Pike, what's your dex? What's your initiative bonus?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Nothing.\nMARISHA: 17.","response":"DM: 17, Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 15.\nTALIESIN: 16.\nLAURA: He's gone.","response":"DM: Has left the screen."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, really?\nSAM: Great.\nASHLEY: Last.","response":"DM: I'm going to consider that a low initiative."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh-ho-ho-ho.\nORION: He just went to go poop.\nSAM: Seven!","response":"DM: Seven for Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Or deal with–\nASHLEY: (yells) Vax!\nMARISHA: Wait, there he is.\nSAM: He's holding a cat.\nORION: He has a cat.\nSAM: It's Trinket! It's Trinket!","response":"DM: What did you roll for initiative?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is a 16.","response":"DM: 16?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Get your head out of your ass.\nSAM: He's Dr. Evil.\nLAURA: Me?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! I'm going to cast Conjure Barrage at all of the spiders coming at us.\nLAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark whatever one looks the biggest.","response":"DM: Okay, from this position you will also hit Tiberius to hit all the spiders."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, where am I?","response":"DM: You're right here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: I mean, you could–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to move to where I'm in the middle of them. I'm still kind of stuck.","response":"DM: Right there?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Get it!\nLAURA: Yeah, and then I'll Conjure Barrage from there.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (quietly) Don't encourage it.\nLAURA: I cast Hunter's Mark on the biggest one I see.","response":"DM: Okay, this one here is one of the larger ones."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: So I'm going to go ahead and mark that one. So go ahead and– Conjure Barrage does what damage?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (quietly) Hate it.\nLAURA: It does 3d8 on all creatures.","response":"DM: Do they get a saving throw?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They get– yes, they do. They get half-damage if they save.","response":"DM: Mmkay. What's the DC on your spells?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (in a funny gruff voice) My DC is 14.\nORION: (mimicking Laura's gruff voice) MemememememeME.\nMARISHA: What's your DC, girl?\nLAURA: Okay.\nMARISHA: What's yo digits? Gimme those stats.","response":"DM: Okay, all you need–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do I need to roll for attack?","response":"DM: Only this one makes it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, sweet!","response":"DM: No, the barrage just happens. They're all caught in it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, cool.","response":"DM: So all of them take full damage, except for this one takes half damage, so go ahead and roll the damage on that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. 3d8. 15, and then 20 for the big one with the Hunter's Mark.\nLAURA: Can I have Trinket attack?","response":"DM: Trinket–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that's a lot of them.","response":"DM: Well, that, and the spell you cast was an action. Trinket can attack as part of your attack round."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, so I get a second attack?","response":"DM: Well, no, your spell was an action. So that's your turn. You do Conjure Barrage instead of your attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Cool, I'm going to step back against the wall.\nLAURA: Nah, he can't really get anywhere, it's fine.\nLAURA: It's good times, guys.","response":"DM: Angrily, a growl in the distance. Grog, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'd like to hold my turn.\nSAM: What?\nORION: Ooh, yeah!\nORION: Strategy.\nMARISHA: Must be something good.","response":"DM: Pike, you're up."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, how far can I move up to use a Spiritual Weapon? I can't tell where I'm at. I'm sorry, I didn't wear my glasses.","response":"DM: I mean, you can move through your allies without an issue. You can shift through your own guys without a problem."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like to cast a golden spiderweb of thorns.\nSAM: Ooh.\nLAURA: (gasps) What?\nMARISHA: Ooh.\nTALIESIN: Fancy.\nASHLEY: And encase the spiders.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's cool.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Like a thorny net.","response":"DM: This would be considered a net, if we are considering a weapon that you are conjuring for this."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm just making it look really pretty.","response":"DM: Right."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Basically.\nTRAVIS: (quietly) It looks so pretty.","response":"DM: So the effect of this– I'm letting you hit multiple guys with this. It would not do any damage."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: It wouldn't do any damage, it would just contain them?","response":"DM: It would possibly have an effect on their ability–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Even if they're thorny? Even like holy thorns? Oh.","response":"DM: It would be very itchy for them."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh. Well, I mean, that's not out of–\nLAURA: I think you should stick with it, it's awesome.\nSAM: Yeah, man, commit.\nASHLEY: Okay. Contain them.\nORION: Yeah, it's thematic.\nASHLEY: Contain them and then somebody could just–\nLAURA: Fireball.\nASHLEY: Throw fire, a fireball at them.\nASHLEY: Okay. 12.","response":"DM: 12? Okay. These four in the immediate front, right there, as you bring back your mace in the air, you kind of hang onto the side with the leather strap around your wrist. You reach up and grab your holy symbol. As you release the holy symbol to hold your hand up, divine energy streaks out from your fingertips and forms into this kind of gold and silver net. As your arm is doing this kind of throwing animation in the air like that, the net shoots out from the front and spreads down onto the spiders and contracts around. You can see it catches them and they start scrambling inside. These front four are considered grappled."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Cool.\nLAURA: Nice!\nMARISHA: Nice!","response":"DM: That's it? That brings it to Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, with that new development–\nORION: Wait. Can you do lightning?\nMARISHA: I can. I'm going to do Poison Spray, though. Where am I right now?","response":"DM: You're right here. Behind Pike as she threw her giant golden net."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to be like, 'scuse me, 'scuse me, Pike, 'scuse me. Sorry, sorry.\nASHLEY: Yes? Oh, go through, go through, go go go!\nMARISHA: Thank you, thank you, thank you.\nASHLEY: Tag you in! Tag you in!\nMARISHA: (whoosh) Poison Spray! It's a ten-foot cone.","response":"DM: Ten-foot cone. If you want to get right up in here you could get these three there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'll do that.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (whoosh) So, it's a constitution saving throw.","response":"DM: Okay. This one succeeds, this one fails, this one fails."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, so they take 2d12. Six. Ugh. Seven damage.","response":"DM: Seven damage to each."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's not great. I think he takes half damage, though, even though he fails.","response":"DM: Does he? I think Poison Mist–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Poison Spray.","response":"DM: Oh, Poison Spray. It's a cantrip. I think it's damage or nothing."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, yeah, I guess so.\nMARISHA: Can I get out of everyone's way?","response":"DM: You're currently– actually, down from where you cast it, you would be able to move out, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I back up a little bit? Yeah.","response":"DM: You can, they're still grappled."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I just kind of want to– yeah.\nMARISHA: Your turn!","response":"DM: That ends your turn. Vax, Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Please, be my guest.\nLIAM: Did you say Vax, Percy?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yep.\nLIAM: I'm doing my best seeing from where I can see here. Keyleth is right in front of me?","response":"DM: She was. She just pulled behind you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I moved behind.\nLAURA: Now you're in front of the spiders.\nMARISHA: You're good, you're in front.\nLIAM: Okay, there's a little bit of distance, so I'm just going to start hucking daggers at them. I'm going to start with dagger of life stealing.\nMARISHA: You're only two squares away.\nLIAM: That is a 16 to hit.","response":"DM: 16 to hit? Hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so that is four, six, is ten of damage.\nLIAM: Then the keen dagger follows. That is a 27.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That hits for ten damage, and then–\nLAURA: You're killing them!\nLIAM: And then the flametongue dagger.","response":"DM: You're not Hasted anymore, by the way."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're right, forget it, yeah, forget that last. That's right, two.","response":"DM: So as you're off to the side hiding among the slowly burning webbing, you move around, huck both daggers. One strikes a spider right in the center of where its eyes are and it screeches for a second before it curls up, its legs kind of pulling into its torso. The other one begins to pull out of the net that Pike set, and as it does you throw the secondary dagger. It strikes it in its abdomen, and the blade retracts and returns to your belt, and as it does, it leaves this streak of greenish liquid. And you have a better view of these spiders now. Go ahead and make a nature check, both Keyleth and Vex."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Dope.\nORION: By the way, I'm here, but I'm also there.\nMARISHA: Natural 20.\n(yelling)","response":"DM: You're also there?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Cloak of Displacement.\nLAURA: Good, because I rolled an eight.","response":"DM: Oh."}
{"prompt":"ORION: There's like two of me.","response":"DM: You notice as most spider-like creatures go, you're used to like the darker, furry, wolf-spider types. These have a different color. Their physical bodies are more white and blue. Their coloration is mostly white but with a kind of bluish hue to it and their eyes are almost pink-white in color."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh.\nASHLEY: Because they live underground. There's no sunlight.","response":"DM: They're a very strange, different kind of spider."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I don't like this.\nMARISHA: Is that all I know, with my natural 20?\nLAURA: Oh.\nMARISHA: Hm.","response":"DM: You in your experience, you've heard of certain spiders that can travel through the planes rapidly."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Now damn plane spiders?\nTRAVIS: Maybe we don't have to kill it, maybe they just (pfft).\nMARISHA: Gotcha. Hey, guys, I think these are like magical bamf-ing spiders.\nORION: Oh.\nTALIESIN: Okay.\nSAM: Cool, bro, let's kill them.\nMARISHA: Yeah, let's kill them.\nTALIESIN: There's one spider that's not caught?\nLAURA: There's what, there's three spiders left?","response":"DM: Yes, one back here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 24 to hit?","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And let's do this. My first shot–\nSAM: Ka-pew!\nTALIESIN: That's depressing. Well, I get the bonus, so that's 18 points of damage.\nMARISHA: That's not too depressing.\nASHLEY: That's not depressing at all.\nTRAVIS: That's not depressing.\nTALIESIN: That's not too depressing. It's because I'm taking a negative five to hit.\nLAURA: Oh.\nTALIESIN: And that's– oh, that's not bad. I have new numbers. 16 to hit.","response":"DM: 16 does also hit, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Aha!","response":"DM: Same target?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Same target, with an added fire bonus. Three fire damage and 17 as well.\nTALIESIN: 17 plus three fire damage.\nASHLEY: That bonus is awesome.\nLAURA: He is so dead.","response":"DM: (gunshot noise) That spider gets splattered. You see there's a burst of flame and a (explosion noise) as its body is knocked in the air, torn asunder, and then consumed by the flame burst at the same time. You see what looks like a scattering of ash across the ground and the steps beneath it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It looks like flash paper?","response":"DM: Essentially, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And I duck back behind Grog.\nTRAVIS: Where are you going?\nLAURA: Oh, bamf-ing spiders.","response":"DM: (teleportation noise)"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, shit.","response":"DM: One is striking at you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Me?","response":"DM: That is a 21 to hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It hits me.","response":"DM: And against Percy, that is a 25."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh my god, that hits.\nTALIESIN: Ow!","response":"DM: And I need you both to make a constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"(groaning)\nTALIESIN: Oh, bugger.\nMARISHA: That can't be good.\nTALIESIN: 13 points of piercing damage?","response":"DM: Mm-hm."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: They poofed. Poofers.\nLAURA: 17? Oh, wait. 19.","response":"DM: 19 constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. (blows raspberry)\nMARISHA: Oh, no, Percy!\nTALIESIN: Rolled a one.","response":"DM: So as all of a sudden, the strange (teleportation noise) sound streaks behind you, you turn over your shoulder just in time to see the spiders pop out of seemingly nowhere and strike into you. The fangs sink into your side and you knock them off with your elbow."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (grunts in pain)","response":"DM: You feel the venom extract itself from the fangs, but just as you pull it out of the side, so it actually does not envenom your body. Percy, you're not so lucky. The venom pulses into the side of your shoulder."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (groans in pain)","response":"DM: And you feel this burning sensation ripple through your entire upper right torso. You take 21 points of poison damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, shit!\nLIAM: What was that number, again?\nALL: 21.\nSAM: He's fine, he's fine.\nMARISHA: Is that all it does, just poison him?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I am poisoned, though.","response":"DM: You are not considered poisoned. It's the damage that's poison."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, it's straight-up damage.\nMARISHA: Okay, that's not too bad.\nTALIESIN: It could be worse.","response":"DM: That ends their turn. Tiberius? You're still holding your turn, Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Mm-hm.\nMARISHA: I did take Protection From Poison.\nLAURA: I should cast that on us.\nMARISHA: If that's necessary.\nORION: So we're in a hallway, a stairwell?","response":"DM: Yes, it's a stairway heading down, essentially, right here, and then it evens out at the bottom point there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fighting on the stairs.\nORION: Is it like a big–","response":"DM: It's about 15 feet up to the ceiling. Ten, 15."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh. Very well. How many are left, two?","response":"DM: Two."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nORION: Obelisk of Stone.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Squishy spiders.\nORION: Yeah, these squishy spiders.","response":"DM: So as both the spiders are knocked off both Percy and Vex, you guys kind of rear back, ready to defend yourselves. Suddenly the stairwell shakes for a second and pillars of stone go (stone crushing noises) from underneath. Similar to the trap room you encountered earlier."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's it. 21.","response":"DM: 21? And what's the DC on your spell?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17.","response":"DM: 17? Both spiders get mashed pretty horribly into the ceiling. You see where the pillars are slammed into the ceiling permanently. You can see the legs kind of dangling out for a second and then slowly curl in towards where the edge of the stone pillars are at the ceiling."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Eat it.\nMARISHA: Are there any corpses that are more accessible than the one that got torched and the ones that are squished?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, are there any spider fangs we can put in the bag?\nMARISHA: Yeah, because I have that book that helps me do that now.\nTALIESIN: There's the one I shot.","response":"DM: You can, actually, there are– there's one that you shot. No, actually, the one that you killed is the one that burst into flame."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes, the one that burst into flame.","response":"DM: That one's not going to be salvageable. There's a few that you and Vex killed. Vex and Vax both just kind of wiped out a few of the spiders. Go ahead and make an herbalism roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh, I bet we can get some of that poison. Dip the arrows in it.\nMARISHA: What did the book do again, gave me a plus or an advantage? Did it give me an advantage on rolls or like a plus something?","response":"DM: I asked you to write that down. I will say advantage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, wait, you did ask me to write it down and I think I did.","response":"DM: Advantage or a bonus, which of the two is it?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, no, I didn't write it down, I just wrote that I have the books.","response":"DM: Ah. I don't remember what I did for that. I will say advantage. That's the easiest to remember."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's better. 24.","response":"DM: 24. You managed to extract two poison glands from one of the spiders. The other ones were too damaged beyond repair."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh.\nORION: Sweet.\nMARISHA: Two poison glands.","response":"DM: Two small venom glands."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Nice.\nMARISHA: I give them to the twins.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, we can just use them?","response":"DM: You don't know."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: She hands you two nasty-looking glands that are still wet with spider ichor."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I got this for you guys.\nLAURA: Oh, thank you, Keyleth.\nTRAVIS: Do you want me to hold onto them?\nLIAM: That's very… that's sweet. I love it.\nLAURA: Tiberius, would you happen to have a little glass vial or something I could put this in?\nORION: I think I have two left.\nLAURA: Oh!\nORION: I need to get more.\nTRAVIS: I have them.\nORION: Oh, here we go. (pop)\nLAURA: Thank you.\nTRAVIS: I'm like a Wal-Mart over here. You could have asked me, but that's cool.\nMARISHA: Your book helps.\nSAM: I'm ready to make my attack turn.\nSAM: I sheath my sword.","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A little help here, please? Would be nice.\nASHLEY: Yes.\nLAURA: Oh. Oh, wait, I thought you weren't poisoned– oh, you need healing because you are–\nASHLEY: What are you at?\nTALIESIN: I'm at 47.\nLAURA: Okay.\nASHLEY: Okay.\nSAM: Eh, you're fine. Suck it up.\nASHLEY: I guess we all need some– what's everybody else at?\nLIAM: Ah, that's what I was at after I healed myself with a handful of hit dice after getting crushed into the ceiling.\nLAURA: Yeah, but we took a short break and we're not doing that now.\nSAM: Use your hit dice, you'll be fine.\nTALIESIN: I could just use my– oh.\nASHLEY: Um, hold on.","response":"DM: Are you guys taking a short rest, is that what you're doing?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No.\nTRAVIS: No, no.\nMARISHA: No, we're good.\nASHLEY: Let me heal you up, Percy, hold on.\nLAURA: Can I ask a question while she's healing Percy?\nORION: We've taken a short rest already, right?\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nLAURA: The grappling arrow I used on the little halfling, I can get that back, right?","response":"DM: Yeah, you retrieved it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Just making sure.\nSAM: I'll continue on down the hallway.\nTRAVIS: I join him.","response":"DM: Keyleth, are you still using Pass Without a Trace?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No.\nLAURA: No?\nSAM: She had to break it to use Stoneskin.","response":"DM: It's a concentration spell, isn't it?"}

Nine.\nTRAVIS: I'm with you.\nSAM: (nasal voice) Nine.\nASHLEY: Nine, Percy.\nLIAM: I would like to continue to stealth ahead of the group and also continue checking for traps.\nSAM: We already went.\nTRAVIS: Scanlan's already ahead of you.\nLAURA: Sam already said it.\nLIAM: Oh, he is?","response":"DM: As you stealthily move along the side of the wall, Scanlan comes pattering down the stonework."}

You can see webbing scattered throughout the entirety of the stone room. It's about 60 feet up. There is very low light from the flickering sconces that are on the walls of this towards the base of the actual room. The building in the center, it looks almost like an ancient mausoleum structure, how it's placed in the center of the room. Closed stone doors. But what catches your eye is that the entirety of the structure seems to be crafted of the same platinum-like material as the container that you guys are carrying the horn in."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, wow.\nSAM: Oh, we made it.\nLAURA: Are there sapphires all over the walls in here, then?","response":"DM: Not the walls of the actual chamber itself, just this central building right there."}
{"prompt":"ORION: We're not stealing from this place.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a perception check, anyone who wishes to look for traps."}
{"prompt":"SAM: While we're out there, I'm going to check–\nLAURA: (gasps) Oh no, that was my big fancy one.\nORION: Nice. I'm going to check for any arcane stuff and I got–\nLIAM: 14.","response":"DM: 14 perception."}

{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.","response":"DM: Best you can gather, as far as the presence of any arcane in this room, the scrolling on the structure in front of you, there are elements of the scrolling that you can see are based in the arcane runes that are used for ritual inscribing, but there's nothing of any magic that you've ever been familiar with that is utilized in this structure. What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Really, really high. Eight.\nSAM: I moved in with Grog.\nTRAVIS: I move in as well.\nLIAM: I'm moving in.\nLAURA: Can I try to stealth and move alongside just kind of keep to the edge?\nASHLEY: Going in.\nTRAVIS: We're all going in.\nLIAM: Ditto, kiddo.\nORION: I'll keep close to the guards and the box.\nASHLEY: Yeah, I'll go in.\nLAURA: Okay, I rolled 18 on the stealth.\nASHLEY: I'll go in close to Grog.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nLIAM: I'm going to tail my sister, actually.\nLAURA: And Trinket's going to stay next to Keyleth.\nMARISHA: Come here, Trinket.","response":"DM: So they'll go back to this point."}

{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to go use Greater Invisibility, as well.\nSAM: Why greater?\nORION: Because I can cast and still stay invisible.\nLAURA: Before she touches anything, can I let her know that there's a whole lot of spiders on the other side of the room.","response":"DM: You may do that."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Perhaps we should deal with the spiders before we make noise, or maybe just be prepared. In fact, you know what?

You're a strong, smart person.\nASHLEY: While she's looking, could I–\nLAURA: Spike Growth!\nASHLEY: You found it.\nTALIESIN: Way more than arrows.\nLAURA: It is a 20-foot radius. That's not that much.","response":"DM: Okay, cool. So you can do this whole area right here is all spiky growth."}

{"prompt":"ORION: I'd like to walk up as I see this going on. I'm going to take out my deck of illusions. I'm going to toss two cards both ways, two cards on each side.

{"prompt":"ORION: I put two on each side.","response":"DM: Oh, two on each side."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah. So, like, two over in the spot before all that mess over there and two are in the other mess.\nASHLEY: Do you want to go one up top, just in case?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nORION: So the Jokers–","response":"DM: Are you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And a female version of me.\nLAURA: Ooh, that's awesome.\nORION: (falsetto) Hello, everyone.\nMARISHA: You know, you make a good woman.\nORION: (falsetto) Tiberiosa.","response":"DM: Female Tiberius appears over on that side."}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (falsetto) Levi-O-sa, not levio-SA.","response":"DM: A succubus appears over here. Winged."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well, that's fun.","response":"DM: Sorry, what was the other one that you said?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Queen of Hearts and a Ten of Hearts.","response":"DM: Ten of Hearts. A cloud giant on this side of the room."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What?\nORION: (explosion noise)\nASHLEY: Rad.","response":"DM: We'll use that mini for now, it's fine. All of a sudden appear, kind of translucent, their image flickering. It's not a great illusion, but it's enough where it catches some attention."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And they're positioned right before the messes of each side.","response":"DM: Like right there."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.\nSAM: No, no, do it.\nTALIESIN: Yes, yes, go.\nMARISHA: Okay, you're good. Go for it, yeah.","response":"DM: She puts her symbol into the recess. As it does, the stone doors shift and there's a dull kind of creaking of the stone as it slides not open, but into the walls, revealing an interior that is, as the light filters in, the entirety of the wall, floor, and ceiling of this room is of the same scrolling, the same platinum/sapphire material as the outside of the building and the box that's there, except for the design seems to all filter in towards the center, like the center of a spiderweb. All the design coalesces to the center point."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Had to be a spiderweb.","response":"DM: It's not an actual spiderweb. There's a raised dais up in the center there, about four feet wide, about a half-foot thick. Kima kind of takes her symbol and puts it back around her neck and kind of motions like this. The two Scalebearers begin to move down, carrying the case, looking about the rest of you like–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I invisibly follow right behind the box, still keeping my illusions in check.\nASHLEY: Same, same, same.","response":"DM: Everyone holds in place?"}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, if I held– let me shift one over, just so I'm not in Trinket's way. The other way. Yeah.\nTRAVIS and LAURA: Everybody?","response":"DM: No, Tiberius, with advantage, because you're invisible."}

{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I don't?","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17.\nASHLEY: Three.\nSAM: Clang, clang, clang.","response":"DM: So you step into the chamber, losing your footing for a moment on the smooth, kind of platinum-like ridges across the ground, and you kind of catch yourself, your plate hitting the ground with a loud (ting) sound, at which point the two Scalebearers kind of look at you–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (whispers) Sorry! Sorry!","response":"DM: With a heavy sigh, and Kima goes, “Go, go, go!” They both step forward and take and place the box into the center of the room on top of the dais. As they both release the chains, the box seems to levitate on its own to the center of the room, much like how the Horn itself ascended and was kept aloft in the center of the box. The box lifts up and slowly begins to rotate on its own. As it does, you can see the sapphire bits that are ingrained on this box flash with a bright blue light and all of a sudden the blue energy spreads into the ceiling and the floor of this room and all of the blue and silver veins that are carved into this begin to glow with a similar blue light."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Cool.\nMARISHA: Cool.\nORION: I love light.","response":"DM: At which point, the doors begin to–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Which doors?","response":"DM: The doors you guys entered this room through begin to close."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ah, we should leave.\nORION: I'm going to scootch.","response":"DM: Yeah, you guys immediately scootch out of the way. Kima darts off. Both of them turn around and start running back."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (whispers) They're going to die.","response":"DM: They both make it out."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh! That's good.","response":"DM: They both manage to just squeeze through real fast as the doors slam behind."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That would be terrifying.","response":"DM: At which point, you see a series of spiders beginning to try to cut around– these here, what's the DC on your–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: My spell?","response":"DM: Your spell, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 17, because I didn't do it through the hand cone.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispers) Why?\nMARISHA: Should we run?","response":"DM: Both of these spiders get disoriented and try to find their way through the Stinking Cloud, kind of like (choking, clicking noises)."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, who's going to be back down here, theoretically.\nORION: The guards could come back.","response":"DM: None of them make their way through. The rest of these begin coming forward– what's the roll they have to make for the Spiky Growth?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 14.\nTALIESIN: To repair the room that we broke, anyway.","response":"DM: 14. Both missed their save. What's the damage on that?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's 2d4 for every five feet crossed.","response":"DM: They would probably be skittering around here halfway through before they changed trajectory, so– 1d4, 2d4?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 2d4 for every five feet.","response":"DM: So 10d4 each."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Nice!","response":"DM: They come charging around the corner rapidly"}
{"prompt":"(skittering noises).\nMARISHA: 10d4? That's cool.\nORION: Oh, nice, what?\nMARISHA: For her thorns.\nORION: (whispers) Sweet, thorns.\nMARISHA: My little sister once fell into a rose bush.\nSAM: Good story.\nMARISHA: It was very painful.\nMARISHA: That sucks, too.\nORION: It was very painful. I was riding my bike. It sucked.\nLAURA: 22.","response":"DM: 22. Both of these spiders stop in place, looking severely messed up and damaged and just kind of hold their ground, looking very confused. You see, crawling up over the top of this structure, one large white and bluish spider that leaps up. As this is happening, you guys are noticing that blue energy is cracking through the floor and now following the pattern across the entirety of the structure. It crawls up the walls–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh.","response":"DM: – and that blue energy reaches to the ceiling and illuminates it. And what you missed when you entered the room is you can see, recessed into the ceiling of this room, four large humanoid entities that are just currently held aloft, buried in the ceiling, of platinum armor."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Go.\nTRAVIS: We've got to go. We've got to go.","response":"DM: One of them suddenly flashes, dislodges, and (whoosh, thud), squashing the spider in the process."}
{"prompt":"(yelling)\nMARISHA: What is that?","response":"DM: Just (spider screech, croak) screeching sound, the spider slowly tries to curl in place, the giant platinum golem now slamming on top and squishing on top. You see as it slowly comes to stand, each hand holding these giant platinum cleavers. You suddenly hear a voice ringing through your heads collectively: “Get out.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispers) We should get out!\nORION: You heard the man! You heard him! You heard him! The earrings, everybody heard him.\nSAM: Wait, can we just leave the thing here with the golem?\nLAURA: Golems are meant to protect.\nORION: It's going to kill everything there.\nSAM: Oh, then let's go.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Okay. Yeah, sure.\nORION: 13.\nTRAVIS: What about on a ten?\nMARISHA: No.","response":"DM: Lower than a ten?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: (quietly) We all got above ten?\nASHLEY: 14.","response":"DM: Awesome."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Even Pike!","response":"DM: You guys all come darting out of the room, except for Kima, who rolls a one. So all of you guys come running out of the room–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Kima's dead.\nMARISHA: Kima?","response":"DM: The rest of the Scalebearers come rushing out, they're no longer encumbered by the box. Kima's kind of helping everyone get by, trying to keep everyone at bay, being the hero. As she turns around, the first one comes leaping off of the structure, runs towards her and gives one giant sweep with one of its blades. Ooh, yeah, that'll hit. You see the blade streak across the front of her silver armor. She takes 24 points of slashing damage. It sends her flying back ten feet with the sheer force of it, but she manages to roll out of it, yeah! With an acrobatics check, catching herself to her feet and just keeps bolting behind the rest of you guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I see?","response":"DM: You now see behind two more (crash, crash) dislodging from the ceiling as the one that's charging after you is coming up the stairway. Through this, we're now going into a skill challenge as you guys are rushing out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, god.\nTRAVIS: Must go faster. Must go faster.\nSAM: Skill challenge.\nMARISHA: Skill challenge!\nASHLEY: Ah, go, go!\nMARISHA: We haven't done this in a while.","response":"DM: Now, as you're running to get through, there's still bits of webbing still in the way. I need everyone to go ahead and make another dexterity check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes!\nTALIESIN: Yeah!\nMARISHA: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, sure.\nORION: 21!\nLAURA: 25.\nTALIESIN: 22.\nTRAVIS: 21.\nLIAM: 26.\nASHLEY: 17?\nMARISHA: 11?\nTALIESIN: 22.\nSAM: 19.\nSAM: Oh, no!","response":"DM: She runs past, leans back to reach her hand out as the golem comes up behind–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No!","response":"DM: – with two hands, swings down with both blades."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Against Kima again?","response":"DM: No, this is against one of the Scalebearers."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, okay.\nTALIESIN: Oh no.\nLAURA: Should I be rolling for Trinket?","response":"DM: I'm considering Trinket with you, so no."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Too late, just leave them.\nLAURA: Okay, thank you.","response":"DM: We'll do that next round because I forgot. There's a lot of things to consider. One of them hits the stone and just streaks off, sparks flying through the air, illuminating the space secondarily. However, the other Scalebearer takes 28 points of slashing damage from the blow. As it reaches up again for a second blow, Kima reaches down and grabs Desona's arm and lifts her up off her feet and they both go charging forward. You guys make your way up the stairway as you see now the golem pushing its way through."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to dissipate my card illusion and I'm going to cast Fly on myself, so I'm hovering.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How much of a gap is there between the last trailing-behind Scalebearer and the golem?","response":"DM: Well, now that Kima's got them, they're rushing up and there's about a ten-foot, 15-foot gap now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nMARISHA: I'm going to turn around and do Wall of Stone. Boof!","response":"DM: Okay. As they rush past, a wall of stone slams up as the golem goes smashing into it–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'll do support. I'll do Obelisk right behind it, too.\nMARISHA: Boof!\nMARISHA: Right, run.","response":"DM: As well as the following of additional giant heavy footsteps. It's now got its reinforcements caught up to it. You guys charge into the room with the broken trap, which now has partially raised platforms. You're rushing around and trying to find your way through. You get to the other side of the room. There's now an entirety– a room filled with mist in front of you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) Oh no.\nMARISHA: I still have it. I can Gust of Wind. That's my last 3rd-level spell.\nMARISHA: Including me?","response":"DM: Everyone."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wisdom check or saving throw?","response":"DM: This is a wisdom check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just adding your wisdom?\nASHLEY: Natural 20!\nLAURA: What what!","response":"DM: Nice!"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 24.\nMARISHA: Saving throw or just your ability modifier?\nORION: 12.","response":"DM: Ability modifier."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh.\nMARISHA: Okay, 16.\nORION: I thought it was negative three.\nSAM: Ten. Ten for me.\nTALIESIN: 14.\nLAURA: 13.\nLIAM: Nine.\nTRAVIS: Two.\nSAM: Nine, wow.","response":"DM: All of you guys are pushing through. So, as you guys come rushing in you're like, go go! You see Keyleth's focusing and getting the wind to escape, Keyleth rushes up, Kima comes through with the two Scalebearers, everyone comes through, Grog's bringing up the back. You can see now, in the back behind him, a giant blade-wielding fist as the golem comes smashing through the wall. The rest of you guys, ushering Grog along, Grog comes running, hears the sound, looks over his shoulder and in the chaos of it, his trajectory is off and he ends up brushing into the side of the mist."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, no!","response":"DM: Grog, go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 12.","response":"DM: You end up taking 24 points of fire damage as the pillars spin, unleashing a torrent of flame."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, bad car wash, bad car wash!\nLAURA: Oh, no, Grog, your beard has been singed.\nORION: Oh!\nTRAVIS: What?","response":"DM: You reach up instinctively, you feel it's as smooth as a baby goliath's face."}
{"prompt":"ORION: All that work!","response":"DM: As you guys charge up the rest of the staircase–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is Grog behind us now, like the furthest away?","response":"DM: He's just caught up to you guys as you're rushing up the staircase. You get to the final door. You exit. As Kima rushes everyone through, she brings out her holy symbol real fast, and as she pulls it off her neck, you see the first golem reach the bottom of the staircase. It begins looming up–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: We're leaving! What are you doing?!\nMARISHA: Yeah, go home! Go home! Bad golem.\nTALIESIN: I take a–","response":"DM: Kima takes out her holy symbol and holds it aloft in front of her and says under her breath (murmurs), at which point it begins to glow with this extremely vibrant glow. As it does, you see a symbol emblazoned on the front of the golem and it flashes with light as it stops and just kind of holds its place– and waits. And Kima looks at the symbol like “I wasn't sure that was going to work.” She takes–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Tell it to go kill the spider.","response":"DM: She takes the symbol and puts it back in the side of the stone door that originally was closed. The doors slowly seal shut once again. She pulls the symbol out– and she falls to her knees, breathing heavily."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, Kima.\nMARISHA: We did it!\nTRAVIS: Next time, lead with that.\nORION: I agree, Grog. Very well said.","response":"DM: “It kind of happened very quickly, I'm sorry.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, dear.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nSAM: Kima, for sure.\nORION: I'm actually okay.\nTALIESIN: I'm fine.\nSAM: Oh, Grog's got a burnt face.\nTRAVIS: No, I want to wear this pain as a remembrance of my beard.\nLAURA: You can grow it back, Grog.\nORION: It's okay, big fella.","response":"DM: You make your way back up to the main chamber, where High Bearer Vord is currently waiting for you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, this guy.","response":"DM: He turns to you as you enter. “So I am to assume that your journey was a success?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, surprisingly so. It went off without a hitch. Well, no.\nLAURA: You've got some good security down there.\nMARISHA: Very good.","response":"DM: “I told you. Once it's instilled, it will be safe.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: A little warning next time would be great.\nASHLEY: 25 points of healing.","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"ORION: You're really a girl on fire now.\nMARISHA: That really heals me up, then.\nTALIESIN: That will top me off very nicely.\nMARISHA: I'll take that.\nORION: Well done, everyone, by the way.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: That could've gone worse.\nMARISHA: It could have gone worse.","response":"DM: At which point, the High Bearer Vord kind of raises his hand. “Yonn, if you do not mind.” And Yonn kind of shuffles forward."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yonn.\nORION: Such a bore.\nMARISHA: Yawn.","response":"DM: “Excuse me, I'm right here.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: It was a play on words. Your name also means something that you do when you're tired.\nMARISHA: Yeah!","response":"DM: “I don't like you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! I'll hold onto that.\nORION: Of course.\nTALIESIN: We should mention, you may have to have one of the rooms repaired.\nORION: I take a couple out.\nTALIESIN: The spinning column–\nSAM: Circle of death.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: May have gotten–\nLAURA: A little broken. We thought were maybe just disarming it but I think we probably broke it.\nTALIESIN: We put an arrow into it.\nTRAVIS: (tearfully) If you find the remnants of a glorious beard, preserve it.\nLAURA: Oh, Grog, actually–\nTRAVIS: What?\nLAURA: I've got some remnants of a lovely beard. And I try to smush it onto his chin.\nTRAVIS: It is not the same.","response":"DM: It is not the same."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It looks pretty good.","response":"DM: It is not the same."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Dang it.","response":"DM: At which point, the High Bearer turns to you, Pike. “Mighty cleric, I see this meeting, though it escaped my vision before, that you bear the holy sigil of the Dawnflower, the Lady of Redemption Herself. While we may walk under different stars, I offer these words that caught my ear naught but a week ago. In an excavation beneath the toppled tower of Syrac, the long-cursed ruin that sat like a blemish upon this city for hundreds of years, it was revealed that perhaps the five holy paths that began here at Vasselheim, there may indeed now be a sixth.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What?","response":"DM: “A forgotten temple to Sarenrae has been uncovered. Crumbled, lost, and without light, it sat, forever and a day, and few are around in this city of her guiding flame to recover and restore its glory. Perhaps you should look into it.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I will gladly look into it.","response":"DM: “The ruin lies to the west of here, at the base of the city's mountain. Look for the dark stone ruin. Nevertheless, I thank you for your time. Kima, if you wouldn't mind, we have some things to discuss as well.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, quick, Vorg–","response":"DM: “Vord. High Bearer Vord.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Vord.\nTALIESIN: Vord.\nLAURA: Highbearer Vord.","response":"DM: “Was that so hard? Yes?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Vord? You wouldn't have happened to hear of maybe a druid tribe called the Fire Ashari? They call their little hometown Pyrah. Do you happen to know, maybe?","response":"DM: He gives you a keen look and says, “There has been talk of a rogue band of druids, not more than two day's travel, in the– let's see, where did I put the maps here?” He thinks to himself for a moment, considering it. “Towards the Sunder Peak Mountain Range. Dangerous territory, fraught with volcanic activity. Yet these folks seem to call it home.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is Sunder Peak like west or east to where we–","response":"DM: “Southwest of the city. It's hard to miss.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Southwest.","response":"DM: “Look for the plumes of sulfurous smoke.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is the temple to Sarenrae on the way to the–","response":"DM: “The temple to Sarenrae is on the same mountain that this temple is built on.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: “To the west of here. Follow the mountain base.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh. So we can stop there first?\nORION: Yes, it's close, it seems.\nLAURA: All of us can–\nORION: Before we part, you seem to be quite learned about many things that I am not. Have you ever heard of anything called the God's Hammer or the Pale Stone? Or any particular artifact, Ropes of Mercy, perhaps?","response":"DM: “I can't say I have, unfortunately.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Of course.","response":"DM: “But I shall keep this in mind, should the information come my way.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Thank you. I bow.","response":"DM: He gives you a look, a quick glance, and notes: “For the record, while your color is not what it was when you first entered, know that the great Platinum Dragon sees through this guise to the heart beneath.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, thank you for noticing. I agree with the same sentiment. And I bow in the Draconic fashion.","response":"DM: “Well, Kima. Business. Thank you all very much.” And he kind of lends his hands out. As he extends his hand, the doors on the opposite side of the room open up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Magic. Thought it was banned.\nLAURA: (whispers) Wow, Pike.\nASHLEY: (whispers) Wow.\nSAM: So, when you've fully excavated it, you can come back and check it out.\nASHLEY: Yes…\nORION: Or you can stay here and restore it.","response":"DM: At which point, the older woman sees you guys walk down and says, “Please! There's nothing to take. Nothing but history and rock, I guarantee you. Bandits are not welcome here.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: No no no! I take out my symbol and I say, no no no, I'm here to help.","response":"DM: You can hear an audible gasp from her. She says, “My eyes don't deceive. Oh my, I am sorry. My name is Gesyra, a simple painter, but one of, as far as I know, the three devoted to the Lady of the Everlight here in Vasselheim. And now a fourth. I don't know where you came from, but would you stay with us for a bit and help us rebuild? Bring her name into the light amongst the others here in Vasselheim? Restore it to its glory?”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (tearfully) Yes. Oh, man, I don't want to leave you guys.","response":"DM: “It shouldn't take long, especially with your help. And we can bring the light into the heart of others.” And you can see the two other kind of joined her at the side and they all look at you with this look of hope that you can probably tell from the crinkles in their face they haven't had in quite some time. And they look up to you in their simple clothes as the first true strong bastion for Sarenrae that they've seen in a long time. With that, Pike, you get to turn to the rest of the group."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Well, I think this is a pilgrimage I have to take. So, Vox Machina, keep your eyes out. I will contact you every once in a while if I can, and we will meet up once this is completed. All in.\nTRAVIS: Right.\nASHLEY: Vox Machina on three. One, two, three.\nALL: Vox Machina.\nORION: (tearfully) You will be missed very much, Pike.\nASHLEY: I'm going to miss you guys very much.","response":"DM: And on that note, we have to close because people are in a rush. Yeah, Ashley will be leaving us for a time. She's going to New York for a few months to shoot a web– a television series."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A little web series.","response":"DM: A wonderful television series she has recurring. We're really happy and proud of her– we're just a jumble of emotions under the circumstances."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: You guys have been so amazing and have made this experience even better for us, and thank you so much for going with us on our journey. It will keep going, but I will be back when I can.\nORION: You will be back.\nLAURA: You'll be back.\nTALIESIN: You'll be back.\nORION: She will be back.\nASHLEY: But it might be a long time.","response":"DM: Yeah, she'll pop in and out if she can, and there will eventually be a return of Pike, but for the time being she feels the calling to stay and help rebuild this temple of Sarenrae."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We're going to miss you, Pike.\nASHLEY: I'm going to miss you guys.\nMARISHA: But we understand personal journeys.\nASHLEY: Personal journey.\nTRAVIS: You have a good time.\nASHLEY: I will.\nSAM: Pike, I, Scanlan, will not physically wait for you, but emotionally–\nSAM: Emotionally I will wait for you, and I will not stray emotionally. I will always be there for you emotionally.\nASHLEY: Okay, Scanlan.\nSAM: But physically, I mean, come on, it's going to be months.","response":"DM: Thank you so much, Ash. We're going to miss you but we'll tabs and we'll have you back soon."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Good going, Ashley!","response":"DM: And we'll see you guys at Comic-Con next week. Those that'll be at Anime Expo, I'll be there tomorrow for a couple of panels."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Buy those shirts!\nSAM: Oh, yeah, buy the shirts.","response":"DM: Six more days for the Critical Role shirts before they go away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hey, it's still got Pike on it, you gotta get it now.\nALL: Yeah.\nSAM: Collector's edition.\nASHLEY: Definitely limited edition.\nORION: See us at Comic-Con.\nMARISHA: We'll see you at Comic-Con.\nLAURA: Feel better?\nTALIESIN: We'll see if I feel better.\nMARISHA: No, it does. The energy feels better.\nTALIESIN: No, feeling better.\nLIAM: If there's one place to use the flamethrower, I think it's on that.\nTALIESIN: It's right there. Salt the earth.\nLAURA: No, like you're not so much right there.\nLIAM: I was being facetious; I didn't see it. I'm so comforted that it's on your wrist right now.","response":"DM: That's okay, we'll look for it later. I think we may be down one Scanlan tonight; unfortunately, Sam couldn't make it. So we will be missing our gnome bard for the evening. I know, he's got family stuff planned tonight. Ohana means family in a language that doesn't exist in this world. That's okay. The party had unknowingly broken the law of Vasselheim and as such, found themselves in a conundrum where they had to choose either to go to the seat of judgment and be judged for breaking the law, or they could join the Slayer's Take, which is a guild of monster hunters in the town, which they caused this infraction towards. They agreed to instead join the guild. However, in doing so, they had to undergo a trial. The trial involved the party being split into two different groups and set on a journey to hunt a specific creature for each group, along with a couple of newcomers. So we had our couple guest episodes for each group, separate to do their own little venturing. Everybody survived, which was good."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Not everybody.\nMATT and LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: We'll get to that. We will be coming back to the game in just a moment. Real fast, Travis, you should show us the really cool little thing that you–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: For my birthday, I got this. This is really great and heavy.\nORION: If it was sharp, it would be a functional weapon.\nLAURA: It is a functional weapon without sharpening.","response":"DM: So between that and Orion's wrist-mounted fireball launcher, we are covering all the bases."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We have Liam's daggers. Laura's gotten a bow.\nLAURA: I have; I can't wait to shoot.\nTRAVIS: Matt got a cloak.","response":"DM: I did get a cloak. We're slowly being converted by you guys into our respective roles."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I think the one that I'm the most nervous about receiving in the mail is necrotic.\nLIAM: Somewhere, there's a guy working in a morgue going, “Oh!”\nTALIESIN: That's coming to my house. It's going to my house, right there.\nMARISHA: Do you guys want to get it?\nLIAM: I got it!","response":"DM: You open the door. Waiting there, you see Mertin standing there and his red, scruffy, scarred-up halfling self with a sly grin, as he looks over his shoulder. “It's good to see you! I am pleasured to give you information that the rest of your allies have returned and you are requested immediately in the foyer area of the Guildhall.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I just run past him.\nORION: Really, they're alive?","response":"DM: “From what I can tell, at least most of them. I wasn't counting to be honest, but I–” The rest of you push past, rushing down the main other hallway that opens up into the main foyer area. You can see the hanging iron chandeliers are shifting slightly from the impact of the door slam. As you immediately peer around the side, you can see before you Vex, Grog, Percy, and Scanlan, all there, with little Trinket in the back, looking a little chilled. They look a little worse for wear, but definitively alive, as they have just received their payment for their Slayer's Take trial contract."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I run up to Vex and I give her a big hug.\nMARISHA: I run up to Percy.\nTALIESIN: Ow, ow!\nTRAVIS: I hold out my arms for Vax.\nTALIESIN: (pained) No, it's very nice to see you too, ow.\nTRAVIS: Everybody else is getting a fucking hug.\nLIAM: I'm walking very cautiously. Hey, come here, big guy.\nTRAVIS: Yeah! And I just squeeze him in, rub him amongst my breasts.\nLIAM: You smell like, ugh.","response":"DM: Scanlan stands there with his arms open. “If only she was here…”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I've been drinking a lot of water.\nLIAM: Come here, you. Tousle.\nLAURA: He almost died! How did you do?\nLIAM: I don't think we almost– (softly) Hi.\nTRAVIS: Oh, for fuck's sake.\nORION: As they're hugging, I go to Grog and I– how big are you? I have missed you too. I had no idea how much I would miss both of you.\nMARISHA: I'm so glad you guys are alive.\nORION: Where's Percy? Oh there he is!\nTALIESIN: Ow!","response":"DM: During this extremely awkward massaging, teat-milking process–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I was hugging!","response":"DM: A loud triple hand clap breaks the momentary gushy sharing of positive energy. Looking across the way you can see sitting on the corner of the main central cleric desk is Huntmaster Vanessa with her hands in the air. “Very well, I am glad to see that you have all survived. It is, I cannot say not heart-warming to see you all enjoying the reunion so well, although I had a very big breakfast and would prefer if this were to stop immediately. You have all proven to be very worthy of joining this esteemed guild. I am pleased to have such talent amongst our ranks because of it. Now, if you could please follow me, I shall reveal to you one of our great secrets. One you must keep.” And with that intensity you see the general white color of her eyes flashes yellow for a second. “The time has come to brand you as new members. Please to be following me.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Please to be following you.\nTRAVIS: Did she say brand?","response":"DM: She turns around. Mertin joins her side and the two begin walking towards the back side of the foyer, towards the hallway that was on the left side of the back area. You guys continue to follow them down a long hallway that is just door after door after door on both sides. Just closed, seems like almost a good ten or so doors on each side of this doorway as you progress. You do manage to come across one door that is open and it leads into a darkened training area where you see two Slayer's Take members are currently in the process of training with two training dummies in this dirt sandpit area. As you guys walk past, they stop and look over their shoulders and give you a nod as you continue past. You get to the very end of this darkened hallway, where you see before you a very intimidatingly large solid iron door. No hinges, just a large slab of iron with bolts into it. Flanking it are two very well armed and armored members of the guild. Burly humans with heavily tattooed skin. From what you can see, each one of them, their shoulder exposed, you can see the same marking into it. The Slayer's Take mark comes across as almost like a scarred brand in that type of shape and design."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and MARISHA: That's cool.\nLAURA: We're going to have very skilled people branding us, I'm sure.\nTALIESIN: Does that mean they're not skilled?","response":"DM: At this point, the two gentlemen standing either side of the door stand up and give a small bow to the Huntmaster."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do we get to choose where we get branded?","response":"DM: At this point, after hearing this loud metallic tensing sound as the two guys have now grabbed these wheels that are bolted into the sides of the door and are winching them down. And you can see as they are pulling, you can hear the sound of chains grinding and growing tense. And the iron door (metal and stone scraping), slowly raises up, revealing a darkened hallway that descends down stairs, about 15 feet wide."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Perception?","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What could go wrong?\nLAURA: Let's use this one. Oh, that was great.\nORION: Has everybody realized, they want to burn things into us?\nLIAM: We've done worse things to each other.\nLAURA: Oh, even less. It's a nine, total.","response":"DM: Nine total. Good to know. That stairway looks pretty sturdy. That darkness looks pretty dark. Even with your darkvision."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20.\nTALIESIN: Can I use my passive perception?","response":"DM: Well, keeping that in mind. As you look inside, you can see there are torches bolted to the wall that give a very low ember light, and they are spaced out about every 20 feet or so."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Not enough. Light!\nLAURA: Oh, there we go.","response":"DM: Okay. As you cast Light, it brightens up the room for a second, the two guards wince to the side and Vanessa spins around and says, “Fool, put that out this instant!”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: But it's brighter! Oh, okay, sorry.\nTALIESIN: He had a point.\nTRAVIS: He's not wrong.","response":"DM: Her intense demeanor softens for a moment and she goes, “There is a process to this. I appreciate your patience.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We must be branded in the dark, Tiberius.","response":"DM: She turns around and continues down the stairs. Do you guys follow below?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm last.\nTRAVIS: I put Percy in front of me.\nORION: I saunter in.","response":"DM: Okay. What's the walking order in this?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: What's the order?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, what is the order? Who's anxious? You seem jazzed.\nLIAM: I'm in front.\nORION: I'll be right after Vex.\nMARISHA: I'll be after Tiberius.\nTRAVIS: I'm the caboose!\nTRAVIS: I don't think the caboose makes sense now!\nLIAM: Grog doesn't know that!","response":"DM: There we go. And Percy, you're where?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well, Grog says I'm right in front of him.\nTALIESIN: That wasn't me! It might've been me.\nMARISHA: It might've been me.","response":"DM: As you step into the chamber, what little bit of light there is begins to brighten as you enter the main area, and you can see before you what looks like a beautiful stone sanctuary in the center of this chamber, built of white limestone with gold-inlaid trim and designs. Strange sandstone, almost obelisks, that frame a large ziggurat-like platform that rises in the center of this chamber just standing there in the stillness. These little torches placed amongst the entire thing brighten as you step forward and frame the visual of this strange, ancient structure."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Pardon me, Vanessa. I thought you were just a band of hunters?","response":"DM: (shushing) “Do you trust me?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Not really, no.\nORION: I'm going to agree with the room. But you are nicer, which is different.\nTALIESIN: And we're locked in.","response":"DM: “Well, either you follow or you leave and we leave you to the machinations of the seat of judgment, and you can deal with the law of Vasselheim.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Let's do it!\nLIAM: We're here. We're with you.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we're on board.\nMARISHA: The law of Vasselheim, for not getting branded?\nLIAM: What are you looking at?\nLAURA: There's some weird stuff up high.\nLIAM: Like spider webs?\nLAURA: No, like eyeballs. Is it like eyeballs?","response":"DM: It's a single eye that is placed within a sickle-like curvature that has a handle to it. Almost like that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it moving?","response":"DM: No, it's just a carving in the stonework that resembles an eye."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, okay.\nLIAM: I don't see an eye.\nLAURA: It's that carving right there. looks like an eye. Does anybody know anything about anything that looks like eyes?","response":"DM: This would be more of a religion check for anybody who has–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Religion check?","response":"DM: Religion."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I try?","response":"DM: You can, you're welcome to make a–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Natural 20!","response":"DM: There you go. Start it off. The sage worked!"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (splutters)","response":"DM: Looking at it, you immediately get the thought that this symbol represents Ioun, which is the goddess of knowledge, prophecy, and skill. Not one of the heavily worshiped– you haven't seen really any bastion of worship of Ioun in the city yet. It's always been those main five. This is the first temple to Ioun you've seen since you've been here, and it's definitely been under here for quite some time. As you guys get to the very top of the structure, you can see before you, the top of the ziggurat-like platform is about 50 feet across on each side. In the center there is a small raised platform about five feet high, four feet high, almost like a table or altar of some kind that is circular in its shape, and partially embedded in this is a large, solid glass globe-like sphere that is probably a good three feet in diameter."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does it look like anything we've seen before?","response":"DM: Not anything you've seen before, per se. It's perfectly clear and it just sits there at rest."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is this where the burning happens?","response":"DM: Vanessa seems to have not paid attention to your phrase and just shouts up into the darkness and goes, “Osysa! Osysa, come! We have fresh blood for you!” At which point, a loud roar breaks through the darkness, shaking the interior of the chamber where dust and sand begins to settle from the ceiling, which had been waiting there for quite some time."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Was this in the fine print?\nMARISHA: Guys, I'm thinking this might be a cult?\nTRAVIS and LAURA: That was a really high squeak.\nMARISHA: I'm a little nervous!","response":"DM: At this point, suddenly there's a shift in movement from the shadows behind the ziggurat, and leaping up onto the platform before you guys, you see movement and fur and rippling muscle. What you see before you looks to be a giant lion-like body. (thud) Steps onto the top of the ziggurat. These giant, griffon-like wings (whoosh) flare out, and as the light cascades up, you can see now atop this lion body is a female-like human face wreathed with a mane of ashy-blonde hair. Jewelry wrapped around the neck and the shoulders. You see as it looks down, the eyes peering across all of you. No pupils, just a glowing straight sky-blue color."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Are you the one that's going to be doing the branding?\nTRAVIS: We return the bow. I return the bow.\nLAURA: I look at Grog, like what?\nTRAVIS: It's a fucking lion with wings!\nORION: I'll do the Draconic sort of–\nTRAVIS: You saw Harry Potter, the hippogriff will jack you up! Bow back!\nLAURA: I nod.","response":"DM: She acknowledges everyone's existence. And you see now, Huntmaster Vanessa is also in a very, very deep bow, and stands, giving you all this look of, don't do anything stupid. “I have been keeper of this temple for hundreds of years–”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: You don't look a day over 20!\nLIAM: Smooth.","response":"DM: There's a brief moment where she gives you this keen look, head to the side like a curious creature. “Interesting. Humor does not find its way to my chambers often enough these days.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's unfortunate.","response":"DM: “I appreciate your candor, dragonborn.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: She likes jokes!","response":"DM: “Now, we've built this into a tradition that you have all now come into. And at this moment, you will come to bear the mark and be known as our allies.” Her eyes suddenly flare up with an intense blue flame for a second. All of you, simultaneously, at that moment feel this sharp, sudden burning sensation in your right shoulder. You instinctively reach over and grab towards it."}
{"prompt":"(hissing)\nLAURA: It just happened?! Like that?","response":"DM: You reach over and pull, and there's no heat on the arm, but there is that burning pain. You go and you look under, pulling your armor to the side best you can and look. And there, over your right shoulder you can see this same brand that you saw adorning the shoulder of Vanessa when she exposed it earlier, as well as the two guards at the gate."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can you hold it up again?","response":"DM: It is now raised upon your skin, seemingly already healed. Like a long-healed burn or brand mark. And the pain slowly subsides into a dull sensation, but it is not a fresh burn. There is not any peeled skin. It looks like it maybe happened a few months ago, and yet there it is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Not going to lie, it looks pretty cool.\nORION: The design is nice.\nTALIESIN: I'd have liked some warning.\nLIAM: Join a few more clubs, and we're going to be all sleeved up.","response":"DM: “Now, I have been here building this place and this guild for some time, with the intent of helping rid the landscape of dangerous prey and helping those who are also aligned with the good of the realm to bring their more powerful enchantments and uses to light.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we insight check and see if she's telling the truth? 24.","response":"DM: 24! It would've been good if I remembered to bring my dice out. There we are. It's been a rushed– yeah. She appears to be forthright and honest. There is a force of personality to her that speaks beyond any sort of mortal you've encountered, and even the extraplanar entities you've discussed with, there seems to be a forthrightness in her speech. You don't feel there's any layer of deceit involved. She glances down at the glass sphere that's embedded in the altar, and as she looks down, what was once clear glass slowly begins to glow with the same white-blue light as her eyes. “It is here through this Heartglass that Ioun herself extends my vision to watch the world. From here, I can see where our quarry lies and lays rest. When contracts are brought to our attention, I can see if they can or cannot be hunted. I can see where the worlds flow between. I can watch over my mate, wherever far he may be. This gift came at a price to me, but the good I can do, that we can do, is far more important than my sacrifice.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How far does your vision fall?","response":"DM: “The limits fall to where will would be bent against what wishes to be seen. In person, I can peer through many veils, but the further I tread with my sight, the more barriers of those who wish not to be followed can keep me at bay. I've only tried to pierce through the Abyss once. That was a dire mistake. However, you have come to understand one of our great secrets. Keep this with you, carry the brands on your shoulders with pride, for you are now considered Chosen of Ioun, and myself. Welcome to the Slayer's Take.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I take this with great honor. Thank you.","response":"DM: She gives a nod to all of you. She now stands back up. The orb goes back to a dull clear glass. Turns around. (heavy footfalls) the tail (whoosh) swishing over your heads for a moment. The wings expand, and with a great leap, the creature disappears into the darkness. If you want to make an arcana check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Has the glass totally faded?","response":"DM: The glass has faded, yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'll take that. 24.","response":"DM: 24. You've heard of entities like this. This is a sphinx entity, specifically referred to as a gynosphinx."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What?!\nMARISHA: Dinosphinx?","response":"DM: Gynosphinx."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN and MARISHA: Gynosphinx.\nORION: Highly erotic.","response":"DM: You hear a snarl from the distant shadows. No."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm still trying to figure out his sexuality.\nTRAVIS: You didn't check for the bits?\nORION: I don't know.","response":"DM: A gynosphinx is a feminine sphinx entity that specializes in being able to peer past lies, to peer past magical veils. You can see how this altar, this sphere is an extension of that power, though even that has its limits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Good thing we didn't try to lie.","response":"DM: At which point Vanessa turns around to the rest of you. “Well, then. I think that went rather well, yes?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.\nLAURA: A little warning next time, Vanessa. Maybe.","response":"DM: “I like the element of surprise.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So question. The little blue flashy thing that happens with the eyes. Is that going to happen with us now, too?\nLAURA: Can she see through our eyes now?","response":"DM: She gives you a curious look. “I do not know.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: She's not going to be happy with what she sees through Scanlan's.","response":"DM: Scanlan's behind you going–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, I think she is. Very happy.\nTRAVIS: Scanlan is the Cinemax of this group.","response":"DM: Scanlan says, “Well, if she's been in here for 200 years unable to leave, she's going to be really happy with what I can offer.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Peer into the scatological.","response":"DM: “It's a whole array of experiences that I provide.” As he puts on his mustache. Vanessa then turns around and begins to step down the ziggurat. “Well, then. Shall I lead you back to the guild hall proper? You are welcome to do as you wish. You have been released, and I believe we have some funds to give to you, as you are now officially part of the hydra contract you originally broke.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yay! I like the way you talk, Vanessa.\nLIAM: I have some questions, though. What is this relationship, you and us, now? Are we obligated?","response":"DM: As you guys are walking back out of the chamber towards the stairway, she goes, “There is no requirement for you, you are but a member of the Slayer's Take. If you wish to come by, we have contracts available, and you can look about those if you wish to take up. If you feel you are capable of doing it, let us know. You will then be bound to that contract to complete it, but there is no requirement. There have only been a few occasions that we have called our members to arms outside of contract, and that is usually when there has been some sort of an outside– for lack of a better term, a force that wishes ill to our business. In which case, we protect our own. But that's only happened twice since the inception of this guild itself, so I would not worry. But we have work for you, should you need it. We have a place to stay, and beyond that you are welcome to travel as you see fit.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What are your allegiances? To yourselves, to the guild? Or to Vasselheim itself?","response":"DM: “We have many allegiances. Whatever makes for the best business, to be honest. To tell you this, we like to make money.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I respect that.","response":"DM: “We like to make sure that the city is protected from entities, creatures, beings that would threaten the otherwise defenseless members of this fine city.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Very noble.","response":"DM: “And we like to make money.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: About that money, you said you owed us some?\nORION: Mage Hand.\nLAURA: I thought I caught all three. I really tried.","response":"DM: You caught two and Tiberius drifted one down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How much is in that one?\nORION: I don't know.","response":"DM: You take a moment to count them all. Each pouch breaks down to roughly 630 gold each, if divided amongst the seven party members."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're a fast counter.","response":"DM: 630 each. Can someone note 630 for Scanlan, by the way."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 630 each, 630 for Scanlan, as he is not here to do it. Why, yes, Scanlan. I will take your share. Thank you. I noticed Vanessa has some cookies on her desk. Would somebody hand me one of Vanessa's cookies? Thank you.","response":"DM: “These cookies were sent to me as a fine gift from a friend of the guild. Sir Darin De Paul of Vasselheim's finest performance troupe.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: They set my nerves at rest.\nLAURA: So we have a home here. We have rooms here. We don't have to pay for lodging?","response":"DM: “Correct. You just stay wherever you like. Mind you, there are probably more comfortable lodgings, but you do not have to pay to stay here.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're staying here!\nTRAVIS: Are we free to go?","response":"DM: “Of course. I have no business at the moment.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You guys! We killed a dragon.\nLIAM: Killed a what?\nMARISHA: Yeah, they told us. Oh my god, we have so much to tell you guys.\nORION: We killed a rakshasa.\nTRAVIS: A what?\nMARISHA: That's what I said!\nTRAVIS: Wait, what's it called?\nORION: It's a rakshasa.\nLAURA: Does it do dances? I'm confused.\nORION: It had backward hands, so I do that because it's weird.\nMARISHA: Saying his name is very– you know.\nLAURA: Oh. So you killed something that was human-sized, then. Because we killed a dragon! A big white dragon.\nORION: He had a big tiger head.\nTRAVIS: He had a tiger head?\nORION: Yes, and he was an infernal demon and was going to threaten all of our lives.\nLIAM: Yeah, it wasn't a guy with a cat hat. He was a demon.\nORION: A dragon is terrible, as well.\nTALIESIN: No, that's impressive, too.\nLAURA: Giant big giants.\nORION: Giants and dragons?\nLAURA: Yes, we fought them both.\nTRAVIS: There's some messed-up shit out here.\nMARISHA: We went to a really high-end club and Vax and I pretended to be married.\nLAURA: Oh, you did?\nLIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: You did?\nTRAVIS: Pretended.\nLIAM: What? Girls like me! That's not hard to believe! I can sell that, right? Percival, back me up, please.\nTALIESIN: You, you strike me as married, yes.\nORION: I turned into a half-elf as well. I was very attractive.\nTRAVIS: You did what? Really?\nLAURA: I've always liked your human form, Tiberius. I thought it was very attractive.\nORION: It's very opposite of how I look.\nLIAM: I noticed– Percival.\nTALIESIN: Yes?\nLIAM: Your coat is all frayed and fucked up. What happened to your coat?\nTALIESIN: (stutters) Well, I may have–\nLAURA: Almost died. Percy, be honest.\nTALIESIN: Almost died.\nLIAM: The dragon breathed its fire on you?\nTALIESIN: Well, not fire actually, but ice.\nLIAM: Again?\nTALIESIN: Another ice dragon.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, Scanlan took a little beating as well, didn't you, Scanlan?","response":"DM: Which, he looks to you and goes, “And on that note, you're welcome to stay here. I'm going to go ahead and use my earnings to soothe this pained, bruised pelvic region.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (gasps) Tell them I'll be along shortly for therapy.","response":"DM: “Of course.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You're more married than him.\nLIAM: Scanlan. Lift from the legs.","response":"DM: “I shall.” And he scurries out the front door of the guild hall."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Did any of you take a beating, or was it just us?\nMARISHA: We actually had a cleric with us.\nLAURA: Oh, you did? We did not. What was he like? He? I'm assuming it was a he.\nORION: Yes, he goes by the name of Kashaw. He was a rather interesting fellow. And a surly dwarf, of course.\nTALIESIN: I've never met a dwarf that wasn't surly.\nTRAVIS: I like dwarves. Did he have an axe?\nLIAM: He did. He was a noble fellow. Having a bad day.\nTRAVIS: Having a bad day?\nLIAM: Yeah. The cleric was nice. He planted one on Keyleth.\nTRAVIS: Planted one what? Like a tree?\nLIAM: You want to explain it, druid?\nTRAVIS: Are you blushing?\nTALIESIN: She's blushing.\nLAURA: Keyleth. Lady Keyleth!\nMARISHA: You just got mad at me for pretend-marrying your brother, so.\nLAURA: Well, now that I know you're interested in some cleric, I don't care.\nMARISHA: I'm not interested–\nTRAVIS: Do you have a crush on Cashew?\nMARISHA: No?\nORION: See, how it worked is that he thought that she was really annoying, but really he was attracted to her.\nLAURA: Well, who wouldn't be, Keyleth? You are gorgeous.\nMARISHA: He was very nice.\nLAURA: I'm bummed we had two ladies with us.\nMARISHA: Oh, really?\nTRAVIS: Did you guys get anything I should put in the Bag of Holding? Any cool trinkets and bits?\nLAURA: Oh yeah. In fact, we should probably take the carpet back now that Grog has the Bag of Holding.\nTALIESIN: It was a shame we didn't have it. It would have come in so handy for our adventure.\nORION: Vax, you should tell your sister.\nMARISHA: That should come from you.\nLIAM: It's a funny story. It's really funny.\nMARISHA: Yeah, looking back it is. You know what actually, hang on, stop. Do we have any ale on us? We should have a drink real fast.\nTRAVIS: Oh, we always have ale! I pull out the cask and I pass around a little.\nMARISHA: It's going to make it so much funnier.\nLIAM: Well, there was this acid pit, right? And we all got on top of the carpet, like we do.\nLAURA: Yeah, fly over the acid pit.\nLIAM: And there were these giant magical sigils that borked the carpet. Which was fine. It was fine, because the thing started to go down–\nLAURA: Right, and then you pulled up, and you jumped–\nLIAM: I grabbed the carpet, and I jumped and put my own body, up to my fucking head, into the acid. Burned. Yeah, you see this? You see this little bit of gray? I held the carpet up, and then it's funny. We both sank together, and then the carpet went in the acid. But it was still okay. It wasn't completely destroyed.\nTRAVIS: I'm sorry, you said it went in the acid?\nLAURA: But then you saved it, and it was fine.\nLIAM: Just a little bit, but only completely. Tiberius–\nTALIESIN: This story will be great if we could see the carpet, I think.\nORION: I pull it out of my Bag of Holding.\nTALIESIN: Well, you cleaned it, and that's nice.\nTRAVIS: It looks fine.\nLAURA: It looks a little less… glowy, though.\nORION: It doesn't fly anymore.\nTRAVIS: I'm sorry, it doesn't fry anymore?\nLIAM: It's very comfortable to step upon, but it doesn't fly.\nMARISHA: It's going to make a gorgeous tapestry.\nORION: We need to re-enchant it, is what's going on.\nLAURA: (shouting) You lost the carpet?!\nMARISHA: We– the carpet we stole, to be fair.\nLAURA: The carpet–\nORION: It's okay. Again, it's not a big deal. We just have to re-enchant it. I'll find somebody powerful enough to do so.\nLAURA: It's okay. We'll just pool our funds together. You guys didn't spend any money during your mission, right? We can pool our funds together and maybe find somebody. You didn't spend any money?\nORION: No, we spent–\nLIAM: We're still alive?\nORION: I have a plan, though, Vex.\nTALIESIN: We slept in a tent! We slept in a tent in the woods with the loudest librarian on god's green earth!\nLAURA: You should have kissed her, Percy.\nTALIESIN: She talked in her sleep!\nTRAVIS: You got a kiss! I didn't get a kiss.\nMARISHA: Hey, I'd never been kissed before, okay?!\nLIAM: In our defense–\nTRAVIS: What the fuck just happened?\nMARISHA: What just happened?\nTALIESIN: This is what happens when you de-enchant the carpet.","response":"DM: At which point, there's a knock at the front of the guild hall."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: God, timing.\nLIAM: Is there a tavern anywhere nearby?\nASHLEY: Oh, hi! Hello.\nTRAVIS: How did you do that? Your ways are mysterious.\nMARISHA: How have you been? Oh my god. I think we've only been away for a week, but it feels like a year.\nASHLEY: Oh, you know. Here we are. Oh boy. It's so good to see you guys. I've been working on the temple, and some people are great there, and some aren't. It's been great. I'm just so glad to be back. I got a couple of days off, so I figured I needed to come hang out with the group.\nMARISHA: How did you find us here? How did you know to find us here, Pike?","response":"DM: Here's the circumstance with you, Pike. They reached a certain point in getting a lot of the temple, most of it uncovered. It's still not quite at the level you want it to be, and it'll take a few months to get into its full restoration. However, there is definitely a curse placed on the tower that was once built over the temple, which is why most people avoided it for so long and didn't realize there was something beneath it. The more you guys worked, the more and more you saw the curse was essentially undoing and corroding a lot of the work you guys were doing to restore it. The group had to pool their funds to hire a high priest of the Raven Queen to come in for the next week and cleanse the landscape of the curse that has basically prevented you guys from progressing in restoring the temple, so you have about a week to yourself."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm here for about a week.\nLAURA: What should we do?\nLIAM: Let's go to Kraghammer!\nLAURA: Do we have enough time?\nORION: We have to get the money from Kraghammer, right? Pike, by the way, did you notice any blue shit around?\nASHLEY: Yes!\nLIAM: Like holy shit.\nTRAVIS: Like holy shit, did you walk around going like, “Oh, holy shit!”\nASHLEY: We were doing a lot of dusting. You know, you have your little brush? And I came across some blue shit, and I was wondering what it was, so I just kept it there. I didn't clean it.\nLAURA: You didn't pick up blue shit?\nASHLEY: I just thought it was so fascinating. I had to leave it there.\nORION: Apparently, blue shit is charmed in these lands.\nLAURA: It's a very good blessing wherever it lands.\nLAURA: I'm sure she had gloves on. You had gloves on, right?\nASHLEY: I had gloves, just in case.\nLIAM: A blessing from Sarenrae.\nASHLEY: That's what I thought.\nLAURA: Well, what should we do?\nMARISHA: Well, once again, I don't want to leave, because I'm assuming we'll lose access. We don't have access to the airship for forever.\nLAURA: It's true. We should probably go see your family before we go to Kraghammer.\nORION: Well, wait a minute. Kraghammer is just getting our money and leaving, right?\nLAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.\nORION: Your family, is that closer?\nMARISHA: It's around the corner.\nTRAVIS: Should we visit the shop and get some potions?\nLAURA: Oh my gosh, do we need potions.\nORION: Yes, we need to item up.\nLAURA: Just go and buy some potions.\nORION: Yeah.\nLAURA: Wait, does the Slayer's Take have a nice stock of potions?\nLIAM: Or an employee discount?","response":"DM: You inquire with Mertin, and Mertin gives a moment of thought and goes, “To be honest, I'm pretty sure that we gave our current stock to a couple of teams throughout, including the one that went and fought the dragon.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, yes. Funny thing: we used them because it was a dragon. Do you have any more?","response":"DM: “At the moment, no. We have a few that are on order. Should be here in the next two, three days. So there's that. But–”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is there a bazaar with any shops we can go to?","response":"DM: “I mean, there is the bazaar north of the guild; you're welcome to check in that area, but most of our enchanted potions are exported. It's one of the many things that the city makes its money on, and to be perfectly honest, most of what you've seen throughout the world probably in some way, shape, or form came from us. We take a lot of pride in that. But you're welcome to ask around. Good to hear this.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: As we're doing the item stuff, I would like to stop at a blacksmith's shop.\nMARISHA: Did we want to go to a tavern, too? What time is it?","response":"DM: By the time this team has arrived, I'd say it's close to 2:00 in the afternoon."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, shop then tavern?\nLAURA: Is Zahra still in the Slayer's Take, or has she left?","response":"DM: No, Zahra has left already."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You guys really needed to meet her. Tiberius, you would've liked her a lot.\nTRAVIS: She had a tail.\nLAURA: She was red.\nORION: I love tails. Ooh, and that's my favorite color.

He can tell you.\nASHLEY: Merkin?\nLAURA: This guy.\nASHLEY: Oh, hi!","response":"DM: The halfling who's now standing there– the one who let you in that you didn't pay much attention to because you were more focused on seeing your friends."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Yay.\nLIAM: Look at these badass tattoos! Yeah, look at that.\nASHLEY: What is it?\nTRAVIS: It's a brand that we got from a giant sphincter.\nORION: No, sphinx. Sphinx.\nTRAVIS: Sphinx?\nORION: A sphincter is your butthole. Not who we fight, but when you go–\nTRAVIS: Boom-boom.\nLAURA: What should we do? You go find a blacksmith and we get some potions?\nLIAM: Welcome to the Critical Role comedy hour, folks. Make sure you hit the two-drink minimum before you leave.\nLAURA: Do you think maybe that you could maybe start out on a journey with us, and then head back if you need to get back to the temple?\nASHLEY: Yeah, I have some time. I think we should just hang out like old times just for a little bit.\nORION: Yes!\nLIAM: Keyleth will fly you back lickety-split, just like that, yeah.\nASHLEY: Should we take the carpet?\nLIAM: Oh.\nTRAVIS: Right. About that.\nLIAM: Vex broke the carpet.\nLAURA: (gasps) I did not!\nASHLEY: She would never do such a thing. She wouldn't do it. You're lying.\nLIAM: I tried to save it.\nASHLEY: Is it now just a rug?\nMARISHA: It's now just a very pretty rug.\nLAURA: Oh, Pike. Do you want to keep it at the temple?\nTRAVIS: I thought we were going to get it re-enchanted.\nASHLEY: You'll get it re-enchanted.\nMARISHA: I'm pretty sure it's a very expensive enchantment.\nASHLEY: I wonder if I could re-enchant it with the poo.\nLAURA: Just rub poo all over it?\nASHLEY: I don't know what it is!\nORION: Actually, Pike, now that you mention it, perhaps you could ask some divine blessing from Sarenrae. Make it a holy carpet instead.\nLAURA: Ooh!\nTRAVIS: You have been working in a temple.\nLAURA: It's true, you have some sort of thing where you do it with a spell where you can ask her to help us?\nMARISHA: You have a ten percent chance of succeeding, but it's awesome when it happens?\nLAURA: You should do it!","response":"DM: Up to you."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yes, why not?\nMARISHA: Yes, we take the carpet out.\nLAURA: Come on, Sarenrae.\nASHLEY: Okay. I don't have any dice.\nLAURA: Oh, look! Look at all these.","response":"DM: So if you're wishing to use your Divine Intervention, you roll two d10s, the percentile dice. Usually, you have one that has two digits and one that has one digit. Roll those together, and you're trying to roll under your level, so you're trying to roll an 11 or lower."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Combined of the two?\nTRAVIS: Roll one at a time.","response":"DM: Yeah, the first one is–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Six.","response":"DM: So that'd be a 60. Yeah. So as you roll out the carpet, you take a moment to hold on to your holy symbol. You sense that Sarenrae's there, but divine magic versus the initial arcane-based enchantment here? It's a little out of her realm and her focus is scattered at the moment."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm sorry. I'm just a little too excited to do this right now.\nORION: You were coming from work–\nASHLEY: Yeah, coming from work. Tired, the time change.\nMARISHA: I'm sure you're doing a lot with Sarenrae.\nASHLEY: We'll try it again later, maybe.\nTRAVIS: Should we go get some potions so we can heal up?","response":"DM: You can attempt it once a day."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, good. We can try it every day while you're with us for a week. That's seven times!","response":"DM: You don't quite know how the Divine Intervention's going to work, but you know that she may come and help you in some way."}

One actually goes ping! And it shoots off."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I caught it!\nTRAVIS: (gasps)\nASHLEY: No, don't blow it away!\nLIAM: Make a wish.\nLAURA: No, keep it, Pike! It'll be with you always.\nLIAM: Wish on the carpet– oh.\nTRAVIS: That's going in her Sarenrae. You watch it, motherfucker.\nTALIESIN: I could send him to the blacksmith I went to.\nORION: Along the way, I would also like to be looking out for any animal shopkeeps.","response":"DM: Animal?"}

That is nine.","response":"DM: So as you're walking along, nothing's really catching your eye. You do manage to go to the blacksmith that Percy sent you to. What are you seeking in particular?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: A dragonite, raven.\nTALIESIN: At the blacksmith's?\nORION: The blacksmith's? Oh. I think I can only do short swords and looking at a crossbow.\nLIAM: You know how to use a blade, Tiberius?\nORION: I do. Oh, quarterstaff. I think that's what I'm proficient in. So I'm going to, crossbow, quarterstaff, some darts.","response":"DM: Okay. Blacksmithing is more for construction. The blacksmith there says, “Well, I mean, I can certainly make some for you, but there's already plenty of ready-made ones over at the general store across the way.” And he points to a smaller building."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I would like a quarterstaff, though, with bladed ends. It is why I came to you, sir.\nORION: Wonderful.\nORION: Wonderful.","response":"DM: “You wanted a crossbow, you said. You want a heavy crossbow or–”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh. What do you prefer? I'm a sorcerer, so I've got to keep it light.","response":"DM: “Then you're probably going to go with a regular hand-crossbow. Go talk to that general \"store over there.” And he sends you across the way. You head over to the general store. You purchase, base price for a hand-crossbow is 75 gold pieces, so mark that off."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm walking over just to watch.\nORION: Cool.\nLIAM: You got a taste for the knocking-about, fighting that thing, didn't you?\nORION: I don't like being unarmed anymore. And darts.","response":"DM: You also have to manage to get your ammunition, as well."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, I need bolts. Bolts.\nLAURA: If you buy a lot, you can put them in your Bag of Holding. That's what I do. Speaking of, how's my supply in there? Is it pretty good, still?\nTRAVIS: Your supply of what?\nLAURA: My arrows in the Bag of Holding.\nTRAVIS: Oh. Yeah, they're all over the fucking place.\nORION: How much for 40 bolts?","response":"DM: 40 bolts, I'd say I put those– I'd say for 40, two gold. Bolts aren't too expensive. It's bulk bin."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, then a hundred.","response":"DM: There are only currently 80 available."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'll buy the whole lot.\nLIAM: I bought them for you.\nLIAM: That's more interesting than the bolts.\nLAURA: So wait, he kissed you or you kissed him?\nMARISHA: No, he kissed me.\nLAURA: He kissed you.\nASHLEY: You were kissed?\nLAURA: A cleric kissed her!\nASHLEY: (gasps)\nLAURA: Do you know who his deity was? Maybe Pike knows him!\nMARISHA: Oh, his name was Kashaw. Brother Kashaw. He was a cleric. But he wasn't a cleric to Sarenrae, he was actually a cleric to this demon goddess named Vesh.\nASHLEY: Oh!","response":"DM: You've never heard of Vesh."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I don't know who that is.\nASHLEY: I thought I did for two seconds, and then I was like, oh wait, no I don't.\nMARISHA: It was interesting.\nTRAVIS: Does Vesh have a lot of followers?\nTALIESIN: It's an old god; you've probably never heard of it.\nASHLEY: That's what I was thinking.\nMARISHA: Yes, no, apparently he's the only one. He's also married to her?\nLAURA: And he kissed you? Wait. A guy that's married to a god kissed you.\nTALIESIN: Oh, I see how this could work out poorly.\nASHLEY: What if she gets mad?\nMARISHA: I've thought about that a little bit, and then tried not to think about that a lot.\nLIAM: Tell her to get in line.\nTRAVIS: I don't like that face.","response":"DM: What? I'm just enjoying some water."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I shouldn't have even said anything.\nMARISHA: It was awesome, though. Then he just walked off into the sunset.\nLAURA: Was it good? It was a good kiss?\nMARISHA: (whispers) I've never been kissed before, so I don't know. It was really good. Made me tingly inside.\nASHLEY: Oh, that's a great feeling.\nMARISHA: Yeah. Very nice.","response":"DM: So while this is happening–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He's not listening. We're girl pow-wowing right now.\nASHLEY and MARISHA: Girl time.\nTALIESIN: We're shopping for potions.\nLIAM: What else do you need? It's all on me. If you hadn't stopped that shithead from leaving, I wouldn't have put a dagger in the back of his head, and we would've been looking over our shoulders for who knows how long, so everything's on me. Whatever you want, tell me. Not a carpet. I can't afford it.","response":"DM: There's no real potion shops. The construction of potions is not a ready thing. People don't manufacture them left and right; it's a time-consuming process, and a lot of them are exported, so finding them here is a little difficult, and they're usually part of other stores that sell it as part of their stock. You\nguys, before you journeyed out last time, cleaned out the hag."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, that's something else we have to tell you guys about!\nTRAVIS: Can I look around the street and see if there are any shady types lurking about.","response":"DM: Make an investigation check. Asking and looking around, no one seems particularly helpful."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Excuse me. I'm looking for potions. Can I get some service?","response":"DM: Grog, you come up to a gentleman. He's dressed in a fine velvet bright-red-and-maroon tunic, and he's carrying a small satchel at his side, and he's standing outside of a small tent and he's like, “Anyone? Come forth! I carry oddities of all kinds! If you wish to see what I have for sale, I'll be happy to sell them!” Turns and sees you. “Oh. You, sir! You look like you're in an inquiring mood.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What'd you call me?","response":"DM: “Sir. It's a respectful term.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What were you saying?","response":"DM: “I should probably go.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, wait, you said you have oddities.","response":"DM: “Yes. Strange things from around the lands. I have them sent in from all over the continents.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Go on, then. Like what?","response":"DM: “Like–” And he reaches into his pouch and pulls out this small jar that contains a liquid, and you can see something sort of floating in this liquid. It's a little bit cloudy. “This is the eye of a basilisk I procured from the distant north of Tal'Dorei.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We've already got one.\nTRAVIS: I think we have two.","response":"DM: “Well, then. What are you looking for?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Funny thing. I like to work out a lot, and I like to go lift boulders in the forest sometimes, so would you have anything that might give me a temporary increase to my already magnificent strength?","response":"DM: “Let me see.” And he rummages through this small tent on the side. You see it's more of a storage tent-slash-bedroom-slash-whatever it takes to set up shop really quickly. This guy's definitely a traveling solo merchant."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Like the dude in the beginning of Aladdin?","response":"DM: A little bit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Come close. Oh, too close! A little too close.","response":"DM: That, with a little more of a fake upper-crust, Renaissance-man visualization. He reaches back. You hear him rummaging through some glassware and he goes, “I actually have a few potions at my disposal here.” He dips under one of the nearby tents that has an overhang, to get out of the rain."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we hear this at all?","response":"DM: You guys are having girl talk right now. This is a little ways out of the way."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Welcome to Agrabah.","response":"DM: “I happen to have one such potion. In fact, I have on good authority, it will restore some of your own damaged internal, should you find yourself in a dangerous situation.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I like the scars that my damage situations leave behind. I'm not quite as interested in that. What else have you got?\nTALIESIN: (stutters)","response":"DM: You guys are off shopping elsewhere. You guys are probably together, though."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How much was that?","response":"DM: “This one would run you 500 gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is it a superior healing potion?","response":"DM: No, this one is a greater."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm not spending 500 gold on a greater healing potion.\nTRAVIS: Come on, pull a Vex. Get that number down.","response":"DM: “Very well. For you, sir, I perhaps have this.” He pulls out a vial that has a gray, sparkling, almost like it has an iron filing sediment inside this thick, syrupy liquid. It looks like it would taste awful."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Ironschlager.\nTALIESIN: Why do they not make that?\nTRAVIS: Because they'd put a lot of iron in it.\nTALIESIN: Some people need iron.\nTRAVIS: That's true.","response":"DM: “This, I've been told, has been crafted from and distilled from the blood of many a tyrant-like stone giant from the far off mountains of the hinterlands. This, when swallowed, should imbue you with the strength of a thousand men.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A thousand? That's just above, like, four?","response":"DM: “Sort of.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: How much?","response":"DM: “For this one? This, I'd say, would run you a simple 6,000 gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Whoa.\nTRAVIS: Not that I'm not a man of incredible wealth. Would you be interested in anything besides coin?","response":"DM: “Speaking of which do you offer?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well, I have this fancy bag myself. I happen to have parts of an umber hulk. Pieces of dragon, if you might be interested in that. I also have jewels and fancy robes, if you need a change.","response":"DM: “My robes are quite fancy enough, but thank you.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right. I have an orc head. And I reach into the Bag of Holding and pull out the orc head.","response":"DM: “Put that away. Please. No, it's spraying on the front of my vest.” Make a perception roll… No, I'm sorry, not perception, persuasion. Persuasion."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, that's actually plus one for persuasion. 13.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we do. We have 14 dragon teeth.\nLAURA: Don't tell him all the numbers.\nTRAVIS: You're not there. Four cups of blood. It's probably more like a gel right now. Several pounds of scales, and maybe a few claws. I'd have to look; there's so many.","response":"DM: “How about this? For direct trade, no coin exchange necessary: all 14 of your dragon's teeth, and perhaps two of those blood vials.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (whispering) What would Vex do?\nTRAVIS: How about–\nTALIESIN: (whispering) Thank you.\nTRAVIS: All of the dragon's teeth and three of the vials of blood?\nMARISHA: What?!\nTALIESIN: Ugh!\nTRAVIS: Done.\nTALIESIN: Ugh!","response":"DM: He accepts all of the dragon's teeth, three of the four vials of blood– you can mark those off the Bag of Holding."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're getting you a leash!\nTRAVIS: Vex will be so proud of me.\nTRAVIS: Goodbye.","response":"DM: All gone, but you currently now have in your possession one Potion of Stone Giant Strength."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Stone Giant Strength. Thank you.\nLIAM: You drive a hard bargain.\nTRAVIS: Can I find that in here?","response":"DM: No. When imbibed you essentially, your strength becomes equivalent to 23."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: One time. One big time.\nLAURA: One use, or is it multiple?","response":"DM: One hour."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: One hour, so my strength becomes 23.\nLAURA: Can he get multiple drinks out of it?","response":"DM: No, it's one use."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What happens if I were to just pinky in?\nTRAVIS: Give it a little number?\nASHLEY: Give it a little taste.","response":"DM: Your gums will get a little tingly for a while. Probably be a little hyper."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Would there be any result?","response":"DM: I don't know, do you want to try?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm going to wait and try it.\nTRAVIS: Does that change my modifier at all? When it goes up that much?","response":"DM: Oh yeah. Your modifier would become plus six is what it would be, a plus six modifier."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Cool.\nLIAM: Money well spent.","response":"DM: As you take it and you shake it around, you can see on the inside of that sparkling metallic– there's a small object floating around and looking inside, it looks like it's a clipping of a fingernail or a toenail of whatever giant the potion was brewed from. Like a tequila bottle worm."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's the part everybody wants.\nTALIESIN: So I've just been sitting here watching this, shocked?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Look what I got. Let's go join the others.","response":"DM: “Thank you for your patronage. Enjoy the rest of your stay here in Vasselheim I hope to do business with you again in the near future.” He turns around and closes the thing. He takes his satchel and he starts closing down his tent and putting things away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait, you fucking– track him down.\nLIAM: You've got no idea.","response":"DM: Closes everything down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do we see him? Are we walking up? Can we walk up as it's happening?\nTRAVIS: As she walks up, I grab Vex and I go, you will be so proud. I just haggled down this guy so well.\nLAURA: What guy?","response":"DM: As you point back and look, you can see now a cart is being wheeled away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I Hunter's Mark him!\nTRAVIS: Why? Why would you Hunter's Mark him?","response":"DM: What level?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What level what?","response":"DM: What level Hunter's Mark? Basic level?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We are in the middle of a city where people might not take unwarranted aggression well.\nLAURA: Level three Hunter's Mark.","response":"DM: He stops in his tracks and feels the rain that's falling in his palm now; it's soaking him a little bit. He has a bit of cloth over his head. He puts his hand out and feels the rain for a strange temperature change, and continues pushing the cart, pushes it through the mud, rolling up the rest of the thoroughfare and disappears into the city. But you have a pretty good idea of where he's going."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So anyway, I was working with him, and you always try and get more for our money, (haltingly) and I definitely got more for our– more– gave more money–\nLAURA: What did you do? See? I'm glad I Hunter's Marked him. What did you trade? What did you get?\nTRAVIS: Oh, I gave him tiny bits of dragon for this amazing flask of Stone Giant Strength.\nLAURA: What is wrong with all of you?!\nTALIESIN: I was upset about the carpet, and I wasn't– he's huge! What was I going to say?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, Percy got a vial of Greater Healing.\nTALIESIN: No, I didn't. It was expensive and– oh god.\nLAURA: I need a drink.\nTRAVIS: To the tavern?\nTALIESIN and MARISHA: To the tavern.","response":"DM: You guys eventually catch up. You acquire your staff over the next few hours or so as people are resting, having drinks and such. It acts as a regular quarterstaff, except you can choose whether you want it to do bludgeoning or slashing damage."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, cool.\nLIAM: I fall in step next to Vex and look at her for a second. What's burning your arse?\nLAURA: Everybody's breaking things, everybody's spending all our money.\nORION: We have 30,000 gold pieces waiting for us.\nLAURA: We don't have it now.\nASHLEY: 30,000 gold pieces from where?\nORION: From when we were in Kraghammer.\nASHLEY: Oh, you didn't collect them yet.\nTALIESIN: So it's credit, there's credit.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, it's just waiting for us. I mean, we're basically the richest people ever.\nLIAM: We still have a keep.\nLAURA: We do, we have a keep! We have a beautiful keep, with furniture, and servants.","response":"DM: As soon as you say servants, the barmaid who's coming over and filling up your drink goes, “We prefer barmaid, but thank you.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, excuse me! Oh, can we have a goblet of your strongest stank for this one?","response":"DM: She looks over at her."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She started before we got here. Just keep it coming. Thank you.\nTRAVIS: How much are they?","response":"DM: “For your strongest? Per glass, I'll put that at about–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't tell him the price of anything.","response":"DM: “Very well.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I lift up the cup and keep putting it in, and say, a round of the strongest on me. I've got that, as well.\nORION: I'll take a water.\nTRAVIS: Should've let me haggle that down. I would have got it to 19 gold.\nMARISHA: Hey, you're thinking about it the wrong way, Grog. It's the other way. You want to go down, not up.\nLAURA: I love you, guys.\nMARISHA, ORION, and ASHLEY: I love you, too.\nMARISHA: I missed you all so much.\nORION: Pike, if we're to just be roundabout and mill about today, is that what you wish, Pike? After our tavern? What would you care to do?\nMARISHA: Stay-cation.\nASHLEY: Well, wait. Where's Scanlan?\nMARISHA: He went to the park.\nLIAM: You know, he needed a little– it was really rough going, from what I hear anyway, and he needed a little therapy?\nASHLEY: Oh, he needed a massage?\nTRAVIS: I thought he was going to the house where they–\nORION: Lady favors.\nASHLEY: I get it.\nORION: Well, we could do whatever you wish. If you care to wish the keep, let's go back to the keep. We could easily get there and take an airship back, if we choose to.\nLIAM: We were also talking about visiting Keyleth's family. Can you get away long enough to–\nLAURA: Maybe start the trip with us?\nASHLEY: I think I can. And then, if I have to leave, at least I can maybe meet your family for a little bit.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, Never-Been-Kissed. How's that sound?\nLAURA: Are they your family, technically?\nMARISHA: They're our sister tribe. Because we all separated.\nLIAM: Tell us again. Sorry, explain it again.\nMARISHA: Essentially, about 900 years ago or so, roughly a thousand years ago, we were a nomadic people. And then there was some sort of great sundering– we're actually still not 100% sure; a lot of information was lost. And the elemental planes started bleeding with this plane, and oh, Vex is falling asleep.\nLIAM: Whoa. Hey, Stubby. Wake up.\nMARISHA: Anyway. Long story short, we separated into four separate tribes to protect the places where the elemental planes bleed into this realm. Once every generation, someone is nominated to go out and make contact with the sister tribes in order to establish further communication, check in, learn about each other's cultures.\nORION: Interesting.\nMARISHA: We're from the same people, but we each have our individual cultures because we've been separated for so long, at this point.\nLAURA: So these ones are Fire.\nMARISHA: These ones are Fire, yes, so they're located in a volcanic region, and you can start to feel an energy from where the planes start to shift, and it gets a little unbalanced. That's where we each live, and I'm from the ones where we protect the Air portals.\nORION: Lady Keyleth, did you just say where the planes shift?\nMARISHA: Yes, because where all the planes– almost like a Venn diagram, if you want to think about it.\nORION: Who is this, who is Van Diagram.\nMARISHA: (stuttering) Well, he was a great philosopher, of one of our peoples. But he described it as being these overlapping circles. What's that?\nASHLEY: He was one of the Ashari?\nMARISHA: He was.\nORION: Van Diagram was one of the Ashari.\nMARISHA: Very great man.\nORION: Quick question about the planes. Will we travel there, is there any way to, perhaps, get to the fey woods through these planes.\nMARISHA: We don't necessarily overlap with the fey. We protect where it overlaps. You could get to the fire elemental plane easier from this place, and my town you can get to the plane of Air–\nLAURA: (belches)\nMARISHA: That's a good one, Grog!\nTRAVIS: Nope. Not me.\nORION: That was Vex.\nASHLEY: That was a good one.\nLIAM: It's nappies time. Nappy time.\nMARISHA: Are you feeling okay, Vex?\nLIAM: Just give her an hour. She'll be fine.\nASHLEY: She just needs some time.\nLIAM: Side note: I'm two inches taller, and I've always called you Stubby.\nLAURA: Oh.\nLIAM: Come here, Stubby.\nMARISHA: But anyway, the last person to go on the Aramente was my mother, and she never returned, so we haven't really had contact with the Fire Ashari for a while.\nTRAVIS: So you're pretty anxious to go, then, yeah?\nMARISHA: I have no idea what they're going to be like.\nTRAVIS: But you know about where they are, right?\nMARISHA: I've gotten rough directions. We'll have to probably figure it out along the way.\nTRAVIS: Are we hoofing it? Are we flying?\nORION: We could do whatever you wish, Grog. Do you have a particular ability called Magic Weapon?\nASHLEY: Well, I have Spiritual Weapon. So I guess, yes?\nORION: They're different things.\nASHLEY: Well. What do you want? What are you looking for?\nORION: I wanted you to bless my quarterstaff. Make it magical. I need my staff enchanted. I would like you to enchant my staff, Pike.\nASHLEY and TRAVIS: Whoa!\nASHLEY: I know what that means.","response":"DM: You've been around Scanlan long enough."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The holy symbol goes (shattering sound).\nORION: I mean in a strictly platonic, arcane sense.","response":"DM: What little knowledge you have of enchanting items, from your experience, and you had this a little bit as well from your own enchanting: the process of enchanting a weapon into what would be considered a magical weapon is a weeks-long process. It's doable, definitely, but it's one of those things where you would have to have somebody sit down with it over a period of time, and daily instill it with that magical energy until it finds its permanence within the object."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is there anybody in town I could leave that with and pay to do that?","response":"DM: Probably?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: A mage?","response":"DM: Mage, maybe not so much. There are other clerics."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It'd be expensive, though. It's somebody's time for a week.\nMARISHA: It also seems like this is one of those towns where things are expensive. Things are expensive here.\nTRAVIS: Not if you know how to handle them.\nORION: Right. I'll hold off on that.","response":"DM: But yes, it is totally doable."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is it a thing that I can like start to do, hourly for a long, long time?","response":"DM: If you wanted to yourself, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, I'm going to start that process right now.\nLIAM: Here's what I think. Lady Keyleth has been talking about this for a long time. It's calling to her, and we're a family now, and it's her moment. We're here. They're right nearby. There's no use putting it off. Let's go to her family.\nMARISHA: I am so nervous, you guys. I'm so scared.\nLAURA: Let's go. Should we go in the morning, or should we go now? Let's go now.\nMARISHA: We'll go in the morning.\nORION: No, let's sleep it off.\nASHLEY: We'll take just a small nap.\nTRAVIS: I walk up behind Vex and I tap on her opposite shoulder and pull my hand away.\nLAURA: Who's there? Hi, Pike! I'm so glad you're here.","response":"DM: At which point the bartender at the tavern goes, “Are you sure about that?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, one more!\nASHLEY and MARISHA: One more!\nLAURA: I tip him five gold and I give him a wink.","response":"DM: He happily takes it, and the wink is a strong wink. He smiles back, but also gives you the look of like, time for bed. You all eventually finish your drinks and find your way back to your respective rooms for the evening and have a good night's rest. And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a five-minute restroom break on our end. We'll be back here about five minutes or so, so don't go too far, and we'll kick back in the following morning for what appears to be a journey towards the Pyrah tribe of the Ashari."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm so scared! I'm so nervous!\nTALIESIN: You're going to do great!","response":"DM: Hey guys, welcome back! We've had our break, so as the party comes to consciousness the following morning, a very heavy hangover coming from Vex for the evening of lamenting the loss of a number of financial things."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I whip her up a little herbal tonic. Here. Drink this.\nLIAM: I'm taking Trinket for a walk. For dookies.\nTRAVIS: Come on, you son of a bitch. Yes! Two, two! 22!","response":"DM: 22. As you come to consciousness, Grog wakes up and shakes his head for a minute, and you look, and there is a good solid two-inch beard. Where was once the somewhat clear, stringy, fishing-line-type scruff, you're starting to see a little color come into it. This thick black root is now starting to appear at the base of the beard."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is it like an Abe Lincoln beard, or do I also have a mustache?","response":"DM: Actually, for you it's only coming in as a chinstrap beard, at the moment."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, wow.\nTRAVIS: Don't judge.\nORION: I see Vex's condition and I run out to get her a coffee from the bazaar, and then do my perception check on the thing.","response":"DM: As you're glancing about and getting coffee for her, you manage to see a cart that's just setting up this early in the morning in the bazaar. You hear some squeaking and growling and a couple of bird chirps. You look over to the side and there is one small setup that has a number of creatures and small animals and stuff set up in cages."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! As I'm running by because the coffee's hot. Hot. Oh, excuse me, would you happen to have any particular dragonites for sale? Male, preferably, but I will take female if you have one. (quietly) I'm just making it hotter when I blow on it.\nTALIESIN: That's funny. It took a second.\nTRAVIS: What are dragonites?\nLAURA: Little baby dragons?\nLIAM: Like a pseudodragon.\nLAURA: You going to have a little pet, too?","response":"DM: Okay. She glances at the coffee in your hand, “Well, I mean, we've got two that are a bit sickly, but they're for purchase if you like.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I would love one. Give me whichever's the least sickly of the two.","response":"DM: “They're both green; it's hard to tell.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, I'll take the darker green one.","response":"DM: “Okay. That one's probably more sick, but I'll take it.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, very good.\nMARISHA: No, don't pay full price for a sick dragon!","response":"DM: “There you are, sir. Have a good day.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Thank you very much. Any particular tips, food-wise?","response":"DM: “Don't let it die. Feed it. Give it water. Good day, sir.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, so I run back and I go, oh, here you are.\nLAURA: Oh, thank you.\nASHLEY: Oh, who's that?\nMARISHA: What is that?\nORION: I think I'm going to name him Lockheed.\nLAURA: Trinket looks very interested in Lockheed.\nMARISHA: He looks a little– oh…","response":"DM: Trinket's nose goes up to the cage (sniffs)."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Is he sick?\nTALIESIN: I don't think it's supposed to make that noise.\nORION: Do you want to do some healing?\nASHLEY: Yeah, I'll do just a small healing.","response":"DM: Medicine check? Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Your bear shat like a fountain. Wasn't solid. I don't know what you're feeding him. It was a little runny, sorry. Roughage. He needs roughage.\nLAURA: Trinket, get some vegetables in your diet.","response":"DM: (groans, growls)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He likes meat, what can I say?\nASHLEY: What was I rolling for?\nTRAVIS: I missed Pike.\nASHLEY: Checking about the health. I rolled a seven.","response":"DM: He doesn't look the healthiest."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: He looks really sick!\nMARISHA: Can I check him out? Is he considered an animal?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I check him out?\nLIAM: Oh, but he's a little cutie, isn't he?\nTRAVIS: I like him. Can I put my finger in the cage?\nORION: Lockheed.\nMARISHA and LAURA: Lockheed.\nTRAVIS: I put my finger in the cage and go, hello, Lockheed!","response":"DM: As soon as your finger gets to the edge, (snaps) he bites on the finger."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He's a real peach.","response":"DM: You take a point of damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!\nASHLEY: Maybe you should name him Lockheed Peach.\nMARISHA: Aw, Lockheed Peach.\nORION: I think Lockheed is good enough.\nMARISHA: Can I do a check on him and see if I make him feel better?","response":"DM: Make a medicine check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Medicine check? Oh that's not bad. 19 total.","response":"DM: You gather this may be some sort of a general illness that lingers for a couple of weeks. Properly fed and taken care of, would probably be able to get it through its system."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I reach in my pouch and pull out a few Goodberries.","response":"DM: Okay. You feed him through the cage. Reluctant to eat the first piece. Eventually, it takes a bite and then begins to eat the rest through the cage as you continue through breakfast."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can you speak with animals, Keyleth?\nMARISHA: I can, but he's not an animal. He's a dragon-guy.\nASHLEY: Is he starting to look any better? Could I try healing him a little bit?","response":"DM: You can try healing. It's more of a disease-based illness."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just feed him, lots of water–\nTRAVIS: I have some dry food rations if you want to give him a nibble.\nMARISHA: I gave him some Goodberries. I'll make up some more Goodberries.\nORION: We have a bunch of food and stuff. We'll be fine. We can move on with the journey.\nLAURA: So, it's groggy, but we decided to go see your family, right? Right now?\nMARISHA: I mean, I don't want to inconvenience anyone.\nLAURA: We're going, Keyleth.\nASHLEY: We're doing it!\nTRAVIS: There's fire.\nLIAM: I've always wanted to see a volcano, anyway.\nTALIESIN: Yes, it sounds lovely.\nLAURA: I'm sure they're all as charming as you are.\nTRAVIS: You'll win them over.\nORION: You'll be fine.\nTALIESIN: What's the worst that could happen? Oh, never mind. That was rhetorical. Don't actually want to know what the worst that could happen would be.\nMARISHA: I have to do a trial and meet their headmaster.\nTRAVIS: Royal stuff.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: That's true.\nASHLEY: Yeah, you're going to do it.\nMARISHA: It's not even that. It's sometimes learning about your past can be equally as terrifying. I don't know what I'm going to find.\nORION: Well, let's go discover it.\nMARISHA: Well, from what I heard, we head south towards Sunder Peak. Towards the southwest, it's volcanic territory.\nTRAVIS: Should we ask how far it is?\nMARISHA: Maybe. I only got vague directions.\nLIAM: Can we see Sunder Peak from here?","response":"DM: The landscape is very heavily wooded, and the canopy of the forest tends to rise and lower about the height of the wall itself. You can't really see anything beyond the wall of the city of Vasselheim, anyway."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So remember that way, we found a hydra, so we might come across some terrible things.\nTRAVIS: One of you wordsmiths go talk to somebody and ask directions.\nLAURA: I flag down the nearest person.","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's happening. There's nothing you can do to stop this anymore. Embrace the inevitable.\nLAURA: 15.","response":"DM: Asking around and gathering a few folks and asking them questions, eventually you flag down one guy at the far end of the tavern; he's an amateur cartographer who's in the middle of sketching out the nearest area. He talks to you for a bit and you mention Sunder Peak Mountains and he goes, “Oh yeah, yes, no. Sunder Peak. It's not too far from Vasselheim. It's about two days' travel, on horseback southwest. The Sunder Peak Mountains themselves, be careful; they're pretty steep. I haven't actually gone within the mountain range myself, but I've been within a few miles of it just to make sure that I can mark it on my map, but yeah. It should be fine. Stay on the road.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, stay on the road.\nMARISHA: Do you actually have a map that we could use? Borrow?","response":"DM: “This is not done. And I need to finish it before I can give it to a printer to make more.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What's your girlfriend's name?","response":"DM: “I should go.” And he folds up his map."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, wait! We'll be on the lookout for key things in the landscape to maybe give you information for your maps?","response":"DM: “Well, that would be very helpful.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What's your name?","response":"DM: “Tyriok.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Tyriok?","response":"DM: “Tyriok.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Matthew, we've been doing this for three years, and you still fucking blow me away game after game. I'm sorry. Tyriok, I meant to say.","response":"DM: “Anything you come across, please do take note of it. If you require a small piece of parchment, I can perhaps provide that as well.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, yeah. Yeah.\nASHLEY: Wait, what happens if you don't stay on the road?","response":"DM: “Well, forests tend to– ”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I mean I have an idea, but–","response":"DM: “There are things that live there that are generally pretty dangerous. They've had people who've travelled on these routes and at some point they've been attacked. Or worse, never came back.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wow. Do you know what they've been attacked by?","response":"DM: “I haven't.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: You don't know.\nLAURA and MARISHA: Hydra.\nASHLEY: Hydra?\nLAURA: We fought a hydra, Pike.\nASHLEY: Not as in the– I understand.\nLAURA: Like, five heads.","response":"DM: Glances back over at Grog's ominous stare towards him again. “I should be leaving.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Parchment.","response":"DM: “Yes.” Hands you this rolled-up piece, relatively well-made."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We will use this to make notes.","response":"DM: “I appreciate that greatly.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You wouldn't happen to have a compass, would you?","response":"DM: “No? Not that I can lend out.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We could make a compass if we really needed one. It's not hard to make a compass.","response":"DM: “Anyway. I'm usually here in the morning. Just going about my business. So whenever you need to find me–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA and MARISHA: Tyriok.","response":"DM: He goes and heads off. You guys are welcome to prepare as you wish."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, we need horses, right? We don't want to walk.\nLAURA: Don't we have horses from our previous–","response":"DM: Your team has horses. This team does not."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But we have enough horses for all of us, from our previous run.\nTALIESIN: We had two extra horses.","response":"DM: You did."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah. Let's just take those horses. We don't even have to pay for them.\nMARISHA: Awesome.\nTRAVIS: I need a new horse, because mine's back, the horse–\nLAURA: The back buckled?\nTALIESIN: You can ride the bear.\nLAURA: No, he can't.","response":"DM: It was pretty rough getting you there, even as a warhorse. You weigh a lot."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So probably a new horse.\nMARISHA: Wait. You drove the horse into the ground?\nLAURA: Okay, so we need two extra horses.\nLIAM: Oh, we're getting more? Did you bust up the last one?\nTRAVIS: He's all like this.\nLAURA: Okay. Let's go find a couple of horses. I'm going to ride Trinket, so we only need one extra horse.\nMARISHA: A warhorse for Grog.\nLAURA: Yes? I go get a horse for Grog.","response":"DM: Okay. The cost of the warhorse. Initially, when you get there, the stablehand who you talked to originally, “You've gone already through it. I can offer you another war horse. We're starting to run a little low, if you keep tearing through them at this rate.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, we'll say we're covered though, yeah.","response":"DM: “Oh, that's 400 gold to purchase yourself a warhorse.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, 400. Darling, remember who we are. We gave you excellent business before. I have no idea what I'm saying.\nTRAVIS: Come on, this is your thing. Come on.\nLAURA: I think, as a return customer, you can offer us more of a deal than that.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Come on. Natural 20!\n(shouting)\nTRAVIS: It's verified. That's a 20.","response":"DM: He goes, “Here. How about this. I will, based on your previous patronage, and if you can ensure that you would continue to send business my way, I would be happy to give it to you at half price.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course. Half price is a very fair deal. Grog. Pay the man.\nTRAVIS: Would you be interested in negotiating? Right. 200 gold.","response":"DM: (chuckling) Mark off 200 gold."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wait, for two horses? Don't we need two?","response":"DM: There was a warhorse for him, and then there's two amongst you. I don't know if you wanted to become a horse and run."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I was going to ride Trinket so that there were three for them.\nTRAVIS: You could take the busted-up horse. It just can't carry me anymore.\nLIAM: Trinket could take Pike, too, with you.\nLAURA: Yeah, me and Pike will ride Trinket.","response":"DM: Okay. Well, then you're fine."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is there another warhorse for sale for that price? Can we get the two for 400?","response":"DM: If you ask about this, he's like, “That wasn't part of the deal. If you want another warhorse, that's a different transaction entirely.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'll take one. Full price. I won't bargain.","response":"DM: “400 gold.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wait, but where do you put Lockheed Peach?\nORION: How much extra for some side saddles?","response":"DM: “Side saddles for that? I'll throw those in for free, for full price purchase, certainly. Side saddlebags for your warhorse.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Tiberius, I want it to be known that if you keep asking me for party funds, I will not be so–\nORION: These are my personal, of course. I would not want to upset you again, milady Vex. I have missed your company.\nLAURA: You're so charming today, Tiberius.\nLIAM: He called you a lady.\nLAURA: He did.\nLAURA: Let's go see your family.\nMARISHA: (high-pitched) Okay!\nTRAVIS: And then if we get– if we get just outside of the– I'll wait.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys gather your horses, fresh warhorse and saddlebags upon yours as well, Tiberius. Fine sturdy steeds. This one looks to be a little more physically built than the previous one you purchased. Hopefully, it should last you a little longer. Hopefully. You make your way towards the southern gate of Vasselheim. The Bastions open it for you and lead you out to the front road that exits the south side of the city. Slowly, it begins to divide into a southeast and southwest direction. You guys, using the directions you acquired previously, begin pushing yourself in the southwestern direction of the path, leading you deep into the Vesper Timberlands. You notice the canopy of the forest itself is so thick and high that it is not so much an open pathway more than it is an open archway, a tunnel that has been carved through the forest for this path. It is a very dense, very dark– even in the midday sun– pathway, and it progresses this way for miles and miles. You can hear birds and the wildlife living loudly and out in the open amongst this forest. There are certain portions of the trail that you do see are being encroached upon by the forest and trees themselves. There are roots and vines that begin to stretch and try to reclaim the road, and you get the sensation that people that traverse here a lot have to perpetually keep it clear. There is something about this forest that in itself is its own breathing entity beyond what a normal forest would be. It seems to grow at a much faster pace, and even your previous experience in the deep portions of this forest, it almost has its own omnipresent, malicious presence. Continuing down for the rest of the day, eventually the sun comes to set and what little bit of moonlight that would find its way through the canopy is entirely cut off by the thickness of the leaves and boughs of the trees. You can continue to go through the night, if you wish to."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Light! (igniting sound)","response":"DM: A big beacon of light blasts out, continuing pushing forward down this pathway. It's about 9:30pm, and you have pretty good visual in front of you based on the light source that is Tiberius. How long do you want to push on forward?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm a little concerned, Tiberius. I'm afraid that some creatures might be attracted to that light source. It might actually be best to–\nORION: Oh. (snuffing sound)","response":"DM: Darkness once again takes the pathway."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is there any moonlight?","response":"DM: You gather, glancing up, there are fractions and little pieces that give you the sense that some of the clouds have parted, and moonlight would be visible if you weren't underneath such a thick canopy of brush. If not for your darkvision and the little bit of light in there, you'd have no visual."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Light the end of your staff.\nORION: I'm going to cast Light under one of the flaps of my robe. (igniting sound)\nLIAM: Tibs. I pull off and hand him my Cloak of Elvenkind, which is one of the reasons I'm so hard to see. Maybe we could just use that as a shroud for it, just for tonight. I'll pass it to Tibs.\nORION: (igniting sound) I'll cast it under that, and you can be the source of light.","response":"DM: Instead of a beaming beacon of bright light, it has now become essentially a hood lantern that you are now directionally focusing."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Now you look really cool.\nTRAVIS: Do we want to push on, or do we want to rest? We should push on.\nMARISHA: We're on a path?\nLIAM: 9:00 at night, you said?","response":"DM: It's 9:00 at night, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I think it's time to bed down. I mean, we're not in Los Angeles.\nMARISHA: How far did we make it?","response":"DM: I'd say, from when you left, it's probably been about six hours of travel, approximately, to where you are now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh, it would be smart. We've got another day's travel tomorrow.\nTRAVIS: Okay. Make camp.\nTALIESIN: Let's bed down. It's not like we don't have to sleep eventually.\nTRAVIS: I'll take the first watch.\nMARISHA: I'll do my Anti-Life Shell for the first hour. That way we all get an hour of good sleep.\nTRAVIS: Can I trace back a hundred yards and Dust of Tracelessness it, from where we came?\nLAURA: The Hunter's Mark that I cast on that merchant. Did he stay in town, or is he out and about? Can I sense that?","response":"DM: At this distance?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Six measly little hours of travel. I can track it.\nLIAM: Are you haggling with the fabric of time and space?\nLAURA: No, I'm just seeing if I can track the dude I put a Hunter's Mark on, is all.\nTRAVIS: She went back to the 30s.\nLAURA and TRAVIS: See?","response":"DM: I would say, at this distance, if you've travelled you've lost contact with him, however on the way out you got the sensation that he was still in the city, just not in the thoroughfare that he was originally spotted in."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Mourning getting negotiated so hard.\nORION: I'm going to roll real quick. I was going to do animal handling; that's the roll? Animal handling every day so I can train it to do stuff? So I didn't gain a point today. And I take out the Decanter of Endless Water– water, anybody?– And then I'm feeding Lockheed some.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to try and cast some more ammunition, since I'm out.\nMARISHA: I pull out my little book of druid spells and history, and I start freshening up on some fire spells.\nLAURA: I try to get Trinket to eat some vegetables.\nLIAM: I pass the fuck out.\nLAURA: Trinket! Your uncle said your poo is runny. You need to eat some veggies.","response":"DM: (bear noises) Trinket nuzzles his nose and pushes it out of your hand on to the ground."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: If I have the first watch, I have darkvision, and I take out my Firebrand Warhammer as I begin my watch.","response":"DM: Okay. It burns like a torch in your hand."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, no fire.","response":"DM: No fire. Okay. You, because the only supplies you have to craft some ammunition without having an actual smithy at your disposal, it is possible; it's just difficult. So go ahead and take your tinker's tool check with disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: God damn it. 14.","response":"DM: 14? You use the remainder of your supplies that are currently on you. You manage to construct 12 rounds of ammunition for your Pepperbox, but you are currently out after that. And you were down to about three pieces left?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I was getting a little iffy.","response":"DM: I put you at a total of 15 bullets for your Pepperbox."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can you use bulette armor to make more bullets?\nTALIESIN: I can use metal. They're basically made of iron, so honestly I don't know.\nTRAVIS: We have two more pieces of broken-up armor and a lantern. And manacles.\nLIAM: And you're on watch, right? Before I passed out I handed him my cloak, all wadded up in a ball around it, and handed it to him.","response":"DM: Okay. It's hard for you to repurpose anything metal without an actual smelter."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah. I knew I would just get a little bit on the road right now.","response":"DM: Yeah. And you can try for the Bad News ammunition. You should be about five shots left."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Five shots. That sounds about enough.\nORION: So to take a long rest, I take can one hour or two hours? To still have a long rest and do stuff.","response":"DM: A long rest is eight hours."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So an hour before that, I'm starting to enchant the staff.","response":"DM: Enchanting for a staff is a day focus. You can do it slowly over time to help offset that, but it'll take you a lot longer to do it on the road. It's more of like, when you get back and you want to focus on enchanting it, you can get it done. Cool. You go over your spells, you have that crafted, torch, anything else before you go to bed?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do I get an up to my hit points at level 11? Do I get to roll more hit points at level 11?","response":"DM: Yes. Have you not done that yet?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I haven't done anything other than take my new abilities.","response":"DM: Okay, well let's go ahead and do that right now."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Roll a d10?","response":"DM: d10 plus your constitution modifier. Percy is now level 11."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, that happened.\nTRAVIS: Welcome!\nASHLEY: Yeah!\nTALIESIN: That's ten. I'm up ten points. Hit points.","response":"DM: What'd you roll?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I rolled an eight, and my constitution modifier is two.","response":"DM: Right, ten more hit points."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh and actually, you know what. Before we go to sleep, or actually first thing in the morning before I learn my new spells–","response":"DM: You're also three attacks per round now, which is awesome."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes, I am.\nMARISHA: I'm also going to go ahead and be like, hey guys. I made breakfast! And make a Heroes' Feast.\nLAURA: Another Heroes' Feast?\nTRAVIS: At night or in the morning?\nMARISHA: At night, because I had it learned.","response":"DM: Everyone's going to eat a Heroes' Feast before bed? Okay?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait. How long does it last us?\nMARISHA: 24 hours?","response":"DM: Yeah, it's 24 hours."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, so until we go to bed tomorrow.\nMARISHA: Yeah. Because I'm learning new spells in the morning.\nTALIESIN: What do we get?","response":"DM: As you pull out the second gem-encrusted bowl that you purchased in the bazaar earlier, you mark off another thousand gold pieces from your personal fund, and as you guys watch, Keyleth all of a sudden puts her hands out in front of her, and from the very earth itself around your campsite (fwoosh) springs forth this long table of cornucopias and fruits and fine meats. The smell permeates the air like the best eating hall you've ever been to."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! Bananas!\nMARISHA: I thought of you.\nLAURA: This is amazing, Keyleth.\nASHLEY: Oh, man!\nTRAVIS: I pick up Keyleth, I give her a big squeeze. Oh, thank you.\nMARISHA: (choking noises) Grog!\nTRAVIS: Oh, sorry. I drop her.\nASHLEY: I'm going to try the carpet again.","response":"DM: Okay, so as you're eating and chopping, you step away from the table and set the carpet down, and you grab your holy symbol, and you close your eyes, praying up to Sarenrae to hopefully in some way, shape, or form, be of an aid in restoring this once-enchanted ally."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Be a zero or a one.\nASHLEY: Two.\nLAURA: Isn't that good, to roll a two?\nTRAVIS: She has to hit 11 or under.","response":"DM: You sense that once again, the attention of Sarenrae is scattered. And at this moment in time, you feel like there is little attention towards this small arcane artifact that was lost not of your own hand."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I know. I'm sorry, Sarenrae.\nMARISHA: So at the top of the morning, as part of the Heroes' Feast, everyone gets 2d12–","response":"DM: 2d10. 2d10 additional hit points to your maximum."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And you heal that, as well.\nLAURA: For a day?\nTRAVIS: We roll that right now?\nMARISHA: And you also fill up that, as well.\nASHLEY: Yay, that's amazing.\nLIAM: That's tight, right there.\nLAURA: Tight!\nLIAM: Yes, thank you for introducing that to Liam's vocabulary.\nMARISHA: Also, everyone now has advantage on their wisdom saving throws.\nTRAVIS: Just for the day, right?\nMARISHA: For 24 hours.","response":"DM: You're immune to poison, immune to diseases, immune to being frightened, and all wisdom saving throws have advantage."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Immune to being frightened? All of us?","response":"DM: After eating this meal, it instills you with an extremely powerful nature-based enchantment. You feel your physical form given unnatural heartiness, and the confidence instills your entire body. And so you are immune to poison, immune to disease, immune to frightened, and you get advantage on your wisdom saving throws for 24 hours."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I ain't afraid of no ghosts.\nASHLEY: The opposite of tryptophan?\nTRAVIS: (snoring)\nLIAM: (gasps)\nTRAVIS: Fuck!\nASHLEY: You fell asleep!\nTRAVIS: No! No. It was just so calm that once the sun came up, I heard you– I fell asleep.\nLAURA: You've got a lot of drool in your beard.\nLIAM: I'll take the first watch next time. Everything's good. No use crying over spilt milk. Let's keep going.\nMARISHA: It's good to have a good night's sleep, though.\nLIAM: Yoink. Thank you. (whoosh)\nTRAVIS: Sorry! Zero… zero!","response":"DM: Hundred. No progression on your beard."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Aw, I thought it was like the lowest roll you could ever do.\nLAURA: Zero means ten. That's a hundred. That's the best you can do.\nLIAM: The lowest you can get is ten.\nTRAVIS: Shit.\nLIAM: Or 11, really.\nTRAVIS: They call me Honest Grog. Like Lincoln? No?\nTALIESIN: No, I was there. I was with you.\nTRAVIS: Zero, zero! Hundred.\nLAURA: Let's go!\nORION: Feed Lockheed.\nLAURA: Leftover from the big feast.","response":"DM: There's been no change in Lockheed's health visually yet. But you continue the process. You push forward for the remainder of the day, eventually getting to the end of your second day of travel. As the sun is beginning to slowly set, you watch the direction it's passing and you can see now in the distance what appears to be a large mountain range beginning to appear above the breaks in the canopy where you can see part of the trees begin to part. There are aspects of the sky visible. You can see the clouds have regathered; there's a little bit of sunlight that breaks through every now and then, you can see just the general glow of the sky as it pushes over, but you do see the edge of a mountain range in the distance, probably no more than a couple hours of travel to get to the actual base of."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (worried sounds)\nORION: That wasn't a word.\nTRAVIS: Is that an Ashari song?\nMARISHA: I'm just– it's just a lot of pressure. It's good.\nORION: So how should we approach?\nMARISHA: Well, just. Approach. Like one would. Approach.","response":"DM: You hear a sudden clap of thunder (thunderclap). Comes rumbling through the sky. And you can see, above the mountain range, the clouds that are gathering are very dark, and a roiling thunderstorm is starting to break over the mountain range. You see flashes of light from within, and a few other claps of thunder rolling over the mountain range."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does it look natural?","response":"DM: It looks like a thunderstorm. It's not ominously dark more than what you're used to, but it looks like there is a thunderstorm blowing through."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do a nature check, see how long it's going to hang out? Ooh, 17, that's 27.","response":"DM: You take a moment and watch it. It is stationary. Taking a very close look, it doesn't appear to be pouring any rain. It's just a thick gathering of black thunderclouds that has yet to release its watery payload."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What do you think, Keyleth? Does it look safe to traverse?\nMARISHA: It just formed, right? We watched it happen?","response":"DM: As you approached and noticed, you could see that the storm is there."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Apparently, your people have a taste for the theatrics.\nLAURA: Do you think that's where they are?\nMARISHA: I drop to my knees, and I do Commune With Nature.","response":"DM: As you spend a little time focusing on the landscape around you. What's the range on that?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's big. 5th-level spell.\nMARISHA: Looks like that's the way.\nLIAM: Is it safe to just approach?\nMARISHA: That's what I did with the Earth Ashari, but I mean, they were welcoming and kind.\nORION: Maybe they will be, too. You know, maybe they just like being warm.\nASHLEY: Do they have a reputation of being–\nMARISHA: We haven't made contact with them in almost two generations. I don't know. Last time we made contact with them it was fine, and everyone was good, but who knows. It's been a while, because my mother didn't come back.\nLIAM: This is maybe awkward, but you and we share something in common. Our past is awkward. I get the sense that yours is not as much. Your people, are they a mix of many kinds?\nMARISHA: How we came to be– for all we know; once again, roughly a thousand years ago– certain people possessed natural abilities. We assumed we were blessed by the gods of nature, and when we realized we had these abilities and then the Sundering happened, that's when we banded together, but it could have been anyone between humans, elves, there were a few dwarfs, gnomes. Mainly humans and elves. So we're primarily– I guess you could say mutts. Primarily half-elven, but we separated off into our own separate tribes, so we each developed our own individual cultures, even though we came from the same root.\nLIAM: But predominantly a melding of humans and elves.\nMARISHA: But we're accepting of all races. At least, the Air and the Earth Ashari are.\nORION: And I assume they are steeped in tradition, as well, such as your own people.\nMARISHA: Yes, absolutely. And each tribe has its own tradition. It's had a lot of time to develop.\nORION: Oh, I see. I'm going to reach in my– Dust of Illusion, and–\nLIAM: Friendly fire!\nORION: It's okay. It didn't break.","response":"DM: That was the day that Orion set himself on fire."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We just hit 7,000 subs when Orion set himself on fire!\nORION: It happens all the time when you bend it.\nORION: It's fine. We're all okay.\nMARISHA: It touched my ass! It hit me in the ass.\nTALIESIN: There's, like, five jokes I'm not making right now.\nORION: And I just sprinkle some on myself, and I turn my scales silver.","response":"DM: Okay. (magic noise) All of your scales shift into a glistening silver color, that of the same scales that the followers of Bahamut had adorned their armor with when you went to that section of Vasselheim."}
{"prompt":"ORION: This is the color my brother Faeryn is.\nLAURA: It looks good on you.\nLIAM: Yes. So you're a silver-colored dragonborn now?\nORION: If they are steeped in tradition, the metallic dragonkin are more welcome in societies, more than the chromatic. As we've seen.\nLIAM: Judging books by their cover, yes. I ride my horse around in a circle just to face everybody and say, everyone, maybe go a bit back, go behind Keyleth. Vex'ahlia and I will trail just behind as your retinue.\nMARISHA: Sure.\nASHLEY: Is there anything we can do to help? Or just make you feel a little bit more at ease?\nMARISHA: I don't know what to expect.\nORION: I have this Longbottom herb you can smoke before we go?\nMARISHA: I'm good. I'll wait.\nLIAM: We need her clear, Tiberius.\nMARISHA: See, what I'm most nervous about is, when I went to the Earth Tribe they said that my mother had passed through. And went through her training, and her Ulare trip, and she was fine. And then continued on.\nLAURA: Maybe your mother's still here?","response":"DM: (thunder) Another lightning clap."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's get a move on, I think.\nMARISHA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Keyleth, we're all here behind you. You've got this.\nLAURA: We'll pretend to be your small army. You are our leader.\nMARISHA: Okay. And please, don't mention anything about us being called the SHITs when we first got started.\nASHLEY: Vox Machina, that's all it is.\nTRAVIS: Wait, is that Kashaw? Made you look. Break the tension! Never mind, you've got it.","response":"DM: You continue riding towards the mountain range at the base of the Sunder Peak Mountains. Eventually the forest begins to give way as the ground itself becomes less and less hospitable to vegetation. There's a certain smell to the air that seems to come through the wind that buffets the bottom of the mountain range itself. It smells like a distant forest fire. Like, you can smell almost like burnt cedar, a little bit of ash to the air. You make your way to the base. Everyone roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 15.\nTALIESIN: 17.\nMARISHA: Nervous. 14.\nASHLEY: 17.\nLAURA: 15.\nTRAVIS: Eight.\nORION: 13.\nMARISHA: 14.","response":"DM: Okay. Percy. Everyone else, you look about this mountain range and it's just the sheer edge, like there's no real sign, outside from climbing it up, how you'd manage to find–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Is it favored terrain?","response":"DM: Is mountainous part of your favored terrain?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, is it still mountains?","response":"DM: Yes, these are mountains. You glance up, though. You notice that there is apparently two paths that diverge at the very base. They're very steep, back and forth switchback winding paths that lead up the front of the mountain. It's hard to see exactly where they lead, because once they reach a certain point the rest of the mountain cliff seems to blend into itself. But you do notice there are two maybe five-foot wide, very thin switchback paths that lead up the side of the mountain."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh look, we have two options for our ways up.\nLIAM: Two paths, Percy?\nTALIESIN: Two paths. I want to examine the path to see if there's one that's been more trod.\nLIAM: Let's choose the one less travelled, then.\nTALIESIN: That won't make much of a difference.","response":"DM: We're cultured."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 14.","response":"DM: 14. Glancing at the two sides, the left path appears to be far more worn. The right path is largely untouched, with a thin layer of ash coating it, so you get the feeling that one hasn't seen use in quite some time."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Are the prints going both directions, or is there a majority going one or the other?","response":"DM: On the left side, they seem to go both ways, but even those prints are fairly old. At least a week or two has seen any sort of traction on the path."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Footprints, horse prints, both?","response":"DM: Footprints."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No horse prints.","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What do you see, Percival?\nTALIESIN: I see the path is probably too treacherous to bring the horses. We might want to leave them here. One path has barely been touched, the other one has been pretty well ridden through. I say we take the more common path.","response":"DM: So you leave your horses behind? Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Are there trees to tie them up?","response":"DM: There are some trees towards the edge here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait, why are we taking the more traveled one? Do you think your family is more reclusive?\nMARISHA: Our tribe, we generally can still make contact and trade with nearby towns, generally. There might be more traveled ones, once again I'm not sure.\nLIAM: Yeah, the one that Keyleth's people, or cousins, or whatever they are, have been taking.\nMARISHA: Yeah, let's try the path more traveled first.","response":"DM: So you guys leave your horses behind. You tie them up to one of the nearby trees, one that's off to the side, leave a little bit of feed for them."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We tied them.","response":"DM: Okay. You make your way up the switchback path, up the side of the mountain. It is relatively steep. It continues up at about a 40-degree incline, and there are certain moments where it tends to pinch to about a two-foot-wide path, and you have to uncomfortably put your back to the side of the mountain to get through those passes. You're about, I'd say about an hour and a half, two hours later, the sun has officially set, and what little bit of moonlight would be brought forth is currently encased by the thunderstorm ahead, and you do still hear the occasional clap of thunder and see the occasional flash that almost seems to be happening above the range, out of visual sight."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I think we need light so we don't go over the edge.\nORION: Sure. (igniting sound)","response":"DM: Tiberius creates a beacon of light at the edge of his staff, and being centrally located to the team, is a fairly good source of visual light to the pathway. You guys continue to go up the side. I'm going to go ahead and have everybody do a constitution saving throw here."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Druid dice! Not good.\nORION: 18.\nTALIESIN: 13.\nMARISHA: Nine.\nLAURA: Nine.\nASHLEY: 17.\nTRAVIS: 18.","response":"DM: This isn't a chill-based thing. The air itself, the wind that's blowing down, is filled with this thick ash-type dust that's coming through here. You're finding yourself coughing. It's getting into your lungs a little bit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I've got a mask for this. I'm going to put on the mask.","response":"DM: Okay, you pull your mask down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I pull my hood up.","response":"DM: No immediate effects, but you find yourself unable to suppress an occasional cough. You continue up the side of the mountain. You guys pull your cloth up over your faces. You make your way. It's pushing almost midnight at this point in time, and you're getting tired, your legs are growing sore from the constant perpetual walk upwards at an angle. The path begins to become less of a switchback, and you can see it's beginning to pull inwards towards what looks like a ravine in the mountain range. There's an area where the actual mountain carves inward and leads into the mountain range proper. During that time, Vex, as you guys are making your way up to this slight inward path and it starts pushing into the mountain range, less dangerous and less pressed against the mountain as you were previously, you notice up at the top there are a few shadowed figures just out of your visual range that you can just make out over the backlight of the clouds in the sky."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do they look–","response":"DM: You can make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fuck. I chose poorly. That's terrible. Yeah. Eight.","response":"DM: Eight. At this distance, it's hard to really make out any sort of visual on their form, their size, but you just see there's a handful of them and it looks like three figures that are moving in unison along the ridge a little ways up ahead of you guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shut up.","response":"DM: Can I go ahead and get a stealth check from the group? With disadvantage on the ones that failed their constitution saves."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How do we know if we failed?","response":"DM: The fail is the nine or below. Yeah. I'll let you know if it's a fail or not, but you guys, everyone has to make a stealth check, and the ones who currently have the coughs have disadvantage on the roll."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Who has the coughs? How do we know?\nTRAVIS: Your clanging armor didn't do nothing!\nMARISHA: Did I fail? With a nine?","response":"DM: With a nine? Yes, you did. You're also coughing."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh my god.\nORION: 22.\nTALIESIN: 11.\nMARISHA: 14.","response":"DM: 14?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 21.\nLAURA: Whoa.\nASHLEY: 19.\nALL: Whoa!\nASHLEY: I have been oiling my armor.\nTRAVIS: She didn't have disadvantage. She rolled a 17 on her constitution.","response":"DM: Right, so you were fine."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How did Trinket do?\nLAURA: 15. I did not roll for Trinket for either of those things.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll stealth on Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Mighty two.\nTRAVIS: A mighty two.\nLAURA: You're so annoying.\nTRAVIS: You know you don't have to breathe all of it in every time.\nLIAM: Oh, right, no. 15, sorry, 15. For stealth, right?","response":"DM: For stealth."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (coughs loudly)","response":"DM: As you guys make your way into the path and she points this out, there's a couple people that kind of, there's a quiet silence, and then (coughing) a couple of coughs coming through. Shushed as best you can, you can see the figures shift and then vanish from sight."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Should we hurry? What do you think?\nLAURA: Well, they know now.\nMARISHA: I'm going to do a perception check and see if I can see any sign of a village or a town or my people. 23.","response":"DM: Looking around, the pathway still continues upward, and it continues and then disappears over a ridge where the mountains come inward to the closest portion where the mountain range tends to break. You can't see anything beyond that, because it's still too far away from you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Knowing my people and my tribe, would I know if these were centurions?","response":"DM: You have no idea. You haven't been to this territory. You know that centurions usually are sent out, and people keep watch on the landscape around, but you have no idea."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Because I know the mountains, are we still on that crappy narrow precipice?","response":"DM: That crappy path is starting to move inward finally towards the actual mountain; it's starting to crest over into the top area, where it goes into almost more like a ravine where the two walls of the mountain come together to give you a small valley path that leads–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Could I look and see if there are any boulder, avalanche-type situations that I can see–","response":"DM: Sure, make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Can I clarify something? Am I giving Scanlan a shoulder-ride right now, or is he knocking boots back in Vasselheim?","response":"DM: Yeah. Scanlan… paid well for enough attention to celebrate his current non-freezing-death or smashing by a dragon. He's still recovering through the positive reinforcement of numerous female workers."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes, I call it a tiefling trio.\nTRAVIS: There's going to be art for that.\nTALIESIN: Don't say things like that out loud.","response":"DM: Do you guys continue?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I think so.\nLAURA: Can I– I mean–\nMARISHA: Let's continue on.\nORION: I rolled an 18, because I want to do an arcana check for anything I can feel from that storm.","response":"DM: 18. Best you can gather, the storm is localized, it is not moving, and this type of storm seems to be more generated not because there is a gathering of storm activity or any natural rain that falls in this area– and in fact, most of the rock and landscape you see here is very dry– this usually accompanies a place of very strong power. Natural occurrences where there is a funnel or focus of some sort of unbridled arcane or divine energy tends to call this type of aberrant weather pattern to it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: This would sometimes happen at the Air Ashari, as well. We'd get windstorms occasionally. It happens.","response":"DM: You hear a strange clacking sound, and you glance up just in time to see a large boulder (booming sounds) down the mountain. So for this one in particular, this would be towards the people that are in front. That would be Keyleth, Vex, Vax, and Trinket."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do I have enough time to react?","response":"DM: You guys can go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw."}
{"prompt":"ORION: How big is the boulder?","response":"DM: It's roughly six feet in diameter. It barrels through the vicinity."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 23.","response":"DM: One?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Can I try to do something right now?","response":"DM: We'll let them do the reaction first."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What was my number? It was 13? 13 for me, and Trinket gets 13, as well.","response":"DM: 13 and 13."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Can I try and do something?","response":"DM: As soon as I finish their action, basically the boulder (smack) and they all tried to dodge out of the way, and then you can do your action."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to try to cast Telekinesis, and (whoosh).","response":"DM: Okay. The casting of the spell itself takes a moment. It's one of those things where it's not an instant thing, you have to do the motions for it. It's not so much instant. However, as the boulder manages to roll by, all of you except for Vax manage to roll out of the way in time. Everyone ducked out as the boulder trucks past. You take 16 points of bludgeoning damage as the boulder slams into your side."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 60?\nMARISHA, MATT, and TALIESIN: 16","response":"DM: You immediately glance up to the top, and you can now see three figures have gathered at the very top of this ridge, and you can see two more are lifting boulders."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Lifting boulders?\nLAURA: Oh, are they giants? Are they more fucking giants?","response":"DM: Glancing up, best you can see, and they're about 45 to 50 feet up on this ridge-line. They appear to be larger than normal humans. They are humanoid. You, with your highest perception, glance up and you can see each one has two heads across one set of shoulders. (straining noises)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we get in a place that boulders won't hit us? If we get right up against the cliff face?","response":"DM: You can certainly try."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So now we see that happening?","response":"DM: You guys all see this happening now."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Cool, so as I see the next one I cast Telekinesis on the one he's about to throw and huck it right back at him.","response":"DM: Okay. One of the boulders gets loosed; now this one's coming towards the bottom group here as Tiberius, you reach up and do that. Go ahead and roll a strength check, with the strength of the boulder, which I believe is– (muttering) What's the strength check on this boulder?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How far away are they, roughly?","response":"DM: They're about 45 to 50 feet up on the pathway."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We could just bolt. We're at the bottom of the valley.\nORION: Okay, that was 15.\nMARISHA: Do you guys want to run?\nORION: Nope. Got a solid five.","response":"DM: Dexterity saving throw. Five?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 14 on the first one.\nTALIESIN: 18.","response":"DM: Okay. 14 is fine."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 13.\nASHLEY: 15?","response":"DM: 15? Okay. All but Tiberius, you guys dodge out the way. Tiberius, who's concentrating on the Telekinesis– (impact noise) The secondary boulder, unfortunately, connects. You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage. I need you to make a concentration check. Roll a d20. Add five to it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's 24.","response":"DM: 24? Yeah, you maintain concentration. As it almost knocks you off your side, you manage to (grunts) maintain your focus on the spell; your Telekinesis is still going."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I try to hit him with an arrow.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 16.","response":"DM: 16 hits. You go (flying arrow) you loose it and it goes hurtling up the side through the darkness and it finds purchase somewhere in the face of the entity. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah! 17.","response":"DM: 17, nice."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I didn't Hunter's Mark him.\nTALIESIN: Is the entity still lifting boulders?","response":"DM: There are two entities currently that are still up. One you can't see because it got the boulder smashed back into its face."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: As much as I like being targets for their lawn bowling, we are in the bottom of a fucking valley.\nMARISHA: Yeah, we're in a death pit, man.\nASHLEY: Run.","response":"DM: You guys just run? Okay. You start bolting forward (heavy steps). You can see the two entities now reach over and grab rocks and start running."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Run zig-zags!\nMARISHA: I turn around where they are right in front and throw up a big Wall of Stone.","response":"DM: They both throw boulders overhead, now arcing, missing the entire ravine trying to get it downward."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is my thing still going?","response":"DM: Your Telekinesis is still going, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to catch one and (whoosh).\nMARISHA: Don't take out my Wall of Stone!\nORION: No, I'm going to whack the dude.","response":"DM: One of them rolls down, and it would have impacted except for the Wall of Stone, it hits– let me see the strength of that– oh, it rolled a one on its strength. The boulder slams right at the bottom of the ravine, gets even more speed as it ramps up like a bowling ball and slams into the stone wall. The stone wall (impact noise) heaves and cracks, and portions of it fall and collapse, but it does manage to stop the force of that boulder. The second one comes overhead towards you. Go ahead and make a d20 roll and add five to it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 19.","response":"DM: 19? Yeah, I rolled an eight. You manage to (straining) catch the boulder. It's just on the cusp of the weight limit you would have on Telekinesis, but you manage to stop it in mid-air and catch it. You're just throwing it off to the side?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, I'm going to huck it right back to the other guy again! (swish, whoosh)","response":"DM: Okay. It's a heavy boulder and it's a long 50-foot distance away so I'm going to go ahead and have you roll another d20 plus five."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's 14.","response":"DM: 14. You manage to stop it from crushing your party, and you throw it up and it manages to roll up the side, get partway up, and then continue arcing and rolling down. Away from you guys, safely. Skee ball style."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Running!\nLAURA: I pat Tiberius on the back as I pull him along. Run!","response":"DM: You guys keep running. You notice as you're bolting forward, the two entities that are looming reach over and–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to stop, if I see one pick up a ball, I'm going to stop and take an action, if that's okay.","response":"DM: Sure, go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to swing around, I'm going to pull Bad News out as I swing around, back myself down, and I'm taking an aimed shot at its arm.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it. You're spending a grit point?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Spending a grit point. It's been so long. There we are. Yeah! Oh, the curse is broken, that's 29, 31.","response":"DM: 31. Definitively hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 31.","response":"DM: What does the arm shot do? It's no damage, right?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The arm shot is– okay, sorry. It's been a while. I've never done this one before. No damage, but it drops one item of my choice.","response":"DM: So as it's lifting the boulder, you fire, and it hits the elbow out from under it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And I use the strength of the shot to pick myself up and keep on running.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check. So as one of them is lifting a giant boulder–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 23.","response":"DM: 23? You're fine. Percy swings around, fires Bad News. That echoes through the entire ravine, (echoing gunshot) acting as a sound focus. You hear it echoing outward from the blast that sends Percy back, but Percy turns around, throws his arm down on the ground, and using the momentum from the blast picks himself up, leaps onto his feet, and continues running in time with the rest of you, a trail of smoke billowing behind him from the barrel of Bad News, which you can see is now glowing with a bit of red warmth, the metal itself heated from the sheer force of the blast. At this time, you look up and see one of the entities with the two heads is lifting a boulder over its head. One of its elbows (gunshot) out from under it (collapsing sound) as it collapses onto its head, and that one also falls out of view as the other one looks back and sets the boulder down. Starts shaking its fists at the air (angry grunting)."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: In Giant I call back, fuck you!","response":"DM: In Giant?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I don't know if it is a giant. It had two heads.\nTALIESIN: That felt really good.","response":"DM: You recognize the echoing voice, it says, “Come back here, food!” But you shout that back at it. It goes, “Hey!” You guys have just charged. At which point, the ravine begins to open into what looks like a– let me get a little out of this chaos here– the ravine opens up into a valley. It looks like the top of this mountain range, the top crested area surrounds this valley that slowly descends into the center of this large mountain. You guys have walked up the outside of it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: A hidden valley.\nASHLEY: Hidden Valley ranch. Sorry, it sounds so stupid.","response":"DM: The valley itself is roughly three miles across to the other side of this crested mountain range."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Three miles?","response":"DM: Yeah. You notice this valley is actually a settled-in, bowl-like caldera. You realize this particular mountain was once, or possibly still is, an active volcano. As you begin to move in closer, the ground itself becomes more and more jagged, with what looks like broken obsidian rock, sharp volcanic stone and glass. It is a very warm heat that this area tends to give off, and the temperature is now significantly causing you to sweat. Not just from the run, but the severe change in temperature from what you're used to in this area of the continent."}
{"prompt":"ORION: This feels great to me. I'm stretching out my scales, letting the heat in. Oh yeah, that's good.","response":"DM: The air, now, the burning wooden ash smell is becoming much stronger, and you re-adjust your cloth to cover your mouth. You also, as you begin to push closer and closer towards the center, you begin to see occasional pools of ashy mud dotting the landscape, where sulfurous gas caused the liquid earth to bubble and fume in certain patches."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Lady Keyleth, is that you? Oh, it's–\nASHLEY: Oh, are we–?","response":"DM: Everyone go ahead and roll perception."}
{"prompt":"ORION: As they are doing this with their noses, I'm going to open my bottle of air and just have it (soft spraying sound).\nMARISHA: Ooh! 28.\nTALIESIN: 15.\nASHLEY: 13.\nLAURA: 12, man.\nLIAM: One.\nLAURA: What is our rolls tonight?\nMARISHA: Twinsies. Twinsies rolls.\nORION: That is a negative two.\nORION: There, see?\nLIAM: Take that, game, take that.","response":"DM: Far off in the distance, Keyleth, as the rest of you look at the landscape, you see what looks like a small forest, a very localized forest right in the center of the valley. You can see a cluster of trees that exists about a mile, a mile and a half away from your current position. As you guys continue pushing forward, you start seeing larger stone clusters and formations, almost like a very violent activity were forcing and jutting up portions of stone out of this caldera at some point."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if it's natural, from earthquakes, or if earthbenders have done it? 25.","response":"DM: Looking at it, it appears that a lot of it appears to be natural, but there are portions that appear to be sculpted or have sections that are cleaved off or taken by possible tools for use of building or other purposes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And most of it appears to be obsidian?","response":"DM: Obsidian, volcanic rock, which is very porous and light and somewhat brittle in places, and occasionally you see sections of glass, smooth glass that fill pockets across the ground. As you get about half a mile to three-quarters of a mile into this caldera, towards that forest you were seeing in the distance, there is a loud grinding of stone out of nowhere, this (grinding) sound. All of you glance around as suddenly (whooshing) a series of stone walls rise out of the ground, surrounding you. Front, back, side to side, and a fifth one closes the top off. You are now left in complete darkness, imprisoned in what seems to be some sort of a stone cube."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What? (Light sound effect)\nTRAVIS: Oh my god!\nORION: Sorry.\nLAURA: Really bright in here.","response":"DM: As you look around indeed, relatively rough-looking stone walls have completely encapsulated you guys on all five sides. You are all entirely trapped inside the structure about 40 feet high and 40 feet across."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We dig? We dig down? Can we dig?\nORION: I think a Fireball can do this– no I'm just kidding.\nTRAVIS: I take the warhammer, activate it and run up towards the walls and swing as hard as I can into one of the walls.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and roll a strength check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (strained wince)\nASHLEY: Can I assist?\nTRAVIS: 19.\nASHLEY: Oh, you don't need assistance.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I do. From Pike, anytime.\nLAURA and ASHLEY: Nine.","response":"DM: So the two of you together slam your weapons into the side of the wall, a portion of the stone cracks a little and chips fall out, but the stone still stands pretty solidly."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Everybody stop! Keyleth!\nMARISHA: Can I see through it where they chipped away?","response":"DM: Where they chipped away, there's still more stone behind. You're not sure how thick these walls are."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We just wait or Keyleth talks. Wait.","response":"DM: About a moment later, you see a small red glow appear from a portion of the wall on the opposite side. Red glow, looking like a portion of the stone, about this wide, begins to glow bright red before dripping off molten, leaving a small slit. You can now see through the slit, a few heads appearing as one steps into, eyes, shifting, peering through the small space. “You trespass into our home. I will ask you once your business before we let the mountain's fury take you.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Please. I am Keyleth of the Air Ashari, and I am here to further my Aramente.","response":"DM: He looks back for a second. Go ahead and make a persuasion roll with advantage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I kneel down toward Keyleth.\nLAURA: And I bow.\nTALIESIN: Yeah.\nMARISHA: And I look around and I'm like–","response":"DM: So?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Persuasion?","response":"DM: With advantage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we assist?\nLIAM: We're doing it.\nMARISHA: Persuasion's not good. Ten.\nORION: I don't bow. I'm still at her side.","response":"DM: You guys have all kneeled around her. There is a moment where they all look about themselves. “So, Keyleth of the Air Ashari, you know of our people, you trek up here with a group of strangers at your sides, welcome weapons at the ready. I ask you, for the Aramente, whom do you call family? Whom gave you to this world?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: My father, Korren, and my mother, Vilya. My mother was my predecessor. Wait, no, that's– right? Yes, predecessor.\nORION: Yes, your Highness.\nMARISHA: She followed in my path. I'm following in her path.","response":"DM: The eyes have now moved away from the slot."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Damn it. God, I'm so bad at being eloquent.","response":"DM: A moment later, you hear a large (stone crushing), a large impact sound and a voice say, “Stand back!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How?\nASHLEY: For what?\nTRAVIS: We all back up.","response":"DM: As you all back away, the front wall of stone that was put up before you, that the eyes were looking through, suddenly (crashing) crumbles into a pile on its own, revealing the caldera before you, once again. There stand about ten individuals, all dressed in what looks like dark brown and black hides and leathers, with sections of what looks like obsidian-tipped weapons, certain arrows are cocked at the ready against the rest of you, and one individual, the one that was speaking to you earlier comes forward. You see all of these people, they are from varying races: dwarves, halflings, humans, about three half-elves among them, when an elven man comes forth, and you recognize through the eyes and the tone of voice, this is the one that spoke to you through the slit in the stone. He has no hair. Completely bald of all hair. Tattooed darkness around his eyes and you can see his entire left arm is covered in a long-healed but horrible burn scar. He steps up and gives you a nod of affirmation. “Then you shall tell this to the Flamespeaker. If you are indeed Ashari, he will know what to do with you. Come with us.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And what, might I ask, is your name?","response":"DM: Glances back over his shoulder. “Calhoun. But I'm not the one you wish to speak with.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hi, I'm Tiberius Stormwind.","response":"DM: He turns around and continues walking back towards the forest."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Let me do all the talking this time.\nLAURA: Would you like us to follow you, Your Majesty?\nMARISHA: Oh, you don't– yes, family, my brothers and sisters.\nLAURA: Got it.","response":"DM: You guys continue walking alongside Keyleth, and as you do, most of the druids flank you to each side, about four of them, with arrows still drawn, walking behind you as you progress. They are still armed and keeping a close eye on you as you travel."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is really not necessary.\nMARISHA: Just let them do it.","response":"DM: Calhoun leads the way and you guys continue traveling for about half an hour or so until eventually you begin to reach an area where you see more of these rock structures, but many of them have been carved out, or a series of stones have been gathered to build small huts and abodes. You can see this is essentially a village built from all the materials that were scavenged from or brought to this caldera to construct Pyrah, the realm of the Fire Ashari. As you move through the town, silence still claims the entirety of the druids that are escorting you, with Calhoun leading the way. You can see other druids begin coming out of their abodes, glancing around and watching you as you approach. No scowls, no smiles, just a general air of indifference amongst them as they carefully watch the strange outsiders stepping through their homestead. You are then led through the village to the outskirts of this forest. Now, the forest you see, as you get closer, all the trees are long dead and petrified. There is not a leaf among them, and most of the wood you see is either gray or black from being charred, burned, or dying over time and being petrified. As you head towards the edge of the forest, Calhoun stops and turns around and just crosses his arms and stares at you. “Sh.” At which point, the ground (explosion) shudders and you can see, in the distance, from within the forest almost, you see a large spray of molten rock disappear into the loose canopy of the burned trees before you, some sort of brief volcanic eruption seems to have sprayed out from the center of this cluster of dead trees. About 20 seconds later, you see a shape begin to emerge from the dead forest. Stepping out of the shadows, you see a man standing there. Human, very thick, sturdy build. No shirt, brass-colored bracers, long, billowing pants of a deep maroon color, with gold trim and designs. His skin is very darkened, whether by blood or by sun. He has a very dark complexion to him. His hair is long and jet black. You see his jaw is very square, and his cold black eyes show no emotion as he ignores the rest of you and steps toward Keyleth. (heavy footsteps) He walks right up to you. Now he's looking down at you. He's standing probably a good foot and a half taller. Once again, no emotion, no expression. “You are kin of Vilya, are you?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm… King of Vilya?\nORION: Kin.\nMARISHA: Oh, kin of Vilya. Yes, I am.","response":"DM: “I am Cerkonos, the Flamespeaker of Pyrah, the guardian of this rift. Welcome to Pyrah, my child. I must ask: why have you come?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I am here to complete my Aramente. I have already been to the Earth tribe.","response":"DM: He crosses his arms for a moment."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: My mother, Vilya, never returned to Zephrah.","response":"DM: “For you to be here on your Aramente, it is proof that she did not complete hers, or at least is no longer with us. I am sorry. She was strong of heart.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So she came through here?","response":"DM: “She did. She completed the trial, the challenges, and moved on to continue her Aramente about ten or so years back.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Only ten years ago! She's been gone for close to 20.\nLAURA: How long was she here?\nMARISHA: Yes, how long was she here?","response":"DM: “She stayed naught but three or four days… and then her journey took her. I'd hoped wherever she was, she was safe.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I check him to see if he is telling the truth? 22.","response":"DM: He seems stern, but honest. His words, genuinely, come from a place of worry and a tinge of regret at the knowledge that he's just received. “Your mother was strong of heart and was very fierce. She could stir the heart of the mountains themselves with a word. She was very well respected amongst us.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: She was better than I am.","response":"DM: “I hope not.” At this moment his face becomes a little darker and he says, “Korren? I assume he is well?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He is. As stubborn as always.\nMARISHA: Yes. These are my traveling companions, Vox Machina. They've proven themselves time and time again. We've been together for almost over a year now.","response":"DM: “Do you trust them?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I do. We actually have a keep now in Emon.","response":"DM: “Good. You'll need trust. You are here to learn, then, for your Aramente. To be tested, yes?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Correct.","response":"DM: “Then speak what you've learned to seek, what you wish to learn. What do you lack? What will be your death?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I have actually seen a vision of my death. From not having the will to do what is necessary, for fear of harming others, instead of protecting myself.","response":"DM: “Then the test begins now, without preparation. Do you also wish to join her in this task?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: For the first time, you see a smile across his face. Beneath it, you can see the gleaming, white, toothy grin of the man that acknowledges some sort of honor. “Then the trial shall commence. Come, within Cindergrove.” He turns around and heads back into the forest. The rest of the druids have stepped back now. They've left you to your own devices."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A vision of your death?\nMARISHA: Part of one of the ceremonies that the Earth tribe gives is called the Alore ceremony. It's a tea that they make that is derived from a local plant that– It's essentially a vision quest tea; it gives you visions. It's a cultural tradition, I guess. I saw two paths. One was an older woman, who was wise and hardened and brave, and she had a line of young Ashari behind her. And I ran away. I feel like she was me. And I ran away, and I went down another path. There was a tree. It was young, but strong, and it had a familiarity. As I reached out and touched it, my vision was taken through the path of the roots, and I could see the world, and I could see how everything was connected, and it took me to you all. And you were strong and fighting and proud, and then Vax yelled out, “This one is for Keyleth!” I wasn't with you. And then Grog yelled out, “This is for our princess!” And it broke away, and I realized that I was that tree, and it was my death. And as I ran to the other side, I went back to the old woman, and all of my people slowly started fading behind her, and as she looked at me, she said, “Your future is as important as it is fragile. Protect it.” And she, too, faded away. I realized she was me. And when I came out of my vision, I talked with the Earth Headmaster Patisse, and she told me that if I was going to survive, I needed to have the will to do what was necessary, and the strength. And ever since the child, it's been hard. I was there for a long time at the Earth Tribe, longer than most stay on their Aramente. I couldn't get through the trial; every time I used a natural magic, every time I tried to fight, I just saw flashes of that child's eyes. I was blocked. Normally, they save the Alore ceremony for the final testament, but they actually started me with the Alore ceremony in order to help hopefully unlock my spiritual blocking that I was having. But I don't know…\nORION: So what now, Your Highness?\nMARISHA: Continue on and hope I don't make a fatal mistake. Hope that I can learn.\nORION: We won't let that happen.\nMARISHA: I hope I don't let you guys down.\nTALIESIN: We face this together.","response":"DM: (explosion) There's another shake of the ground as you see another spray of molten rock, (spraying) and you hear pattering in the distance of the forest."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We'll do this together.\nTRAVIS: We're with you to the end.\nMARISHA: I love you all.","response":"DM: You all move together into the Cindergrove forest, pushing through the hardened, blackened tree trunks to the left and the right of you. The actual floor of the forest, what appears to be piles and piles of burnt-away brush, ash, and whatever else once was considered life amongst the boughs of these trees when they grew there. Eventually, you find your way to the center of the forest, and you can see now the source of these molten rock sprays. There is a large crevasse bisecting the center of the forest, about 35 to 40 feet across and about five feet wide that is a pool of slowly roiling lava. You can see the actual air around it is heavily warped by this intense heat that's being released, and all the trees that are immediately around it are all warped and bent and have been burnt to near lack of recognition. Standing there, amongst the edge of it, is Cerkonos with his arms crossed, trained on you, Keyleth. You see occasionally a couple of bubbles (lava bubbling) in the lava behind him, and even his form is shifting from behind as the air itself ripples and changes. He looks at you and says, “Sit. Focus. Ask permission.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I do as he says.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a wisdom check. Roll a d20. Add your wisdom bonus."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 27.","response":"DM: 27. As you sit down and close your eyes, you begin to focus your mind towards the center of this mountain, the heart of the fire that gives it its life, and as you all watch, a minute passes of silence before suddenly the ground shifts again and you can see the lava begin to grow more and more active, sending off little spittles of rock."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I push it out and continue to focus.","response":"DM: You guys begin to see now the lava is shifting and beginning to roil and you're almost afraid it's going to start bubbling over and fill the area, and this nervousness grips your heart. Especially you, Vax, who had previously had some unhappy run-ins with molten rock. It's a genuine fear that you hadn't quite acknowledged since that moment, and you begin to feel really uncomfortable being this close to this opening. As you continue to focus, you hear Cerkonos's voice again, calm and methodical. “Ask permission.” I'd like you to go ahead and roll a nature check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 19.","response":"DM: 19. (rock scraping) The ground shifts again. You can now watch the lava. Strangely enough, it's beginning to billow upward but not spill over the edges of the crevasse. It's actually slowly circling. You hear this strange sucking sound, almost like sludge is being pulled through a tube, and the lava beginning to slowly spin and spin. Cerkonos is still– the back of him you can only imagine is either burnt to a crisp by the sheer proximity of the heat, but he is unmoved."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I push it out and continue to focus. Just focus and meditate on asking permission.","response":"DM: “Keyleth of the Air Ashari. Ask permission!” Go ahead and roll one more wisdom check. d20 plus five. This time, with advantage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh my god, I rolled the same thing twice. Wisdom, five. 18.\nMARISHA: Before I leap down, I cast Protection from Flame on myself? Or Protection from Energy, and I'm going to use fire.","response":"DM: Which gives you fire resistance?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Gives me fire resistance.","response":"DM: Okay, good to know. And then… Keyleth?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I close my eyes and let myself fall.","response":"DM: You guys watch as Keyleth steps forward and tumbles off the edge, into the vortex of molten rock. (whoosh) She's gone."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I look to my sister and grab her by the shoulder and squeeze. Then I dive in.\nLAURA: Oh, shit. Are we doing this?","response":"DM: Make a wisdom saving throw, as this is fighting a very strong fear of yours."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Because we had the Heroes' Feast, are we not frightened?\nMARISHA: Oh my god, that's true. You have advantage on all of our wisdom saving throws, from the Heroes' Feast.\nLIAM: 16.","response":"DM: Okay. You shrug it off, and the thought of your sister, the thought of Keyleth, the thought of the moments of connection you guys have had, you push through that pain and you leap and swan dive into the vortex."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I cast Stoneskin. (whoosh)","response":"DM: You leap off. Tiberius dives in, as well. All of you guys jump in. You don't need to roll anything. It was only because of his fear he had to. The rest of you leap into this vortex."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket! Jump? Come. I smack him on the butt, and I jump in after him.","response":"DM: And Trinket (roaring) leaps in, looking over his shoulder at you like, what have you done?!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You're brave! Very brave!","response":"DM: As you all individually leap through, it's interesting. There's a falling sensation, and then gravity seems to shift. You're facing downward, but you feel gravity begin to pull you to the side, and your feet find purchase on what seems like the lava spiral, but it doesn't burn. You step on it like it's hard rock, shifting slowly beneath your feet, where you have to continuously change your step, like a slowly rotating tunnel you're walking through, and you're walking downward, downward, this way. And you see light before you, very bright light, and you move towards it and move towards it, and your eyes try and focus, and you cover your vision, and eventually you step out of this tunnel and it takes a moment for your eyes to focus, and looking around you, you see a vast barren wasteland of black cinders, embers, and ash, for miles and miles around you. Thin rivers of lava cut across the plains like blood splatter."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh my god, we're in the Plane of Fire.","response":"DM: The wind blows extremely strongly, and the atmosphere is dry and nearly unbearably hot, like the hottest desert you've ever imagined. An intolerably blazing sun is coming to rest near a distant mountain range, but your eyes catch an even more distant danger: a black, roiling cinderstorm a few miles off, red lightning flashing within its turbulent ash clouds. It looks to be moving away from you, thankfully, but you do indeed find yourself standing in the center of the Elemental Plane of Fire. A voice echoes from behind you, and you look over your shoulder, and you can see there is a circular doorway still held aloft there, shifting slowly, the vortex you stepped out of still locked in place. A voice says, “Stay together. Follow the footsteps. When you find the stone spire, there you will find your trial.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay…\nORION: Just to note: when I cast Stoneskin, I didn't do the concentration. I let go of the Alter Self.","response":"DM: Right. That was illusion dust, so it's fine."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, we follow footsteps; I can track footprints.\nMARISHA: Okay, sure. Yeah. He might mean more metaphorically. I'm not sure. It could be either. It's hard to tell. Can I sit and take a minute to meditate, and see if I can connect with my mother and see if I can find some sort of trace? Essence?","response":"DM: Make another wisdom check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And I want to use Primeval Awareness.\nMARISHA: I have advantage, right? I'll take that 15. Thank you. It was a one. So that's 28.\nLAURA: Can I use Primeval Awareness to see if there's any aberrations, celestials, elementals, fiends, undead? Any scary things? Dragons? Within six miles. No. A mile.","response":"DM: You sense there is a very, very faint comfort in this path, so you know it's been walked before. You're unable to glean anything beyond that, but you know you're on the right path, but your mother's been gone a long time. Surprising you've even caught wind of this type of an essence lingering."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Any direction of which way the essence might be blowing?","response":"DM: It's hard to tell. Make an investigation check. You sense within the mile– because it's not like blips on a radar, you just generally sense something nearby. In three different directions, elemental presence. Strong elemental presence. You glance up. Very strong elemental presence as all of you can see, about a quarter mile, half mile away, you see there's something drifting in the sky that is burning like a beacon."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What.\nMARISHA: It's a fire elemental.","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 16.","response":"DM: 16. Glancing about, trying to gather a sense of direction, you look and notice that there's no footsteps. There's no sign of any sort of stepping. The wind that blows through here, and there's a strong wind, and all of you are having to keep your eyes closed and arms up to try and block your vision from the wind. And it is a perpetual difficulty to even just breathe here. Every inhale burns the inside of your lungs."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! (pop)","response":"DM: There you go. Tiberius has a big old bottle in his mouth now. Like a magical pacifier, and you've got your mask on, which is helping. It is still very hot here, and under all the armor you're wearing, you immediately break into a very heavy sweat. You notice though that, through your investigation and the connection with your mother and the directional sense, while there are no tracks, there are small pools of lava that progress in a pattern, one that would even resemble footsteps of a giant or some sort of large creature."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Let's head that way. Let's follow this lava trail. Looks promising.\nTRAVIS: We're behind you.\nLAURA: (quietly) There's no way to stealth here, is there? Cover ourselves in ash or something to make us less visible?","response":"DM: What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it possible to cover us in ash and try to make us less visible to the elementals?","response":"DM: You can certainly try."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do you have Pass Without a Trace right now?\nLAURA: I do have Pass Without a Trace. I can cast that on us.","response":"DM: Okay. So you cast Pass Without a Trace on the group. As you do, the magic pools, a bunch of the ashes (whoosh) from the ground surround each of you, and there's this gentle cloud of ash that just tends to drift off your body and perpetually replace itself from the surrounding terrain. It does offer you some blanket of visual obscuring from any sort of high vantage point or distant vantage point. Up close, not so much. I'll have all of you guys roll a stealth check. With a plus ten bonus from the spell."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Cloak of Elvenkind is with advantage; would that take place here?","response":"DM: It would, yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 25.\nTRAVIS: 17.\nTALIESIN: 19.\nASHLEY: 23.","response":"DM: With the disadvantage? Because you have heavy armor on."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Let me do it again.\nTRAVIS: The feast thing? No?\nASHLEY: Natural 20.","response":"DM: But you still get the other one, which is still good."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Plus ten, 38.","response":"DM: (mocking) Oh, I'm such a rogue. What did you get?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 22.\nTALIESIN: 17.\nORION: 21.\nMARISHA: Do I get anything for having my protection from fire?","response":"DM: I'll say, give you advantage for this."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: My mask doesn't give me any advantage, does it?","response":"DM: Not for heat. This is the general atmospheric heat."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 11.\nLIAM: 13.\nTRAVIS: 20.\nASHLEY: 13.\nLAURA: That's pretty.\nMARISHA: That looks like a stone spire to me.\nTRAVIS: Well, it's shiny.\nMARISHA: It's rather shiny, yeah. Let's go there.\nLAURA: 17.\n(groaning)\nTALIESIN: Oh, sweet baby Jesus.\nLIAM: Oh, Jesus Ballsacks, who art in heaven.\nLAURA: No. Don't.\nTALIESIN: Does this make you feel better?\nLAURA: Oh no.\nMARISHA: (giggling) Yes.\nTALIESIN: God damn it, Wheaton.\nMARISHA: God damn it, Wheaton. Here.\nORION: Do you need me to light that on fire again for you?\nTALIESIN: No, it's going.\nMARISHA: Got to get my dice in order.\nTRAVIS: Oh my god, they're on fire. We have walls!","response":"DM: Broken, ruined walls that appear from the landscape. I need… some initiative scores from you guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Jeez Louise.\nLAURA: Oh no.\nTALIESIN: Crickets. Crickets have 25 to 20.","response":"DM: 20 to 15?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 19.\nORION: 15.\nLAURA: 18.\nLAURA: It's addictive, isn't it?\nLIAM: Yeah, it's fun to say. Thanks, bud.","response":"DM: 15 to ten?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 15.\nASHLEY and TALIESIN: Nine.\nASHLEY: Hi.\nMARISHA: Five!\nMARISHA: Five.\nTRAVIS: I rolled a one.\nMARISHA: He rolled a one, too.\nTALIESIN: We're sitting here like, is this a Cirque du Soleil thing?\nMARISHA: We're like, oh cool! It's fire.\nTALIESIN and MARISHA: Burning Man!","response":"DM: Top of the round, Cerkonos in his oversized fire elemental form darts forward towards the center (flame sounds). An unnatural pace of movement as the flames seem to flicker and dart and reform at the foot of the rest of the group, at which point he brings his arms in and (roaring flame) releases a torrent of flame that bursts out in a 20-foot radius from him, catching all of you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We have immunity to what, now?\nTRAVIS: She has immunity.\nORION: Hey! Internet! There's my natural one.\nLAURA and ASHLEY: No!\nORION: Suck it. It happens.\nTALIESIN: That's better.\nLIAM: Stealth. Dexterity. Damn it.\nTALIESIN: 15.","response":"DM: 15."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 23. No, 24.","response":"DM: Natural one."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 27.\nLAURA: 16.\nASHLEY: 18.\nTRAVIS: 16.\nASHLEY: Who rolled high?","response":"DM: Yep, who rolled high. 13 points of fire damage from the blast outward. Tiberius and Percy, you both take 25 points of fire damage–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I take half, right?","response":"DM: You take half, because of fire resistance."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How many points?","response":"DM: 25, and you are both set on fire as all of a sudden your clothing and armor (whoosh) burst into flames, and you are considered burning."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Burning?\nLAURA: How do you put yourself out?","response":"DM: You take an action to put yourself out."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Stop, drop and roll, man.","response":"DM: You have to basically take your action, your whole turn, trying to put the flames out. That ends Cerkonos's turn. Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Keyleth's right up against that elemental in front of her, right? I'm going to run right behind her–\nLAURA: You're on fire.\nLIAM: No, I'm not. I made the save. I click my boots together and I run up–","response":"DM: Did you roll for Trinket, as well? Go ahead and roll Trinket's roll. So you move up over here?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's good. Trinket definitely saved that.","response":"DM: What did Trinket make? You're behind?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right, so I'm going to swing up underneath Keyleth's arm, and then I've already clicked the boots, so dagger, dagger… dagger.\nTALIESIN: I like the comma there. The comma really brought it together.","response":"DM: Trinket takes 13 points of fire damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So 22 on the first.","response":"DM: 22 on the first? That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Third strike is a 19.","response":"DM: 19 does hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So three plus six, total of nine?","response":"DM: Total of nine points of fire damage. That ends your turn, Vax. Vex, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Can I back away from him, or am I going to get hit?","response":"DM: No, he does not have that far of a reach."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, so I back up. I'm going to back up against the wall so I can duck behind it if I need to, and I call Trinket with me, for sure. And then I am going to lightning arrow him? I'm going to lightning arrow– no. Jesus. I Hunter's Mark him!","response":"DM: There you go. He is Hunter's Marked."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Now he is surrounded by all of our friends?","response":"DM: Correct. He has three of them currently surrounding him."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Balls. I'm going to have to Hunter's Mark one of the little ones, then, and aim for one of them. And I'm going to Hail of Thorns them. The one closest to me.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's a 25!","response":"DM: 25 hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Plus Hunter's Mark damage. Six for Hunter's Mark, and then I get 3d10 for the Hail of Thorns.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, that's a ten, that's a ten, this is a ten. Balls. Ten, 12, 13. 13.\nLAURA: And just one more regular attack.","response":"DM: Okay. So it's a bonus action to do the spell, and then it's first attack hit, boom, second attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 20!\nMARISHA: Hot diggity.","response":"DM: So dice times two."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that's it? I know.","response":"DM: So two damage plus your bonus, plus your Hunter's Mark. Unless Hunter's Mark's once per turn; let me check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 14 for the second hit. That's a lame critical.\nLIAM: No, it was fantastic.\nORION: And I'm like, oh, that tickles. I don't expend an action to do that, and instead I look at the main dude and I'm going to be like, here's something she taught me. (babbling) And I use a scroll, and I'm going to cast Blight (magic sound) on him.\nMARISHA: I did teach him that.\nORION: I have two Blight scrolls. I'm reading super fast. (babbling)\nTRAVIS: Like a cattle auctioneer. (imitates auctioneer)\nORION: It's okay. I have something else that's effective.\nORION: It's 22.","response":"DM: 22, yeah. Not a problem. You take the spell, you pull out the scroll, read it, and the scroll itself you can see is starting to burn on its own just being pulled out in the heated atmosphere that is this Plane of Fire, but before it can burn entirely, you finish the spell. It disappears in a flash of light and ash, and then Blight goes and takes effect."}
{"prompt":"ORION: As I'm going to do that, I'm going to heighten it, and spend three sorcerer points so it gives him disadvantage–\nORION: Fair enough.","response":"DM: What's the DC on that?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17.","response":"DM: 17. Constitution. Rolled a 16, so no. Does not make it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So what I can do, is I can– if I can't heighten an initial spell, I can power a spell that's already been cast with my sorcerer's point, right? You can empower a spell?","response":"DM: True, but still spells that you've cast from yourself. The metamagic is how you enhance it as you cast it out of yourself. If it's from a scroll–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: (counting) 25 damage.","response":"DM: 25 damage. Good to know. Boom. You can see as you finish the scroll reading, some of the flames seem to die down and part of its physical form has a hard time keeping itself in one solid place. Parts of it flicker, and then it (growls) angrily pushes through."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Where am I relative to everybody else?","response":"DM: You're right here."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, cool. What I will do, because I can do this, is I will quicken spell, and I will spend two sorcery points to Misty Step behind where Vex is. (whoosh)","response":"DM: Over there?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yep. And in view of everybody else, where I can still cast stuff.","response":"DM: There? Okay. Cool."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's my turn.\nTALIESIN: That misses.","response":"DM: And that is a 25, with a 19."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 25 definitely hits.","response":"DM: Definitely hits, okay. You take 13 points of fire damage, and you are still on fire, so it does not reignite you. You are just on fire in general. That ends its turn. The other one, however, rushes up and it's doing a touch attack against Keyleth and Vex. Vax, I mean. Sorry. Versus Keyleth, that is a 16 versus armor class?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Miss. 17. (whoosh)","response":"DM: That's going to be a 20 versus you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That hits.\nLIAM: Oh, fuck a duck!","response":"DM: As you're like, shit, now the fire's crawling up around you. That brings us to Percy and Pike's turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I am on fire, aren't I?","response":"DM: Beginning of your turn, you take ten points of fire damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: God damn it. And it takes an entire action to put myself out? Can I run? He's going to get an attack of opportunity on me.","response":"DM: He would get an attack of opportunity on you if you ran, yeah, but also ranged attacks at point blank are at disadvantage, too."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. Fuck it. I'm going to run first, and then put myself out.","response":"DM: Okay. So you're running which way?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm running towards the wall. I'm getting some distance.","response":"DM: Over here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm doing a “stop, drop and roll” on my way to put myself out.\nMARISHA: Fire safety, kids.","response":"DM: Okay. The elemental reaches and strikes. That is a 21."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Damn it! Okay.","response":"DM: You take 12 points of fire damage as it just swings out and hits you in the back. You feel the flames now licking beneath your armor. You're sweating profusely and you feel the burn marks as the skin begins to boil and crack beneath the armor."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And you've moved me as far in that direction as I can go, right?","response":"DM: That would be over here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm also going to spend my bonus action for second wind, because fuck. So that's 19 points that I gain back.","response":"DM: That ends Percy's turn. Pike, what you got?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, Pike!\nASHLEY: Okay. So I have the Frost Brand Sword, so I'm resistant to fire damage if I'm holding it.","response":"DM: Correct. You have half damage from fire."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: But I would like to use a Guiding Bolt, because it's a little bit more damage.\nASHLEY: Okay. Let's do the guy right there. The big guy.","response":"DM: Big guy right there? Okay. Go ahead and roll your attack. You add your spell attack modifier to it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: That's only 15. 15?\nASHLEY: Yay! Okay.","response":"DM: That's 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack against it has advantage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice!\nASHLEY: 11.\nASHLEY: You know what, so sorry. I was casting that at a three.","response":"DM: As a level three? So add an additional 2d6 to it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah, sorry. 18.\nLIAM: Total.\nLAURA and ASHLEY: 18 total.\nASHLEY: Where am I at?","response":"DM: You're right here."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I look at Cerkonos, and give him a nod, and I say, okay. And I concentrate, and my entire form goes water, and I turn into a water elemental.\nLIAM: Skadoosh.\nTRAVIS: Badass.\nMARISHA: And then I immediately rush into Cerkonos's space, and do Whelm.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So he has to do a DC 15 saving throw.\nMARISHA: Strength.\nTALIESIN: We all look great and lose five pounds.\nLIAM: Everybody's glistening.\nTRAVIS: Our pores look better than they ever have.\nMARISHA: Sweat it out, guys.","response":"DM: He rolls a three."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So he does 2d8 plus four bludgeoning damage. I'm also water elemental, so I believe he has water susceptibility, correct?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't know what that does, but he's got it. So if it's a large or smaller creature, it is also grappled.\nMARISHA: 2d8. Not bad. 12 plus four. 16.","response":"DM: 16 damage, nice. And he is grappled, currently, as you are swirling around him as this vortex of water. As you hit for the attack, you do take six points of fire damage from being in the midst of that flame."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Does he take extra damage because I'm water? Because he has water susceptibility?","response":"DM: Water susceptibility, essentially, he takes one point of cold damage on top of that, and if he tries to moves away from you, he moves slower."}
{"prompt":"ORION: You're swirling water around him right now?\nMARISHA: It's water versus fire elemental right now.","response":"DM: However, because it is a fire elemental, it is immune to being grappled. Because it is just fire, you can't really grab around it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well, I just football tackle him. (impact) Water right through his form. Steam rolls off of me. (hiss)","response":"DM: And it is uncomfortable being in this plane as a water elemental, but you're pushing through it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I take how much? Four damage?","response":"DM: That was six damage. Which should be halved, because you have the resistance still on you, so that's three damage to you… You also entered its space, so you also are on fire. Strangely enough, you are a water elemental that's caught fire."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Water.\nTRAVIS: I look over, and I see as Vax starts slashing into the fire beastie, I know this is going to hurt, and I go into a rage. And I know I'm going to burn, but I take my three giant swings with my battleaxe.","response":"DM: So you're going into full frenzied rage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Frenzied rage. Frenzied rage, if you don't mind.","response":"DM: Certainly. Three strikes at him."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 24.","response":"DM: 24 hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 19.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And 24.","response":"DM: Hits. Damage on all three."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 11.","response":"DM: 11 damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 19.","response":"DM: 19 damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And 12.\nMARISHA: Hits.","response":"DM: So that would be 12 points of fire damage, reduced to six because of your spell, but you're not ignited."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Against everyone near him?","response":"DM: It's doing an attack against each of you. It's just reaching out. Cocked dice. That is 18 against you?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hell yeah, that hits.\nTRAVIS: Was that a crit?\nLAURA and LIAM: Yeah.\nLIAM: There goes that beard.\nTRAVIS: Oh, shut up! Don't tell him that!","response":"DM: 22 points of fire damage, and you are set on fire."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The beard is okay, right?","response":"DM: Currently, but the flames are licking up the sides of your shoulders."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, come on, man. Have you no mercy?\nLIAM: I made a stupid pun, and you tripped me and made me eat shit. Enjoy.","response":"DM: Cerkonos is going to stay there, just taking you all on at once. That brings us to Vax. To start your turn, you take nine points of fire damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Excellent. That's excellent news. I'm going to use my bonus action to disengage. I've got three things I can do here because of the Boots of Haste, so use bonus action to disengage. I'm going to use one action to run like fuck over to that wall and jump to the side.","response":"DM: It's not an attack. You have a bonus action and an action. So you can disengage and then move, then you have your action."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The other wall.\nLIAM: No, that wall.","response":"DM: Four, five, six. That'll put you right there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And then I'm going to roll on the ground.","response":"DM: Okay, you use your action to put out the flame."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (choked) It's okay, right? The cloak's okay?","response":"DM: The cloak's fine. It's a little burnt, but it's okay. The flames are gone now. You're no longer taking fire damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's my woobie.","response":"DM: That's your turn. Vex, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Hey, now. Not cool.\nLAURA: So that is 19?\nLAURA: Okay. So. Do I do my regular attack on that, as well, or do I just do the damage from the lightning?","response":"DM: No. The arrow is no longer there; it is now just a bolt of lightning halfway through the arc."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Correct. 4d8.","response":"DM: 4d8 damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is so nerve-wracking. (counting) 25 on the lightning arrow.\nTRAVIS: 18.","response":"DM: 18?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do I get advantage on that because I'm raging?","response":"DM: No. What's your spell DC?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, 14.","response":"DM: Okay, yeah. So he makes the save, go ahead and roll 2d8, and he takes half damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh. I didn't realize you were there, Grog. I'm sorry, I couldn't see.","response":"DM: Within ten feet of it. Every creature within ten feet of it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I didn't think that was ten feet. I'm sorry. Oh good, that's nothing. Two!","response":"DM: You take two points of lightning damage as (flicker) part of the lightning arrow arcs off and tickles your shoulder. You barely even notice, you're raged out and focused on him."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, with the being on fire, it's really not that bad.","response":"DM: Did Hunter's Mark damage on the last one, right?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes. 16 with Blood-Seeking.","response":"DM: Nice. So it's now bleeding."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's a bleeding fireball.","response":"DM: Interesting thing about this. I will consider bleeding as part of its conditional immunities, because it does not have blood. It is a flaming elemental."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Waste.","response":"DM: But it still took damage. You can see now, the flames of this are starting to flicker a little bit; it's having hard time keeping itself cohesive."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: On the smaller one?","response":"DM: Yeah. That ends your turn, do you want to move anywhere, you staying there?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to go around the back of the wall with Trinket. Oh no, I knocked it down on myself! Can I get around to the other side?","response":"DM: That's as far as you can get with your run right now, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, that's cool.","response":"DM: Okay, that ends your turn. Tiberius, you're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Don't worry about hurting me, if that's what you're afraid of.\nLIAM: Is that Draconic?","response":"DM: Hit all three of these guys? What's the arc on that one?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 30 feet?","response":"DM: 30-foot arc? Okay, you can get these two."}
{"prompt":"ORION: If I have to move, can I move closer to hit?","response":"DM: You'd have to get into melee with this to hit all three, which would be disadvantage if it's an attack roll."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Just take the two.\nORION: I'll take the two. I'll do that. And then, I'm going to spend three points to heighten the spell and that gives them disadvantage on their saving throw, so I'm going to do that right now.","response":"DM: So what's the saving throw? Dex?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17.","response":"DM: 17 dex. Okay, go ahead and roll damage, and it's half damage for that, right?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, if they save.\nTALIESIN: That's pretty good.\nORION: Ten, 18, what's that? 30, 35. 35.","response":"DM: 35. Okay. Keyleth and Grog also make dexterity saving throws."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Fair.","response":"DM: Two. Fails on Cerkonos."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 17.\nTRAVIS: 20.","response":"DM: That is a natural 17 for the fire elemental, though; it takes half damage there. So what's the total on there?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: And that was at disadvantage?","response":"DM: Oh, disadvantage. Natural 20. Sorry. Well, it still takes half damage. This elemental, you notice its form suddenly (cracking) freeze into ice, and then shatter."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're coming back.","response":"DM: What'd you roll? With disadvantage on the saving throw, guys, by the way."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Disadvantage?\nTRAVIS: That's worse. 14.\nMARISHA: Four.\nLAURA: No!","response":"DM: And that's a natural 18, plus six is 24. Welcome back."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: My armor class is 20, so they both hit me.","response":"DM: That's a natural 18 plus six on top of that."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Point taken!","response":"DM: Seven times two, that's 14 plus three. Take 17 points of fire damage from the first strike. The second one does… so 14 from both, so total of 28 points of fire damage, and you are ignited. All of a sudden, your armor heats up and you see flames begin to lick up through the different sections of the plate, and the fire elemental is harrying right on top of you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You first or me first?","response":"DM: Well, Percy, at the top of your turn– actually, you both take–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, I put myself out.","response":"DM: That's right!"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Take that soda can pop-topper off me.\nASHLEY: Oh no, wait! My Frost Brand sword. I'm resistant to fire damage!","response":"DM: Take 14 points of fire damage. You also take what would be four is now two, so a total of 16 points of fire damage."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 16 points, okay. Wait, so what was it?\nTRAVIS and LAURA: 16.\nLIAM: Reality is malleable here.","response":"DM: As the actual protective energies of the Frost Brand gives this layer of cold across your armor and reduces the impact. You're still on fire, but the fire is doing less damage to you physically as the cold is counteracting it. Cool. Percy, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, I'm pulling out the Pepperbox and I'm taking an ice shot at the little one attacking Pike. And I'm going to take a sharpshooter– that's the wrong dice to roll. I'm going to take a sharpshooter bonus for it, so that's a miss. That's a nine. Actually, no. Shit. God damn it, that's a misfire. I'm going to spend an action to fix that.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and roll the check on that, if you could."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, what is the check on that? That's a DC 12. Eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. I hit my check.","response":"DM: You just barely make it. The gun is not broken. As you spin, you go to fire, and something about the trajectory of the bullet is off, and as you release the trigger, all of a sudden the whole front of the barrel (cracking) encases in ice, and you're like, crap! And you have to chisel the ice off."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Fire again.","response":"DM: Well, it takes an action to try and–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, I looked. It takes an attack.","response":"DM: Then yes, you're able to do that."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: If it goes, then I'm–","response":"DM: Then it takes an action to fix it, that's what it is. Yeah, it's an action to fix a broken gun."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah. Action to fix a broken gun. Let's try it again without the sharpshooter bonus. Better! 20 to hit.","response":"DM: 20 does hit, yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And I don't get the bonus on that because I suck. Seven points of damage.","response":"DM: Seven points of damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Rolled a one.\nTALIESIN: And I'm going to back off.","response":"DM: Cannot use your attack again until an action. It is an action."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It is an action? I thought it was an action to–","response":"DM: It's an action to repair, and then if it breaks, you cannot use it until you're out of combat."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Did it break?\nTALIESIN: It did break.","response":"DM: It didn't break. It jammed, and then it managed to alleviate that."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I would have switched guns, anyways, but okay, next time. For some reason I thought it was an attack action.","response":"DM: No worries. That's the downside of the firearms. So no damage, you don't get your second attack off as you take your full action."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: To fix it, okay. That's fine; it was shitty damage anyways. Hey, I get to keep the bullet.","response":"DM: Cool, so that ends Percy's turn. Pike, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Percy, where are you at, in terms of hit points?\nTALIESIN: I'm fine. I'm at half. I'm at 56.\nLAURA: He's at 12.\nASHLEY: I know. He's at 12. Can I get over to Vax?","response":"DM: You'll not be able to get to him."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sprinter's Boots?","response":"DM: You could with your Sprinter's Boots, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Sprinter's Boots.\nTALIESIN: That was full road runner.\nASHLEY: 29.","response":"DM: So as Pike rushes up to you and touches you on the side of your waist, as you feel all your wounds and burn marks tend to subside and heal up instantaneously."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh yeah! That's good.\nASHLEY: That's a little bit of something.\nLIAM: Yeah! I'll take it.","response":"DM: That ends Pike's turn. Keyleth, you're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So plus seven to hit. So first one. 18, so that's 20. Okay. And second one. That's not as good. 19? Sorry, 18?","response":"DM: 18 also hits."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Cool. So that's 2d8 plus four bludgeoning damage, twice. So that's five, six. So that's ten. Nine, plus another 13. 23 points of damage.","response":"DM: 23 points of damage. Your attacks in this form are considered magical, correct? So yeah, it doesn't do half damage. It's full damage, because normally it would have resistance to bludgeoning. But because of your magical weapons, because you're a crazy druid, full 23 points of damage. As all of a sudden the elemental form starts slamming him with these giant tidal wave-like fists–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, plus an extra two because I'm a water elemental.","response":"DM: There you go. (wham, wham) You can see, steam is starting to billow off of Cerkonos's elemental form. They're both in this crazy tidal, epic elemental throw down. This is WWE style."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh no. It must be stopped!","response":"DM: Are you going to stay where you are?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, I'm on his ass.\nTRAVIS: Can I move around the backside of him without him getting an attack of opportunity if I stay just as close as I am now? No?","response":"DM: As soon as you dart off to the side, he'll get a strike on you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!\nTALIESIN: Can he do a one-space move without an attack?\nTRAVIS: Just because I'm cooking– fuck it, I'll keep swinging. I'm in a frenzied rage.","response":"DM: Go for it. Three strikes against Cerkonos."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's a 20.\nLIAM: Natural 20?\nTRAVIS: Oh no, a total of 20. 19.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And a 22.","response":"DM: Hits. All three hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 11. 17. And a 19.","response":"DM: 19. (whacks) Once again, streaking into him, mouth open (roars). The foam that would normally be gathering at the side of your mouth though is just this dried crust on the side, because there's just all this heat in the air. With each yell, as you close your mouth, you can taste the ash that is coalesced on the back of your tongue, it's this terrible smell. It would bother you if you weren't so focused in your furied rage in this vicinity. However, you do take three points of fire damage, two points of fire damage, and ten. So a total of 15 points of fire damage from striking at it with your axe as the fire blows back onto you. Also, at the top of your turn because you were on fire, you took another eight points of fire damage from the flames burning and licking up your shoulders. You smell the scent of burning hair reach your nostrils."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's because we're family.\nLIAM: It could be your pubes! Don't jump to conclusions!","response":"DM: That ends Grog's turn. Hold on, that your turn? At the top, Cerkonos is going to angrily now go into three more attacks. One against Keyleth, two against Grog, because Grog's starting to look a little rough, and the flames are affecting him more than it's affecting Keyleth. He turns to slam you twice. That is a 26?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That'll hit.","response":"DM: Nine plus eight. That is a 17?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Misses.","response":"DM: 19 plus eight, that's a 27."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know if that hits or not.","response":"DM: I'm sorry, that one's against Keyleth. So one hits you, one misses, and the last one was 27 versus you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah…","response":"DM: So you take 11 points of fire damage from the strike. You take ten points, reduce that to five. So you take five points of fire damage. That is Cerkonos's turn. That brings us to Vax."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so Cerkonos is still busy with Keyleth, so I'm going to take a split second to inhale, exhale, and then (dagger noises) right from where I am. So 18.","response":"DM: 18 hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 14.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Natural 20 for the third. Do I get to pick which one is the–? Okay, so the first one hit, which is sneak attack, so that is four plus seven is 11, plus– 14, 17, 23, 25– 31 for the first hit. Second one, which was a hit, is– which part gets doubled?","response":"DM: Just the dice roll."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The dice roll. Four plus six is ten.\nLIAM: That's it. Yeah, that's it. I'll back up against the side of that wall that's right there. But that's it.","response":"DM: Okay. Vex."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I come around the side of the wall. Hi! Oh hey. And I shoot at the other guy.\nLAURA: Is he within ten feet of anything?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Then I'm going to Lightning Arrow– I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.\nLAURA: Yes, so I'm going to Hail of Thorns him.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes. 15?","response":"DM: 15? That does hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes! 17, plus four, so that's 21, plus 3d10. 14.\nLAURA: Take two! That one doesn't hit, though.","response":"DM: What was that?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 13.","response":"DM: 13 just hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yay! 16. 20.\nORION: And I turn to the fire elemental because they're coherent, right? I'm like, do you really need me to do this? I ask it the question.","response":"DM: Currently, the elemental is just in the middle of– it's just an amorphous flaming mass."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's like one of those creatures at a gas station.\nORION: Fine, so I go, Glacial Blast! With my finger. (hiss)","response":"DM: Okay. For its saving throw, it rolls an 18. What's your DC on that?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17.","response":"DM: So half damage. Go ahead and roll for the targeted blast."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 14.\nMARISHA: 14, 17, 18, plus six, so it's 24, plus another eight, so that's 32.\nORION: 32.","response":"DM: 32 points of ice damage reduced to half, because of that, so it takes 16 points of ice damage and would be grappled, if it wasn't immune to being grappled. As the ice encases around it, its fire form flicks out from underneath the ice and keeps itself fluid and moving."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I will use two sorcery points to quicken a spell and use my cantrip Control Flame to (whoosh) start juggling the flame that I was caught on fire with.","response":"DM: And with that, Tiberius, you gather the fire off of your body– I'll say you are no longer on fire, as your Control Flame has pulled the fire from your torso and you're now just tossing it around in the middle of the Elemental Plane of Fire."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Would somebody end this, please?","response":"DM: The elemental's turn. It turns angrily towards you, trying to shoot it constantly with the ice blast. Rushes forward (whoosh) with immediate speed, darts up in front of you, attacking twice. That is a two, so that misses. That's a total of eight. And 19?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's a what?","response":"DM: 19."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's a 19? I'm going to spend a grit point and say that doesn't hit.","response":"DM: Gunslinger's dodge?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yep, I'm going to Gunslinger's dodge.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to unload into its body. I know I'm at a disadvantage because I'm that close, but I'm just going to unload into its body.","response":"DM: So three attacks at disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Three attacks with disadvantage.\nMARISHA: Was that a 20?\nTALIESIN: That was a 17, but it's okay, because I have disadvantage, so that's a 21.","response":"DM: Hits. Second one?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 17.","response":"DM: Hits. Third one?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 26.\nORION and LIAM: (gunshots)","response":"DM: So three shots against it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 18, plus 23, 26. 35 points of damage.","response":"DM: 35 points of damage. (gunshots) As each one blasts through, the elemental form shimmers, and you can see now the druid left there in its space. Lands on its knees, looks up at you, and gives you a quick little smile. At this point, you guys hear (roaring flames) this rolling, crumbling, angry, fiery sound as you glance over and you can see the cinderstorm is nearly upon you at this point in time. At this juncture, you guys can continue to fight if you want to, but you can see Cerkonos is looking over and looks at the rest of you. “We should go. Now.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yes.\nLAURA: Did you complete the mission?\nMARISHA: I slowly release him down from my water elemental form.","response":"DM: As he touches down, he immediately (poof) turns into a giant eagle, swoops and grabs you, Pike, (gripping sound) and heads towards the exit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I guess it's time to go.\nORION: I think we should go, yes.\nMARISHA: I drop my– no. I'm going to keep in my water elemental form.","response":"DM: Okay. What's the speed on it?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 30.\nMARISHA: Okay, I lied. I drop my elemental form. I go ahead and I'm going to cast Gust of Wind ahead of us to try and make a tunnel and try and air this heat down.","response":"DM: Okay. That helps a little bit and gives you guys a little more leeway as you're pushing forward. The storm blows over you entirely, and darkness comes in. It feels like you're in the center of a cloud. There is light, somewhat, but your vision is obscured about five feet ahead of you and you think you're heading in the right direction towards the portal. You can see roughly, as Cerkonos is carrying you through the storm, I need everyone to go ahead and make a constitution check."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Could I do a Mass Cure Wounds before I go? Because I was going to do that right last minute.","response":"DM: You currently are being held aloft, and you can't see the rest of your party, unfortunately. You can ask him to drop you, if you want."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm reaching out and clasping Vex's hand as we run forward.\nMARISHA: What are rolling?\nTALIESIN: Constitution check.\nASHLEY: All of us?\nMARISHA: That's not too bad.\nTALIESIN: Okay! 21.\nMARISHA: 22.\nORION: 19.\nLIAM: Ten.\nLAURA: Nine.\nASHLEY: Five.\nTRAVIS: 13.\nMARISHA: Aw, we were the happy table.","response":"DM: You guys keep pushing forward. For you guys, the sheer amount of heated ash that is starting to pour into your lungs, even though Keyleth is keeping a tunnel ahead of you–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I use my stone's endurance?","response":"DM: You can, yes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay. Shit.\nASHLEY: I'm going to ask him to drop me, and I'm going to do a Mass Cure Wounds.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh fuck, how high am I?","response":"DM: You don't know."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and MARISHA: No, don't do it, Pike!\nASHLEY: He's dying!\nTRAVIS: No, I'm okay. I got back 19 points.","response":"DM: Okay. You shrug off that damage. You don't heal past it, you just shrug off that damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay, good.","response":"DM: So you take no damage from that."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh. That's good.","response":"DM: So. As you guys are racing forward, the storm is still blowing and you can hear Cerkonos shouting as a hawk, adding this beacon of noise as you guys are trying to follow suit. Since you're leading the way, Keyleth, I want you to go ahead and make a survival check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I was going to say, can I use my wanderer ability where I think I get– my survival ability? I think I get advantage?","response":"DM: I'll give you advantage on this survival check. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Please. That's much better! Okay. 14. No, don't– sorry, I rolled a 14. 24!","response":"DM: 24. You're able to keep a focused direction on both where Cerkonos is going and keeping a connection to where that portal was you guys stepped through to get to this elemental plane. As you're pushing forward, you find yourself not getting lost in this darkened storm, thankfully. Slowly ahead of you, Keyleth, you see what looks like the slowly rotating portal that you guys stepped through."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We're almost there!","response":"DM: Everyone once again make a constitution save."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hold on!\nLAURA: Which one?\nTALIESIN: Yes!\nLAURA: That's good. That was better!\nTALIESIN: 21.\nMARISHA: 13.\nORION: 14.\nLIAM: 14.\nLAURA: 18.\nASHLEY: Eight.\nTRAVIS: 19.\nTRAVIS: Can I use a hit dice to heal myself at all?","response":"DM: You need a short rest to get there. You guys make your way to the outskirts of the portal and you leap through, as one by one, you all jump into this portal, the druids following behind. The sense of falling becomes this jettison motion as you are shoved and thrown into the air, out of the portal, and landing about 15 feet, 20 feet from the fall. I need all of you guys to make an acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, you bastard.\nTALIESIN: Can I use my saving throw reroll that I get?","response":"DM: It's a skill check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's a skill check? Damn it. Okay.","response":"DM: So. Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Six.\nLAURA: Pike, what'd you roll?\nASHLEY: 16.\nLAURA: One!\nLIAM: 25.\nORION: One!\nMARISHA: 19.\nTALIESIN: 12.\nASHLEY: Mass Cure Wounds? 33.\nLIAM: What about my sister and Tibsy?\nTRAVIS: Everybody gets 33 points.","response":"DM: Oh, you guys managed to catch yourself, and don't take any damage as you land on your feet."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Because they rolled a one.","response":"DM: Oh, you rolled a one?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Me and Tiberius rolled ones.","response":"DM: Oh, I thought you rolled a one. I'm sorry. You take the three damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that's it? Well. It's easy to get us confused though because we look so similar.","response":"DM: That is true."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 33, guys.\nTALIESIN: 33.","response":"DM: As the lava vortex closes, you can see the cinderstorm that's been billowing out like a giant stack of black smoke and burning embers slowly fades away, the portal closing off entirely. As the molten rock pool comes to rest, Cerkonos is now standing out, covered in soot like the rest of you, and he steps forward and releases his hand out towards Keyleth, as you're sitting on the ground from the fall. Lifts you up to your feet. Looks you in the eye. “You. You have the blessing of the Pyrah behind you.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, Keyleth!\nTALIESIN: Bravo!","response":"DM: “Go forth and continue your Aramente knowing we acknowledge your wisdom and ability.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thank you, Cerkonos. Brother.","response":"DM: He reaches his hand out and clasps it. Lifts you to your feet. At this point he turns and nods to one of the nearby druids. The druid steps forward, presenting a black orb about that big of blackened rock that has red veins of pulsing energy arcing through it like a bolt of lightning locked in a single moment in time. “This is a spark stone, rare within the realm you just escaped. We've harvested but a handful over generations, and few have returned with them. This one  is yours, Keyleth. To use yourself, or bequeath to an ally. When crushed by the hands of one, their fists shall burn with the fury of an efreet.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: For how long?","response":"DM: “For as long as you wish.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Forever!","response":"DM: “The choice is yours, who this blessing is given.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thank you. This is a great honor.","response":"DM: “Well. You're welcome to stay as long as you wish before you must continue on your journey.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I think a rest might be in order. I'm exhausted.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. You think they have graham crackers and little bits of chocolate with marshmallow?\nMARISHA: Oh, to make s'mores? That's a great idea.\nASHLEY: That's a good idea.\nLAURA: And also a lot of water.\nTALIESIN: Water would be lovely.\nMARISHA: Do you have water, Cerkonos?\nORION: I have water! (spraying)","response":"DM: At which point, water begins spewing forth from this vial that Tiberius has. (spraying) All this steam is rising up as it hits the ground, the heat from the vicinity–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's mainly for drinking and such, but are we all done?\nMARISHA: I bow to him, and I salute, and I say, Kaitiakè, brother.","response":"DM: “Kaitiakè, princess.” And he turns around and steps back towards the forest."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Your people are fucking sweet.\nMARISHA: Thank you.\nORION: Yes, I rather enjoyed that environment myself.\nASHLEY: What does kaitiakè mean?\nMARISHA: It is sort of our salute. It means “guardian” and “brethren.” It's a high salute.\nLAURA: (mispronouncing) Kaitiakè.\nMARISHA: Kaitiakè.\nLAURA: Kaitiakè.\nLIAM: And not tomorrow please, but where do you need to go next for this quest of yours?\nMARISHA: Well, my last stop would be to the Water Ashari. In Aquas. Back on another continent.\nTRAVIS: Well, that's good. I don't think we could take another one right now, anyway.\nMARISHA: No, I don't think we could. I'm doing pretty good, actually. I'm ahead of schedule.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, please.","response":"DM: We'll say for the sake of brevity, as it is getting rather late, and which for all of you guys watching, consider this lengthy episode a gift for the fact that we won't be doing this next week because some of us will be out of town. But you rest for a bit. You eventually find your way back down to the base of the mountain range. Your horses have not been touched, although they are a little hungry. An uneventful journey, make your way back to Vasselheim, where over the past six or seven days of travel, Pike, you come to find the curse has been lifted from the temple of Sarenrae, and your followers, as they are now calling themselves, though you had not expected to become this beacon of light to these worshipers who had no central focus or entity to guide them in their worship, you've become a very important figure to them, and they welcome your return to the temple."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (quietly) Oh, but I don't want to go back.\nASHLEY: What if I want to stay?","response":"DM: Then talk to the producers of Blindspot."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're an important figure to us as well, Pickles.\nASHLEY: Pickles.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, you've done so much for our lives. Maybe you continue to do good in these lives?\nASHLEY: Well… debatable.\nTRAVIS: You can leave them anytime, and we'll kick their ass so you can come back.\nLAURA: Any moment at all.\nASHLEY: This was so great, being a part of your journey that you had.\nORION: You are always part of our journey, no matter where we go, Pike.\nTRAVIS: Just keep the poo close.\nMARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.\nLAURA: I mean, I don't know what it does exactly.\nMARISHA: We have a good feeling about it.\nLIAM: Just put your faith in Sarenrae.\nASHLEY: Okay. Well, I guess I'll go.\nLAURA: (choked sob noise)\nASHLEY: Kaitiakè.\nLAURA: Explosions!\nLIAM: Tatonka.\nTRAVIS: Tatonka, yeah!\nORION: I'm sorry, but Tiberius runs up and squeezes Pike, one more time.\nASHLEY: Hugs and loves.\nORION: You're my favorite gnome.\nASHLEY: Oh, thanks. You're my favorite– everything, I guess.\nASHLEY: Dragonborn.","response":"DM: Pike turns and returns towards the excavation of the long-lost temple of Sarenrae, you all give her–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It hurts every time, Pike.\nTRAVIS: We'll see you soon.\nASHLEY: Oh, okay.","response":"DM: And Keyleth, you have the boon of the spark stone to gift to whoever or whatever you see fit."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do I know what it does? Can I do like a check on it?","response":"DM: Best you can ascertain, looking at it, is once the stone is crushed, the hands of whatever creature crushes it become bequeathed with the flame of the elemental plane itself."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Interesting.\nLIAM: That would be good for anybody.\nASHLEY: Can she use it? Well, she already has that.\nMARISHA: I'll keep it safe.","response":"DM: You can keep tabs on it. It doesn't affect a weapon if you're holding it. It's only physical attacks like punches, claws, anything like that are affected by the flame."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Could be cool for Grog. Boxing.\nTALIESIN: Would it enchant anything in animal form?\nMARISHA: Oh, claws? You said claws?","response":"DM: Yeah. So an animal form of yours, Trinket, anyone like that would have flames on their forearms."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Maybe we'll wait until something is negated.\nLIAM: Sleep on it.\nTRAVIS: Fuck that place.\nLAURA: That's awful. Thank god that dragon didn't freaking attack us.\nTRAVIS: They don't sell any timeshares there, I gather.\nTALIESIN: Oh, and if you're in Denver I will be at– is it Nan Desu Kan? I'm blanking. I'll be in Denver at Nan Desu Kan, so you can go see me in Denver.","response":"DM: That's awesome. And some of you guys are going to be at–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're going to be at SacAnime next week. The three of us.\nTRAVIS: The two twins and the handsome one.\nLAURA: And I'm going to be at PAX tomorrow and Saturday, so I'm leaving tomorrow morning to head up to Seattle. Go say hi. We're doing a crowdplay of Tales from the Borderlands on Saturday night. You should come.","response":"DM: That's going to be fun."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So tune in next week for Chalk Talk with Tiberius.\nMATT and LIAM: Yes!\n[end of transcription]","response":"DM: Pike left back there to finish up the renovation of the temple of Sarenrae that was discovered. The rest of the party moved on back to Emon, the rest of their business complete. Within Emon, they returned to Greyskull Keep, where they encountered a fan, apparently, of Vox Machina, that had been camping for two weeks outside, who was promptly bludgeoned in the temple by Vax to teach him a lesson. Brought back from the brink, and taught that hard lesson-- that this is a dangerous field-- managed to seemingly reach out and touch the heart of this young, intrepid, wannabe adventurer to possibly try and better himself before he throws himself into danger's way. And he ran off to train harder."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Dagger, dagger, hug.","response":"DM: Indeed. Upon returning to the keep, notice was sent off to one of the other members of the Council of Tal'Dorei, Seeker Asum, who is the halfling head of whispers and all sorts of subterfuge across the countryside, who came to you notifying you that within a week's time, the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, are supposed to be arriving here within Emon for a feast to discuss building a bridge and a more political joining between Emon, the Tal'Dorei royal family, and these up-and-coming lords and ladies, who have a very dark history with Percy's character. You've been asked to join as part of this feast as you previously requested with sovereign Tal'Dorei, that should anything involved the Briarwoods that you be included. You have a week to figure out what you want to do in advance of that. And that is where we left off."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What time of the day is it?","response":"DM: Right now, after this discussion, you guys' arrival, I'd say it's probably mid-afternoon. First things first, though, after this discussion with Seeker Asum, who leaves the keep, you do have a brief moment of awkward silence as most of the people that work within your keep turn to you. Laina looks about the rest of you and goes, \"By the way, we've been working here for about six weeks on the pay of four. We're coming close to our next pay scheme, and you tend to leave often and for extended periods of time. We would also like to be paid, if possible.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Most definitely, dear. Yes. We are definitely going to pay you. Does anybody remember how much we are supposed to pay them?\nORION: Pardon, what is the total of the staff's payment?","response":"DM: She thinks to herself for a moment, at which point you see Erwen, the elderly servant in the back says, \"Actually, you had previously said it was both of our services was 50 gold each for the month. And if I recall, the other mercenaries or guardians that you've hired to watch the walls of the keep were at a discussed 100 gold for the month's wages. Each.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And how many of those guys do we have?","response":"DM: \"You currently have five on your payroll, yes. 600 gold pieces total per month for the services for everyone keeping your keep.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Tell you what, I will front this from my personal funds for this month. Just because we don't have enough in the party funds to cover that.\nSAM: We don't have 600 gold?\nLAURA: We do not!\nSAM: Who's our treasurer?!\nLAURA: I am, but you bitches keep spending money!\nLIAM: I'll go halfsies.\nLAURA: Halfsies? Lovely. Twinsies will pay halfsies. Here you go! 300 for each.","response":"DM: \"Thank you so much. I'll make sure this gets to the appropriate individuals immediately. They'll be very happy to not have to walk away. \""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, don't worry, you will always be paid from Vox Machina.","response":"DM: Erwen steps in. \"And by the way, if you do intend to leave for an extended period of time again, I would recommend perhaps paying that in advance. There was a bit of unrest last time.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Should we pay another month?\nLAURA: Not yet. Not just yet.\nORION: I'll pay him in advance right now, just to get it out of the way. 600, out of here, phew, there you go.","response":"DM: \"Very well, sire! I shall disseminate this amongst the others.\""}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Traditionally, the head of the house does dispense out the stipends anyway. That would be appropriate. I'm not even in the room, am I? Never mind! Sorry.","response":"DM: Yeah, you're down in the workshop."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I go find Percy?","response":"DM: You can."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Actually, we should all go find Percy. We should all talk to Percy.","response":"DM: \"Thank you kindly, Tiberius. Thank you.\" And he wanders off and begins counting out change into a smaller purse."}
{"prompt":"ORION: When they start to go, I'd like to go to the temple with the sigils and talk to the guy who runs the place.","response":"DM: Oh, you mean the Lyceum?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, the Alabaster Lyceum."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, because I learned something new this week and I was like, I'm dumb. But that's where I would like to head.\nTRAVIS: What are you doing, Percy? You making more mousetraps? Guess not.\nTALIESIN: I'm a bit busy. I am making more ammo. I'm working on a few projects that have been rolling around in my head for quite some time now.\nORION: (whispers) Don't forget the bolt.\nTALIESIN: The bolt is on the list, yes.\nLAURA: Quite the worker.\nTALIESIN: I've got a lot to do.\nLAURA: Yes. Darling...\nTALIESIN: How many of you are down here right now?\nTRAVIS: I think we're all here. I'm moving through his stuff.\nLAURA: I let Trinket forage around the courtyard, so he's not down here at the moment.\nLIAM: I think we need a little history lesson here--\nTALIESIN: Grog, don't touch that!\nTRAVIS: Why not? But it moves!\nLAURA: Don't touch anything.\nORION: Matthew, I took some fine meats before I left and I'm feeding them to Lockheed along the way.","response":"DM: Okay. Lockheed enjoys them thoroughly. They're delicious. Comfort food crafted by the finest of cooks in Greyskull Keep."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Percy, it's hard not to clearly notice that you're quite distressed, and we're concerned. And you know, we were talking about it-- not that we were talking about you or anything, behind your back or anything-- but we never really found out why you were in that prison cell when we found you.\nLIAM: We've never questioned it before. We've never wanted to make you uncomfortable. But we're about to walk into a party, and I feel like we need a bit of a history lesson.\nTALIESIN: Ugh. I know you're right. (sighs)\nTRAVIS: Should we guess? Was it public nudity?\nTALIESIN: A bit. I've never had to say this out loud before. I've never actually had this discussion with anyone.\nSAM: It's okay. It gets better.\nTALIESIN: Do I get an inspiration die for that?","response":"DM: I'll give you a d6 inspiration die."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You know her name, but you've never seen her before?\nTALIESIN: I saw her when she was interrogating me in my home.\nSAM: Oh, so you could recognize her.\nTALIESIN: Oh yes.\nLAURA: How did you get away when they-- with the rest of your family?\nTALIESIN: My sister Cassandra, my younger sister. She somehow evaded capture. I don't know how. She set me free. I don't know what became of her. I don't know what became of any of my siblings. Probably nothing reasonable. Nothing good.\nLIAM: You witnessed none of these deaths?\nTALIESIN: I saw bodies of a few of them. It's all a bit shady. It's all a bit of a blur.\nSAM: How many years ago was this?\nTALIESIN: (sighs) Four now. Five now.\nLAURA: If you know that they murdered your family, how are they still part of society?\nTALIESIN: I don't know. (sighs) I could have gone home. I could have gone home at any point, at this point. I'm scared.\nMARISHA: Did they take over Whitestone? Are they still there?\nTALIESIN: I discovered approximately a week ago that they're still at Whitestone.\nLAURA: Will they recognize you?\nTALIESIN: I don't know.\nTRAVIS: And these pricks are in good standing with the council?\nTALIESIN: (sighs) I don't know what to do. I'm preparing for anything. When I got thrown into that dungeon, I came to the realization that maybe I wasn't doing this the right way. I wasn't being responsible, and I prayed to whatever it is I pray to that maybe I would have a sign of what I should be doing, and then there you were. I've been trusting that Vox Machina will take me where I need to go, and maybe what I need to do is confront this, but I don't know what this is, and I'm terrified.\nLIAM: And the remains of your family, were they killed by the sword?\nTALIESIN: I don't know. There was an interrogation. Dr. Ripley was asking questions. I assumed, for all these years, that that's what became of my family.\nMARISHA: What was she asking questions about? What did they want? Was it just a political coup?\nTALIESIN: Asking questions about the castle, about things about the castle. It was a long time ago, and I was not equipped for torture. I don't remember much.\nTRAVIS: Do you want them dead?\nTALIESIN: I think so.\nLAURA: Should we interrogate them first? Find out more about your family?\nTRAVIS: Or just skip ahead to the dead part?\nTALIESIN: I put down my gun, and I turn the barrel, and of the six barrels, five of them have names, and Lord and Lady Briarwood are two of those names. Dr. Ripley is another.\nSAM: What are the other ones?\nTALIESIN: Sir Stonefell is the other, and Professor Anders is the other, and then there's one blank one.\nLAURA: Are they all members of the same party? They travel with the Briarwoods?\nTALIESIN: I don't know.\nMARISHA: Wait, what were the names? The Briarwoods, Ripley, Sir Kerrion Stonefell. Who is he?\nTALIESIN: He was the captain of their guard.\nMARISHA: And Professor Anders? Who's that?\nTALIESIN: Professor Anders was my teacher. He was my tutor, and he was in collusion with them, and he was the one that I believe allowed them to take the castle in the night.\nMARISHA: And do you remember why they were invited to Whitestone to begin with?\nTALIESIN: They were traveling. They were on the road. It was my brother Julius and my sister Vesper who handled matters of court. I was studying. I didn't think.\nMARISHA: And how many brothers and sisters do you have?\nTALIESIN: I had six.\nLAURA: You might have six. We don't know what happened to them.\nMARISHA: You said you saw a few bodies of family?\nTALIESIN: It's all very much a blur. (sighs) There's things you just forget.\nSAM: Well, this is certainly tragic, but looking forward, what do we know of this meeting? Event? Party? What are we doing?\nLAURA: Well, I think we need to do some spying.\nSAM: Well, do they know Percy's among us?\nLAURA: That's the thing. I don't know if they do.\nTALIESIN: You don't have to get involved in this.\nLAURA: Oh, we are so involved.\nLAURA: We've got your back, darling.\nLIAM: Percival, you don't really have a choice in the matter. My sister and I know a little piece of your pain. I'm not going to get into it, but there's nothing she and I can do. We can find reparations for you. We will.\nMARISHA: Percy, is this what you want?\nTALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nSAM: And if we kill them, how much will you pay us? Just kidding. We ask other people that.\nLAURA: Something I do need to know. Percy. If we see them, and we're not ready to show our faces, will you be able to contain yourself?\nTALIESIN: I think so.\nMARISHA: And would they be able to recognize your face?\nTALIESIN: Which is why I was planning on-- I know we have a cap of disguise.\nTRAVIS: Oh! We do.\nLAURA: Scanlan has it.\nTALIESIN: I don't even know if they would recognize me. My hair was different.\nLAURA: Less purple?\nSAM: We could go into town, and find you a bushy mustache. It's worked for me many times.\nTALIESIN: I don't think I wear one as well as you do.\nLIAM: How does that cap work?\nSAM: Well, that cap is more of a hat. While wearing this hat you can use an action to cast Disguise spell. Oh. Cast a Disguise spell? Do you have to be a spellcaster to use it?","response":"DM: You do not have to, no."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.\nTRAVIS: I see a shiny tool. I don't know what it does.","response":"DM: You reach over and grab it, and it's a large set of tongs, used for gripping large, heavy pieces of metal, either for the actual forge itself, or to bend and manipulate on the workbench."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I take it (yawns) and put it in the Bag of Holding.","response":"DM: Make a sleight of hand check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Stealing from the workshop that you partially own?\nTRAVIS: There are lots of cool stuff in there! What was the check?","response":"DM: Sleight of hand."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Where's sleight of hand-- 17!\nLAURA: My passive perception is 21.\nTALIESIN: No, this could be funny, let this happen.\nLAURA: I give him the evil eye.","response":"DM: She gives you the evil eye."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It hurts. I put it back.\nTALIESIN: Out of curiosity, what did you pick up, what did it look like?\nTRAVIS: It was a big thing of tongs. I didn't know what it did, I just wanted it.\nTALIESIN: A big thing of tongs? What would I have to roll to find out if it was covered in some basic sulfuric acid? If it was one of the things I was using for casting.","response":"DM: Ah, interesting. You know your tools very well in your workshop, and yeah, the metal is scarred and pockmarked from use with the various corrosive chemicals."}
{"prompt":"(gasping)\nORION: Stupid.\nLAURA: You're not there.\nSAM: Well this Hat of Disguise, Percival, it requires some attunement. I don't know how capable you are with magical items.\nTALIESIN: I can find out.\nLIAM: We got seven days. I can make you look like anything. I can talk to the right people and get you the right paperwork and you can be anyone and no one will know a fucking difference.\nMARISHA: Calm down there.\nTALIESIN: I can forge paperwork, as well.\nLAURA: Oh yes, he can. He's actually the guy we go to.\nMARISHA: He is that guy you meet on the corner of Sandy Alley.\nSAM: I can make us all into birds.\nTRAVIS: Are we supposed to go meet with the council right away?\nTALIESIN: No, in a week.\nSAM: What do we do in the week? Prepare. Recon?\nLAURA: We can do things. How long of a ride is it to Kraghammer?","response":"DM: To Kraghammer, on horseback? It's about two and a half days."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Solo style, if you're fast, and back?","response":"DM: Fast and back? I'd say just under two days, probably."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How about the giant eagle flies?\nMARISHA: Yeah, what if you're flying?","response":"DM: I'd say, well, the horse is probably a little bit faster than the eagle."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But you don't have to stick to the road as an eagle.","response":"DM: I'd say it'd put you there about the same pace, about two days on eagle, because you can just go straight through. I mean, you want to take the road because you know that there's a lot of dangerous things that wander the wild that are between there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What do you think? Is it stupid to go and ride hard and try to get there and back before--?\nSAM: Wait, we're going to get cash and come back?\nLAURA: We don't all have to go. A couple of us can make a fast ride.\nMARISHA: Tiberius is working on it, I have a feeling deep down inside.","response":"DM: You know I deduct points for metagaming."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I didn't do anything!\nTALIESIN: I agree we should send someone for the money. I agree.\nSAM: And it won't take us a whole week to prepare for this party. All we need is a couple disguises.\nMARISHA: Yeah, but we need to do research. You barely know who the Briarwoods are.\nLIAM: We don't know if these people are straight up gangster, or if there's something supernatural, seriously supernatural, about them. That hat would probably work on 80% of people, but I don't know. We don't know anything about them.\nMARISHA: Well, they're not going to recognize any of us, are they?\nSAM: We could go do some recon.\nTRAVIS: Besides, have we seen all the brothels in Emon? I don't think so.\nSAM: We should do some research, some reconnaissance while someone goes for the money.\nLAURA: Or should we wait? I really want the money.\nTALIESIN: People get married in my family for money. I think it's perfectly reasonable.\nSAM: Listen, we could all go get the money and be back in four days, right?\nLAURA: No, because some people need to do some work. We need to send some people off.\nSAM: Split the party?\nLIAM: Yes.\nLAURA: Hopefully be back in time.\nTALIESIN: There's four days. We can each do our part. Five days.\nLIAM: Keyleth, can you-- Kiki.\nMARISHA: Yes? Sorry.\nLIAM: Can you and Scanlan fly to Kraghammer?\nMARISHA: Yes. I would like to stop and talk to Gilmore first, though, before I leave. Do I have time for that? I can fly.\nLAURA: Our illustrious god just told us it's better to stick to the road because there's bad things--\nMARISHA: In the air? There's air traffic? I have to worry about air traffic?","response":"DM: By horseback, you want to stick to the road. By air--"}
{"prompt":"SAM: By air, though. Check yourself, Kiki--\nMARISHA: What?\nSAM: You, I would assume, use Polymorph as I do.\nMARISHA: No, I use my Beast Shaping.\nSAM: Ooh. That's so sexy. Does that last for longer than a day?\nMARISHA: It lasts as long as I want it to last.\nSAM: Damn!\nTRAVIS: I go up to the kitchen and look for something to eat.\nMARISHA: It's in my blood.\nSAM: You can be an animal as long as you want?\nMARISHA: Where are you going with this, Scanlan?","response":"DM: You can stay in Beast Shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level. Five hours right now, you can transform for."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So when I mean as long as I want, I mean, long enough to where I've never had to really think about it before now.\nSAM: Well then, like me, flying there would not be an option. We'd have to stop, rest, walk, sleep.\nLAURA: Yeah, that would slow it down a lot.\nMARISHA: Well, I could get ten hours, because I can use two Beast Shaping abilities.\nLAURA: But that's still a two days' flight--\nLIAM: Two days is the horse, riding hard. What about an eagle?\nMARISHA: No, I get my druid shapes back after a short rest.\nLAURA: Oh, okay.\nMARISHA: Because Circle of the Moon, bitch.","response":"DM: So you could Beast Shape twice, rest 30 minutes, Beast Shape twice."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I make a stop first, and then I'll run an errand?\nLIAM: We don't really have a lot of money at the moment.\nLAURA: She might have some.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I've got my personal fundsies.\nTALIESIN: Can you leave me an earpiece so that I can keep in contact? I'm not leaving my workshop.\nMARISHA: I have an earpiece, right?\nLAURA: We'll leave you alone, Percy. To work.\nMARISHA: Is there anything else you need from us, Percy? Is there anything you need while I'm out and about?\nTALIESIN: Leave me an earpiece, and I'll call if I need anything else.\nTRAVIS: Percy, is there anything in this shop that you want in the Bag of Holding for later?\nTALIESIN: Not yet. Thank you, Grog.\nLAURA: Do you not have an earpiece?\nTRAVIS: I'll give him mine.\nTALIESIN: How many minutes has it been? I'm wondering if his hands are starting to itch yet.","response":"DM: About this time, you start to get this weird tingling sensation around your fingers."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do they crave blood?","response":"DM: No, they crave some sort of an agent that will prevent the now slight burning sensation."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Ow. Quick question. Sorry, I kept something from falling in the shop-- really quick reflexes-- it's making my bits tingle. Do you have anything for that?\nLIAM: You haven't been scratching yourself, have you?\nTRAVIS: No, I had that before. Not the same thing.\nTALIESIN: There's a bucket of water in the corner. You can try that.\nTRAVIS: I go over to the bucket of water and I stick my hands in the water.\nTALIESIN: It'll make it worse.","response":"DM: It does. The slight burning sensation now has turned into a very vibrant burning white hot on the skin, and you can see bits of the skin start to peel back a little bit, beginning on the edges."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I hand him a small bag of powder. Now you've learned not to touch things if you don't know what they are.\nTRAVIS: What do I do with a bag of powder?\nTALIESIN: I pour the powder on his hands.","response":"DM: It foams up a little bit in places, but it is neutralized."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: You're a good friend.\nTRAVIS: Can I leave now? I go to the kitchen to eat.\nMARISHA: I'm going to go make a trip to Gilmore's. Anybody want to join?\nLIAM: I should probably tag along.\nSAM: I'll come, too.\nORION: Yes, hi, if you do not remember me, I am Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. Moreover, Vox Machina, over at Greyskull Keep.","response":"DM: \"Where have I heard that--\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, we told you multiple times before. We met with you using your sigil of teleport-- it's fine. I've come here on a matter of business anyway, so that's neither here nor there. I was wondering if I may procure an address, or number as it were, for a sigil to Kraghammer. I believe the Thunderbrands would have some facility near theirs or on their own premises where their sigil could be channeled through the Circle of Teleportation spell.","response":"DM: \"If you're talking about sigils for teleportation, you would probably have to discuss that with Gatekeeper Xanthas.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Where is he? I thought that was you.","response":"DM: \"No. I'm the clerk. I run the front of the-- follow me.\" And he gets up and leads you further into the structure to the central circular room, the white-marbled room that contains all the doors around, and in the center there is the Traverse Junction. This is the place you guys have stumbled into every single time you've teleported back to Emon. And there you see the elven wizard who you recently bothered naught but maybe five hours ago, who is currently setting up some sheets, comes back. \"Oh. Hello, again.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hi. I'm Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. Moreover, Vox Machina over at Greyskull Keep. I was wondering-- and I asked your clerk here because I thought he did what you actually do here-- if I may procure, for coin or perhaps some kind of favor of sorts, the address or number or code or whatever it is that would work for the Kraghammer sigil of my Circle of Teleportation.","response":"DM: \"I get an understanding here that you're seeking access to one of our many sigil-based rooms of transference. Those rooms are currently under very protected lock and key, approval by the headmaster Thurmond Adalum himself.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, where is he?\nMARISHA: Oh my god. It's like calling Time Warner Cable.\nORION: Can you take me to him? Where is he at?","response":"DM: Glances over at the clerk, who goes, \"Right this way, Mr. Stormwind.\" He leads you back to a long, long hallway with arched ceiling. You can see the marble itself has these carvings and sculptures of various dead-looking faces of long-passed mages that either were built or held in high esteem in the halls of this lyceum. At the very end, it opens up into a pretty well-decorated, almost over-the-top decorated office room for the headmaster himself. The interior is lined with large, large 15, 20-foot-tall bookshelves around this oval room with sliding ladders that are attached to them that slowly glide on their own, like they're on some sort of arcane-based pattern that puts them back and forth. There is a large chandelier of brightly colored orbs that sits 35, 40 feet in the air, that slowly rotates on its own that keeps this slowly fluctuating changing color of the room. And in the center there is a circular desk, and sitting there at the desk you can see is Headmaster Thurmond, who is this extremely elderly human male. Shaved face, very short, curved bald head with a little bit of hair in the back, hunched forward and is currently collecting a series of books into his arms. Looks like he's about to get up. And he turns and looks over. \"Can I help you?\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hello.\nORION and SAM: I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.\nORION: Moreover, Vox Machina over at Greyskull Keep here in Emon. We are the saviors of this town and whatnot. Anyway, that's neither here nor there. I went through this fellow, who I thought was the job of this fellow, but it wasn't either of those jobs, it was you who I've been needing to talk to, I'm assuming?","response":"DM: \"What do you require from me, then?\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm hoping to procure an address or access to the sigils of Kraghammer through my Circle of Teleportation spell and whatnot using your arcane gates. That's about it.\nSAM: Well put!","response":"DM: \"If you're asking for access to one of our closely guarded sigils for the Thunderbrands, you say, within Kraghammer?\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, yes. We'll have to speak with them as well.","response":"DM: \"Well, then I will-- just one moment.\" And he reaches into a pouch and pulls out this mirror, this oval mirror and sets it onto his desk. Reaches underneath and pulls out a small chest. Opens up the chest, and you can see in this chest that there are probably two dozen of these tiny little marbles, all different colors, some different shapes, and he goes, these little labels you can't really see from your perspective. He takes one out, places it in the top of the mirror, and as he does, the mirror all of a sudden shimmers for a second, and what was originally a normal reflection is now this light, glowing blue, slightly glowing water-like surface. He takes it and lifts it up to himself. \"Hello. Hello? Hello!\" A moment later, you hear this distant voice echoing with this strange warbling filter over it. \"I'm coming, what's taking your time. Yes, Headmaster, what do you require?\" \"Well, there's a gentleman here, dragonborn, who is requesting use of your sigil of teleportation. Do you know this gentleman?\" Turns it around, and you can see in there, this is the same long-bearded dwarven individual that met you at the actual Thunderbrand house, and had a bit of an argument with you early in your travels in Kraghammer."}
{"prompt":"ORION: We've got things for you, this time, like we said we would get for you. In the Underdark. It's really inconvenient, but we have things that we need to get to you quickly.","response":"DM: \"Now, listen here. Last we spoke, you and your friends stormed into our lair, nearly destroyed our precious arcane defenses of our homestead--\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: He was drinking. He's an alcoholic. He's got help since then.","response":"DM: Make a deception check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What is it?","response":"DM: This is deception. Well, you are an alcoholic, but that wasn't what he meant."}
{"prompt":"ORION: 20.\nORION: (in same accent as Matt) Of course. Oh, sorry, I started to sound like you.\nTALIESIN: Bring me another accent, aye.\nORION: Of course. I wouldn't expect you to. I'm Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. My father Kruvanis Stormwind has helped the Council for over two generations. We come from a noble house, and I give you my word that I will never abuse-- abuse?-- however you pronounce it in your tongue. The privilege of quickly traveling to your stead to do business with you, and there would be no other intrusion otherwise. I guarantee it as my name as a Stormwind.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Chief negotiator!\nORION: That's 11.","response":"DM: 11. His head turns to the side a little bit, peering through you with a slight scowl. \"Last we talked, the reason we didn't report you to the guard for breaking through our defenses was you promised to look beneath the city and bring back various artifacts you were in search of.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ooh, we found one!","response":"DM: \"Did you, now?\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: A couple, yes. And we killed a bunch of those buttholes.","response":"DM: \"Can I see one of these artifacts?\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: I don't have it on me right now.","response":"DM: \"We're done here, Headmaster.\" And the mirror shimmers and closes suddenly."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait. No?\nLIAM: Good try!\nLAURA: We can bring-- oh, we're not there.","response":"DM: The headmaster takes the marble out and says, \"I'm sorry that didn't seem to go your way.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's fine, Headmaster. I'll be back in about 15 minutes with the proper proof that we did procure the things that the man, that needed to have proof, did. Excuse me! And I get the hell out of there. And as soon as I get out of there, I cast Fly on myself, and I Gandalf (whoosh) right back to the keep.\nLAURA: I don't know. I guess so.\nSAM: As we walk, do we see Tiberius fly over our heads?\nLAURA: Actually, I'm staying at the Keep.\nORION: Well, Travis is my target, right? Are you still at the Keep?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I'm eating.","response":"DM: As far as time goes, you haven't quite gotten to that point yet, for these guys. You get to Gilmore's. You enter the interior. You can see that for the most part, there aren't a lot of people in here. It's getting later in the day, and a lot of the customer business seems to be happening almost earlier, either pre-noon, or around noon. There's no current sign of Gilmore. You do see, across the way-- what's her name, again?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Sherri.","response":"DM: Thank you. Sherri, the mousy helper who runs the shop in Gilmore's absence, or at least runs the first portion of it, with her thick glasses up on her nose, and she's sitting there with her elbows over the top of the main desk. She looks up as you enter, and takes her glasses and pokes them for a second. \"Hello? Hi.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do you remember us?","response":"DM: \"Right, I do.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: From Vox Machina? We're sponsored by Gilmore. He put the brand on my armor that my mother gave me.","response":"DM: \"And you should be wearing it proudly, yes? Now, what can I help you with?\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, is Gilmore around?\nLIAM: Yes, I was hoping to catch up with him. We've been gone a while, and I was hoping to trade news with Glorious Gilmore. Is he not in at the moment?","response":"DM: \"Gilmore's in Westruun, currently setting up the expansion of the Gilmore's Glorious Goods business. If this is important, I can certainly summon him here.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'd hate to pull him away from business. I don't want to get in the way of his business. I mean, I am rather sad not to see him, but no, I don't think that would be a course of action we'd want to take. Let him continue to set up.\nLIAM: Can you get a message to him, though?","response":"DM: \"Yes, I can, actually.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, tell him Vax'ildan and friends visited. We're in the city for a week.","response":"DM: She pulls out a small sheet of what looks like a rough-around-the-edges piece of parchment, and starts the inkwell, scribbling down."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Vax'ildan. That's with an A, not an E. We're here for a week. I don't know if he's going to be back from Westruun before then, but if he is, tell him to get word to me. I'm very interested in exchanging news for the past few weeks.\nLIAM: Thank you. We're here late in the day; are you still open for business?","response":"DM: \"We are open, yes.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I was just curious if you guys had a chance to think about the alchemy workshop that we talked about before, or if you maybe had any alchemy books that came in that I was requesting?","response":"DM: \"It's possible. We haven't completely restocked the shelves, as of late. I know we had some new things come in. I can go check.\" And as she turns, all of a sudden there's a large, vibrant, white flash of light and a sound from the back room. The beaded curtains shift, for a second, and you hear heavy footsteps. And pushing through the beaded curtain, you see before you, with a bead of sweat on his head, Gilmore! \"I'm so glad you came back!\""}
{"prompt":"SAM and MARISHA: Gilmore!","response":"DM: \"I'm sorry. I was out and about, running some business a ways away.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You didn't have to go to all that trouble to come back here.","response":"DM: \"How could I miss seeing my fine-- there's not as many of you as usual.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, we're seeing to different bits of business. I turn back to him, I walk forward with hands out. I walk up to him, take him by the head, give him a good European-style kiss just about here-- right there-- come back, and say, there is so much to talk about. Where can we be alone?","response":"DM: He looks over at the rest of the group. \"Well, I mean--\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: See to whatever business you need to.\nSAM: We'll just peruse, yeah. We'll window shop.","response":"DM: He walks back through the beaded curtain, giving you this look over his shoulder. As he does, the curtain falls behind him."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Those beads.\nTRAVIS: Oh jeez!\nLIAM: I walk right in. Follow him in.","response":"DM: And you can see now, as the glow gently fades, there is a rug that is pushed to the side, and on the floor of his room there is a familiar sigil, similar to the one that you've seen Tiberius scrawl before in some of his spells. That's apparently how he got here so quickly. But he walks in, and he kicks the rug back over it, sits down on the edge of his bed, puts his hands up and goes, \"What seems to be troubling you?\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I walk over and I sit down opposite him, and I say: Before we talk about anything, I feel like I should apologize because although we didn't have any sort of written agreement, you and I are friends, aren't we?","response":"DM: \"Yes.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I was supposed to help bring your brand wherever we went. And I thought that would be possible. We came back from the Underdark. We had a very hard time, some of the hardest weeks of my life. I haven't delivered on my promise. And I mean to, but I haven't yet. I apologize wholeheartedly. I'm sorry.\nLIAM: In addition to that, I am changed, and promises mean more to me, even more than they did before. And I promise to follow through. In the interest of time for the game, DM, Vax tells the whole story of the Underdark, of the horn, of how close it was.\nMARISHA: Ugh, what is taking him so long, Scanlan?\nSAM: I don't know.","response":"DM: While that's happening, the rest of you are left there awkwardly staring about."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Did Sherri find my book? Sherri?","response":"DM: A few minutes go by. Sherri comes back. She brings two books over. \"Best I can tell, these may be what you're looking for? I can't quite--\" She sets them down. One is a book that is the properties of various liquids, chemicals, and things that are found on this plane and otherwise. It's a good way to locate and identify phantom liquids, should you come across any."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That would be good for Scanlan.\nTALIESIN: He is the source of a lot of phantom liquids.","response":"DM: The other book appears to have a section about alchemy. It's essentially almost a beginner's guide, but it's a very, very easy-to-follow introduction to a number of various low-level sorceries and the creation of low-level spell components preparing them for use with spell-casting, and there is a chapter on a little bit of alchemy."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, how much are these, Sherri?","response":"DM: \"They haven't been priced, yet.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good going, Keyleth! I like it!","response":"DM: \"25 gold, each.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 25 gold, each? Oh, come on. I know some university student dropped these off and donated these. Don't kid me, Sherri. Am I doing it right? Do I sound like Vex?","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Damn it!\nTALIESIN: I was about to say, make her do a persuasion roll, it'd be funny.\nSAM: Unforced error.\nTALIESIN: I'm sorry!\nLIAM: I spoke too soon!\nTRAVIS: So perfect! So perfect for you.","response":"DM: She reaches out and takes the books and slides them back, and says, \"Well, if that's how you feel, perhaps these can be returned to those university students that perhaps left them by. I should put these in the lost and found.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Sherri!\nSAM: Sherri. If I may. What Keyleth was trying to say was that she never got a chance to go to college, and that she wanted to get that university experience.","response":"DM: \"Good luck.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, that didn't work. Hey, can you serve me, now?\nMARISHA: (whispering) Scanlan. Scanlan! Will you buy those books for me, and I'll reimburse you?","response":"DM: \"I can hear you. I'm right here.\""}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Walk away!","response":"DM: \"Yes, I'm happy to help you.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: I was wondering if you had a small box of some sort that could carry a magical item, and perhaps shield it from detection.","response":"DM: \"That? Yes, we do have a couple of those. Hold on.\" She darts up the stairway in the other room and goes to the second floor. A few moments later, she comes back down with these two small chests-- they're about that big, each. One's a lighter wood color, the other is painted black all over. \"We have both of these. They should shield something of this size from most low-level magical detections. These will run you about 200 gold apiece.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: I just need one. You're a woman of the world, and I'm sure you have fine taste, judging by your appearance. It is quite fine, if I may say so myself. If I were a little taller, I would probably ask you out on a date.","response":"DM: \"If you were a little taller, yes.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Sherri is sassy today!\nORION: She's full of sass!\nSAM: Which one is the fancier of the two?","response":"DM: \"Well, looking at these, this one--\" She points to the one that looks like just a casual, wood chest. \"This would be easier to hide in plain sight amongst the rest of your furniture. This one, however, would be difficult to locate in a more shaded, or lightless, circumstance.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hm. I want ostentatiousness.","response":"DM: \"Then perhaps this one?\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes, please. That. Thanks. Thank you. 200 to you. Also, I know Gilmore is otherwise entertained. Can you try to identify something for me? Do you have that-- I mean, judging by the glint in your eye and beauty in your heart, I'm sure you have many skills I don't know about, but I'm wondering if you could identify this small, red vial with a floating something in it, that I procured quite some time ago! Do you remember that?","response":"DM: Yes. This vial, if I recall, it has this small--"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Have I tried this, once before?","response":"DM: No, this is the one that was found--"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Me and Pike found some stuff in somebody's house? I don't even remember, this was a year ago.","response":"DM: Right. Yes, okay. There we go. And make a persuasion roll, actually, on this one."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A lot.\nTALIESIN: Oh, look: a real roll.\nMARISHA: Shut up.\nSAM: Persuasion? It's 35. Wait, 31. 31.\nTRAVIS: Matt just visited his mind palace.","response":"DM: She looks at you, and goes, \"You have been good patrons, and you have been much kinder to me than others. We'll put this one on the house. We'll call this on the house.\" And as she takes the vial, sets it down, and she pulls out another book that she shuffles through, puts it up, turns through a few pages, until, looking through, \"This here would be a Potion of Fire Breath. When imbibed, it should give you a temporary time period of the ability to breathe fire, much like a relatively young dragon. This one in particular is fire. There are many different vials like this that pertain to different colorations of dragon, but this one is specifically for the red.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, thank you so much. Two more questions, then I'll leave you alone. One: where can I go get business cards printed up, in this town? It's a calling card? Never mind! Forget it.","response":"DM: \"Like a flyer?\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes!","response":"DM: \"Those can be printed. There is a-- actually, a pretty well-designed print facility not that far up the road.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, great! Thank you; I'll go investigate that. And one other thing: you know those books that my friend was asking about? Could we maybe make those happen for her? I know that you had quoted her a low, low price of 25. I'd be prepared to pay even more than that for them. And compose you a little song about yourself.","response":"DM: At which point, for the first time since the entire time you've been in the shop of Gilmore's Glorious Goods, you see a slight grin creep across her lips. She goes, \"How could a lady say no to a song? 25 gold! The price stands.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: So I have to pay you and sing to you?","response":"DM: \"We run a business, here, yes.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: I bring out my-- something.\nSAM: (sings) Sherri baby, Sherri baby, Sherri, won't you come home tonight? Come home tonight? You better ask your mama. Tell her you're without a gnome! Why don't you come home to my keep!","response":"DM: \"Pay for the books!\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, here you go!","response":"DM: You can see, her face is flushed and she, (clears throat)."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I Druidcraft a flower real quick and slip it to Scanlan to give to her.\nSAM: Oh! Here you are.","response":"DM: \"Thank you.\""}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (gasps) Did she blush?","response":"DM: She's red in the face. At this point in time, the beaded curtains reopen. Have you finished the conversation, or do you want to keep going?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No. After ten minutes of finishing all that, of telling every tiny detail, if you mind me backtracking, I briefly place my hand on top of his, and say, it was terrible. I've never seen anything like it. Now we're back. We're in our home, and I'm hoping to learn how Uriel is doing, how the city is faring. Is there any news? Things are ill in Kraghammer; they still haven't seen the last of their troubles, but I'm also concerned for our new home here.","response":"DM: \"As far as I'm aware, this city has been doing rather well. Since Winter's Crest just this previous year, trade has been booming, we're opening up pathways all across the continent, we've improved relations with many other distant kingdoms, and I'm opening a second shop! I mean, that's amazing! And who would've thought?\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And Westruun, how's it going?","response":"DM: \"So far, so good. We're going through the construction process, and I'm making sure that I have a rather supple income of artifacts and oddities that I have to sell at both locations. I have to widen my input of various items and--\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're a busy man.","response":"DM: \"Oh, yes.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Have you any time for leisure?","response":"DM: \"Eventually.\" You can see, he's a little more worn than you've seen Gilmore before. He's still Gilmore, and he's excited, but after the tale you told him and opening the second shop has been a little rough on him, and his jovial self is a little more wearied. Though he still looks fabulous."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You seem a tad weary. Is there anything I can do to help you?","response":"DM: \"Just praise the brand. Praise the brand, young Vax.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That will happen. I did not even mean to discuss this, coming here, but I noticed, coming in, a sigil under your carpet. I had no intention of this, but we need to get back to Kraghammer in a bit of a hurry, and I certainly have no abilities, but do you remember my friend Tiberius? Dragonborn fellow?","response":"DM: \"Yes! Yes, I remember him.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He needs to run an errand back in Kraghammer. Is there any way you could hook us up with a favor?","response":"DM: \"What kind of favor?\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I just want to send the lizard to Dwarf Town. Do you think we could make that happen?\nMARISHA: \"Send the lizard to Dwarf Town?\" How many more slurs can you have in one sentence?","response":"DM: \"My sigil here is for returning personal use. Did you hear that? There was some strange noise in the sky. This is for my return. As far as outgoing, most other sigils are-- well, they're up here. Looking for that, you're going to have to go to the Lyceum, I'm afraid.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Understood. I don't want to push my luck.","response":"DM: \"However, if you're going to the Lyceum... I am owed a favor or two. Let me see what I can do, here.\" And he goes, and he pulls out another piece of similar paper and he writes a quick little note on the side, sends it up in the air, and it vanishes. He goes, \"I've just done you a favor. Keep that in mind. You go to the Lyceum, you should have access to one of these sigils. Make sure you choose properly. You only have one.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm pretty magic-stupid.","response":"DM: \"Then don't be the one that does it. Talk to your friend, this Tiberius fellow. He'll know what to do, I'm sure.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Correct. One last. It's small or it's boring, it's business. I need a dagger. I don't want one for free or anything; I want to purchase it, but we're a little low on funds. The reason Tiberius needs to go to Kraghammer is because we're owed a large sum of money.","response":"DM: \"Right, you mentioned this last time, when you almost opened a line of Gilmore's Glorious Credit.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Mm-hm. I'm not there.\nLIAM: What would the credit entail?","response":"DM: \"Previously, we discussed 25,000 gold pieces, the amount of which you were going to retrieve.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I was going to-- what was that?","response":"DM: \"Retrieve.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Retrieve? God, I've been in the Underdark so long. What was the deal?","response":"DM: \"The deal was since you did not have funds, and you had to retrieve this money from this 'Dwarf Town', as you so graciously put it, that you would borrow the money, at the time, and then pay me back within a month. Within a month.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Understood.\nMARISHA: Wait, is Gilmore trying to say we owe him money?\nLIAM: No. We almost did that. Correct, DM? That's what we almost did, but we didn't do it. You offered it.","response":"DM: Correct. You backed out last minute when you realized there was, apparently, hidden platinum--"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I would be interested-- Gilmore? I really just need a quick favor, and I mean to pay you back quickly. I need a dagger for something. Not your best dagger. Not your shittiest dagger, either. I just need something nice. How much would a fine dagger cost? Something that would be good in a fight. And could I pay you back in a couple of days, once Tiberius returns from Kraghammer?","response":"DM: \"If you want something functional, there are masterwork daggers out there. We do have base-level enchantments that give you a fine, honed edge and a balance that cannot be beaten for its price range. For that, I can easily give you one of our base-level enchanted items for no more than, friend discount included, 400 gold pieces.\""}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's a pretty good deal.\nLIAM: Can I please purchase three of those?","response":"DM: \"You may!\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Done.\nLIAM: I reach out and I give his cheek a little bubby-squeeze, and I clap him on the cheek, and say, I'm good on my word, and you're a good friend. Thank you, Gilmore.","response":"DM: \"The least I could do. Pay me back. I'll find you.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I know you're good on your word.","response":"DM: \"Indeed.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Keyleth? Scanlan?\nSAM: Oh, yes! How'd it go in there? You're walking straight, so it couldn't have gone too well.\nLIAM: Very good. Warm in here.\nTALIESIN: That dagger's so sharp, it could cut the sexual tension.\nORION: Those are masterwork daggers?","response":"DM: They are plus-one enchanted daggers, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, let's get out of here and go. Did you find us any--?\nLIAM: I'm good. No, everything's good here. Just not everywhere else.\nSAM: Let's get out of here, go back to the keep.","response":"DM: At this point, now, Tiberius, you have coasted over the air, and as you come careening in, you hear (swishing sounds) and look down. Two crossbow bolts whiz past you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's me, you idiots!","response":"DM: At which you hear immediately, \"Oh, sorry!\" \"Sorry! We're not used to having you bolt in from the skyline.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm in a hurry, sorry! (whoosh)","response":"DM: As you sweep past Shayne and Cordell, they both change their bolts, and they're both arguing with each other, like, \"You should've seen it was him!\" \"Sorry.\" \"Sorry, again!\" You make your way into the courtyard, inside Greyskull Keep."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Why'd you miss?\nORION: I go into, I rush in to find him eating. (stammers) Quickly, quickly! And I go into the Bag of Holding and I take the item out that we need. What was it?\nTRAVIS: Well, we have a bunch of stuff.","response":"DM: You're not with him, there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I walk into the room to see Tiberius throwing things out of the Bag of Holding, I'm assuming.\nORION: I can't, because I have to visualize what it is to pull it out.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, what are you looking for?\nLIAM: I'm using my earring on the walk home. Does it work? I don't know what the range is. Tiberius, can you hear me? Tibs?","response":"DM: You're pretty out of range at this point."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What are you looking for, Tiberius?\nORION: I've taken my hand out. When we were in the Underdark and one of the items that we procured while we were scavenging, and we looted it, and we could give it back to the Thunderbrand.\nTRAVIS: Oh! Pieces of the enemy? We get paid for it.\nLAURA: But there were artifacts that they wanted. I remember.\nMARISHA: They wanted a necklace, right?\nORION: Yes. And we found one or two of them.\nMARISHA: Found a necklace, who was supposed to go-- hang on, I'm finding it, I'm looking.\nTRAVIS: I've got two gold necklaces, two gold chalices, and two rubies.","response":"DM: It was actually a magical item, one that you may have equipped. It'll say in the description of the item that it has an inscription on the back."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I don't have it.\nTRAVIS: I don't have that shit.\nSAM: Whoa, what? It was a necklace we're talking about?","response":"DM: Protection of some kind, if I recall. Amulet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I don't have that. (gasps) Oh no! What if we gave it to Kima?\nORION: We didn't give it to them.\nLAURA: But Kima took some armor we found!\nSAM: \"Amulet of Natural Armor?\"","response":"DM: Look in the description of the item. It should say underneath the name. It'll have the actual inscription written in the descriptor of the item."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Everybody look at your stuff. I look inside my Belt of Dwarvenkind, and it says \"Badass.\"\nMARISHA: It's a sapphire pendant that should say, \"To Lorna, my love.\"\nLAURA: (gasps) Oh!\nORION: That's what I reach in and grab. There you go! Keyleth. I mean, your highness. I like your hair.\nMARISHA: Thank you!\nORION: It looks cool.\nMARISHA: Thanks!","response":"DM: It is enchanted."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's not the one you're wearing, right, Scanlan?\nLAURA: No, I remember we found it and nobody equipped it.\nTRAVIS: I had it in the bag, yeah.\nORION: I take it out, and I put it in mine. Grog, I'm finding out a way, as soon as I can show this to you, fellow. I'm going to go into Kraghammer very, very fast as opposed to slowly, and it is, so we should leave right now.\nLAURA: Can I go with you?\nORION: Yeah, and I'll cast-- because, who was around, just them two?","response":"DM: Just those two."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I cast Fly again at 3rd or 4th level, to cast on them.\nTRAVIS: I don't want to go!","response":"DM: Now, all of a sudden, you're (whoosh) lifted up in the air."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, but we get there much faster if we fly. And I go.\nLAURA: And I take off after him!\nTRAVIS: What if I want to stay?\nORION: You can stay.\nTRAVIS: But I'm fucking floating above my meal! No! This is bullshit. And I'm bouncing off the ceiling and shit. Can I control myself?","response":"DM: You can. It takes a moment to adjust to it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I just start trying to swim down to my plate.","response":"DM: It takes you a little bit, but you do eventually get control of it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (eating noises) This isn't so bad. (farting noise)","response":"DM: Propulsion does work."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: As we're flying, can I keep an eye out for our party members that are returning?","response":"DM: Yep. And as you guys coast over, you see, leaving the exterior wall gate to the south side of Emon, you see the rest of your party walking back towards the keep."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That means we're close enough. Brother!\nLIAM: Hello?\nLAURA: We're heading to the portal, Tiberius is working on something. We can get there faster! I'll be back soon.\nLAURA: Brilliant!\nORION: Ooh, that gives me a wonderful idea! And then, I'll cast it at 4th level again, and I'll go (pew-pew!) and cast it on--\nMARISHA: Just because I think it's funny-- Grog is flying over too, right?\nTRAVIS: I'm in that kitchen, floating around, farting and eating food. Look, I've got priorities.\nMARISHA: Okay, well, I see you guys are flying? The two of you?","response":"DM: So you fly down and cast Fly on the rest of them?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Right. Come on, follow me!\nLIAM: Holy shit, I've never flown before! This is amazing!\nSAM: I'm flying, too? What's happening?","response":"DM: You guys are now floating. You guys are floating, as well. You're coasting over Emon for roughly 12 or so seconds before Grog, you drop to the ground, and now Tiberius and Vex, you begin to plummet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Why are we plummeting?","response":"DM: Fly is a concentration spell. You cast it again. Your amulet keeps it up for two rounds, which is 12 seconds, and then the previous Fly spell deteriorates."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What about my circlet?","response":"DM: That's what I'm saying. The circlet lets you maintain concentration for two additional rounds."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, okay! Tiberius, I'm falling!\nORION: I cast Fly again at 6th-level on everybody else.\nSAM: I start falling.\nORION: No, because I can catch everybody.","response":"DM: At that point, now all of you guys are flying."}
{"prompt":"ORION: You fall in the kitchen, though.\nTRAVIS: Well, that makes sense.\nLIAM: Is this going to stick, Tiberius?\nORION: Yes. It's the same spell. I just really need a nap after this. I really need a nap after this. I go back to gather them all.","response":"DM: You make your way. Now, all of you following Tiberius, you coast down to the Alabaster Lyceum, landing right through the front area (whoosh), this whole party appears. Catch your feet, and there you see the same clerk looking up. \"Ah, I see you've returned.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes. Can we not talk to the middle guy first? Can we go right to the last guy?","response":"DM: \"Down that hallway. Follow it to the very end.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Thank you very much.","response":"DM: \"You're welcome.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Follow me, everybody!","response":"DM: You all glide through the hallway, or walk, if you prefer. The end of the hallway, you open once again into the office, and there you see behind his desk once again, the headmaster Thurmond, who looks around. \"Oh, yes. You've returned. I received the note from your friend Gilmore, and you're welcome to utilize one of our sigils.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wonderful. That makes me quite happy.","response":"DM: \"To Kraghammer, was it?\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes, but I do not want to use that favor for that sigil. I would like to call our friends, and I brought the item. I bring out the amulet. I want to show our friends in Kraghammer that we actually brought them the thing to get their permission to go on their sigil, and the other continent that we were on is called what?\nLAURA: Vasselheim?\nORION: Yes. The favor I would like for Gilmore is to get the Vasselheim sigil, please. But let's contact our friends at Kraghammer first.","response":"DM: \"Two notes. There is no sigil in Vasselheim. They have been outlawed and destroyed to prevent arcane intrusion or subterfuge. There have been, historically, many a war's passed in which Vasselheim nearly fell to the sudden appearance of small armies within its walls, and as such, many of these sigils, all of them have been destroyed over the past 1,000 years. However, it was the third war--\" And he's going into a long diatribe about the history of Vasselheim."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You are so educated. Perhaps we could talk later about all of this wonderful history.\nORION: Using my Mage Hand, I'm like, it's one of the things that you wanted us to get.\nLAURA: Who are you talking to?\nORION: I can see it. It's fine.","response":"DM: \"What's it say? I can't read it from here. Read it out for me.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: What does it say, Keyleth?\nMARISHA: To Lorna, with love. It's written right there, Tiberius.\nORION: Oh, sorry. To Lorna, with love.\nLAURA: Oh, all of us?","response":"DM: No, the headmaster takes the mirror and puts it down. He points back to the clerk who's in the hallway behind you again, waiting, and says, \"Go ahead and bring them to the Junction. Allow them access to the sigil for House Thunderbrand in Kraghammer.\" He nods. \"Of course.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: As he's doing this, I'm writing the sigil that I'm seeing forming in my--","response":"DM: He leads you to the Junction, and there is one of the doors he opens up on the inside, there is the actual sigil to Kraghammer there. He gives you some time to study it, you memorize it, you get it locked in, and you now permanently know the sigil of teleportation to Kraghammer within the House Thunderbrand."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Shall we go collect our money now?\nSAM and LAURA: Yes.\nLIAM: We're all going? All of us?\nMARISHA: Well, I guess just the five of us, cause Grog and Percy are back at the Keep.\nSAM: Would you rather just send Tiberius, then?\nLAURA: No, we should go.\nMARISHA: I can go back and check in on them.\nORION: Everybody's here but Grog.\nTALIESIN: And me.\nORION: Wait, where are you? Oh, you're working. Tinkering.\nLIAM: I have an errand to run.\nLAURA: It's the three of us, me and you and--\nORION: Okay. Thunderbrands are buttholes, though.\nMARISHA: Wait. We'll address that later. Come on, Vax.\nLAURA: Persuasion-wise.","response":"DM: So you guys head back to the Keep, you meet up with Grog and Percy, what about you guys? What're you doing? For, Tiberius, Scanlan, and Vex."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We go through.","response":"DM: Well, it's just the sigil. You have to cast the spell."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and SAM: Oh.\nORION: Yeah. Is that what you want to do? Is that what's going on?\nSAM: It's a spell?\nORION: Oh, shit. No, actually, I need to sleep. All that flying left me a bit exhausted.\nLAURA: Oh my god.\nLIAM: Sorcerers, they improvise.\nLAURA: Wait, you're saying that we cannot go through?\nORION: Well, hold on. Maybe there's a way I could trigger the spell?\nSAM: Let's go home and go to sleep.\nORION: Let's get a drink, maybe? It's only been a day.\nMARISHA: You can cast that sigil anywhere, right? You don't have to be here? We could do it from home.\nLAURA: Then let's just fucking go home.\nORION: What time of the day is this? It's still afternoonish, right?","response":"DM: At this point in time, with all the travel back and forth, it's getting close to dusk."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Great.\nMARISHA: We'll take a nap and we'll go tomorrow. It's getting late, the Thunderbrands are probably going to bed at this point. We don't want to invade. They're probably just sitting down for dinner.\nSAM: They live in the Underdark. There's no real time there.\nORION: My swallow's been crafted at the other place, right? Has that happened already?","response":"DM: Yeah, it's been crafted for you, yeah. It's not a swallow. It's a quarterstaff with knives attached."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm calling it swallow. On the way back, because we're obviously going to leave in the morning, to do stuff. I'd like to quickly stop at any blacksmith I see on the way back to Greyskull Keep.","response":"DM: Okay. Yeah, there are a couple blacksmiths that you know about on the way through."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay. I go to the good one, not the bad one, per reputation.","response":"DM: Best reputation is Karin, but she's a specialist. She's the one that made Trinket's--"}

{"prompt":"ORION: Oh. Sorry, right. We've done business before. I would like to commission you. And as I'm doing this I'm taking out five of my daggers that I have, and I'm going to hand them to her. I would like to commission you to somehow craft these daggers into a type of bended glaive, if you would. I don't know how long it would take you to do so.","response":"DM: \"What?\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: You see, it's like, it would look like this, but it's--\nSAM: Krull?\nORION: Yeah, totally, but the blades are bended, but they're all connected in the center. You could use an iron, or a steel ingot to connect the--","response":"DM: \"I can certainly try, yeah, aye.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wonderful!\nORION: 100 gold pieces?","response":"DM: \"Aye, I'm a specialist!\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: You went to the good one.\nORION: What, that's all? I mean, oh yes, of course. Here's 120.\nORION: I trust your work. Trinket's armor was fantastic.","response":"DM: \"Huh?\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Did she do that? I thought that was the same character.\nLAURA: This is Karin.\nSAM: She just thought bear. She just knows bear.\nORION: Bear's armor. The bear's armor was--","response":"DM: \"Oh! You're friends with that one? She was real nice. That bear was adorable. Happy to help with that one.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: His name is Trinket.","response":"DM: \"Oh, is that what it was?\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm surprised she didn't tell you. It's an adorable name.","response":"DM: \"Probably had. It's just been a while.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: This is Lockheed.","response":"DM: \"Oh, you're so cute, Lockheed.\" You guys talk for a little bit and eventually make your way back."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I do business with her, and I go back to the keep.\nSAM: Are we still waiting for him outside?","response":"DM: Yeah, you guys are right outside."}
{"prompt":"SAM: When he comes out, I cast Minor Illusion to make it look like I have a long gray beard.\nSAM: Can we go home now, please, Tiberius?\nORION: Yes. Sorry.\nSAM: Any other stops you'd like to make? The dry-cleaners, perhaps?\nORION: Prestidigitation.\nSAM: Oh, that's great. Now let's go night-night so you can cast a spell on us.\nLIAM: While they're doing that, I stealth away from the group.\nMARISHA: Can I do a passive perception check to see if I notice him sneaking away?\nORION: I would like to fart. Natural 20!\nSAM: It's a huge fart.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll perception."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I rolled a 32.\nMARISHA: Perception or passive perception?","response":"DM: For this, because it's not active? It would be your passive."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Then that is 24.","response":"DM: Vax has vanished. While you might have noticed, instead the explosion-like eruption of gas from your dragonborn friend distracted you and gave him the proper getaway. You vanish."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I'm totally down an alleyway, through the alley, onto another main thoroughfare. I grab a random person on the street. Excuse me, I'm looking for a specific butcher. Harold the butcher. Do you know? I think he's in the upper slums. Can you point me toward him?","response":"DM: The individual you stopped is a younger gentleman, probably in his mid-20s or so, a bit dirty in the face and coming from a day of work, going to the local tavern to finish his eve with some drinks. \"I can't say I do.

{"prompt":"LIAM: I don't even say anything else. I just walk. I don't know how long that will take me.\nTRAVIS: I'm asleep on the table.","response":"DM: Yeah. Passed out. Percy's nowhere to be seen. You, I would like for you to make a tinkering roll in relation to the construction of ammunition."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ten.","response":"DM: Ten? You manage to, utilizing material for 20 bullets, only craft ten. But you get ten bullets out of it, as opposed to wasting the materials."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is it possible to, before I go to sleep, I have a basic poison potion I've been hoarding. Could I try to dip the tip of one of my bolts in that?","response":"DM: You can certainly try. There's a difference between poison and disease. They're different. The potion seems to have no effect."}
{"prompt":"ORION: On bolts?","response":"DM: It doesn't have any effect."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How many batches of bullets are you going to let me attempt to make?","response":"DM: For the day, that's what you spent making. Tomorrow, we'll get to whatever it is you want to craft then. You go off and manage to make your way to the upper slums."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes. I see a stunted old woman and stop her on the street and say, Grandmother. I'm looking for Harold the butcher. Do you know where I can find him?","response":"DM: \"Best I can gather, he'd be around that way.\" She points you, and the breath is awful. She's missing teeth, but her crooked finger curves off to the side, and you can see across the way, next to a homestead or hovel, there is a very humble-looking butcher that is currently in the process of closing shop."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'd like to go stealth. I rolled a 20.\nLIAM: Do I see Kynan anywhere? No? And it's a home? It's a business and a home?","response":"DM: It's hard to tell. It looks like a business from this perspective."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, I'd like to go around the back of the building and scope it out.","response":"DM: You look through the windows. There's a dull light on the inside from what looks like a small hooded lantern set up for a bit of interior light, but there's nobody else in the house."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: There's nobody in? I'd like to, at the window, listen and use perception to see if I can tell if anyone's inside.","response":"DM: You listen for a while. Make a perception roll."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, that's 25.\nLIAM: Is it one floor, the building?","response":"DM: It's one floor."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's one floor. Is the window locked?","response":"DM: You checked the window. It's not locked."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's a family residence where Kynan lives. Are there bedrooms?","response":"DM: It's hard to tell, looking around the room here. There are three doors that exit. One that he came through, which is apparently from the front of the butcher shop. This appears to be a central room that connects to wherever else he walked. There are two other doors."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: They're not trapped, are they?","response":"DM: They're not trapped."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I'm going to crouch down and push open the first door. What do I see?","response":"DM: The door immediately right or the door in front of you? The door in front of you is the one that the man traveled through."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, no. Not that one. There were two other doors, weren't there?","response":"DM: There's the door that he came in from when he sat down, and then he left through the door across the way from you, and there is a door that been unopened."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: There's one other door? That's the one.","response":"DM: Okay. You push open the door very quietly. It makes a little creaking sound, but you stop. Peering inside, it's dark. There appears to be a bed. There's a small table. There's what looks like an old pair of boots that are worn out on the side. It looks like a bedroom that nobody's currently in."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And there's no sign that this is a youth's bedroom or father's bedroom? What can I glean from what I see in here?","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to use Luck. That's better. 22.","response":"DM: Okay. You take a little bit of time in peering over the materials, looking at the bed size, looking at the boot size, looking at whatever you can nearby. This bed is definitely weathered. It's been used for a long time. There are a couple of small knick-knacks and toys that are discarded underneath that have been there for a while that lead you to believe that this was at one point a boy's room. However, what you do notice is that most of the materials, most of the belongings, anything that you would normally see in a boy's room, anything that would say that a person lives here seem to have been hastily grabbed and taken off."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hello. I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you. I know you've closed up shop.","response":"DM: \"I'm done for business for the day. Come back tomorrow.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm actually not looking to buy anything. I owe your son a bit of money. I lost some money in a wager we made on a dog fight, and I was hoping to reimburse him. Do you know where he is?","response":"DM: The door opens a little bit, and an eye peeks through. You gather there's a slight scent of alcohol from the other side as he starts talking. He says, \"I don't know where my son's gone off to. He came in in a huff. We got in an argument. He grabbed his stuff and left. He does this every now and then. He'll be back.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You think he'll be back?","response":"DM: \"This isn't the first time he's done this.\""}

{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: \"I can give that to him.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I take 50 gold of what I have left and I leave it with him, and I take out three daggers. I can hear my sister's voice in the back of my head. I want to use insight on him to make sure he's trustworthy. Oh, that's good. That's 20.","response":"DM: Okay. There's something about his face that gives you the feeling that he's more interested in the contents of what you're leaving than actually transferring these to the intended recipient."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just give him the 50 gold. Thank you. And I leave.","response":"DM: Okay. Closes the door behind you, you hear a lock. Light goes back out in the room."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Go in there and kill him. Kill him, shit on his bed, and leave.\nLIAM: I head back to the keep.\nMARISHA: I just flipped through my book on the alchemy section for a bit.\nLIAM: Another nine hours.","response":"DM: No. See you guys in about five minutes, quick restroom break. We'll be right back."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Adorable.","response":"DM: 35% does count. As you wake up, you reach up and feel the return of a nice hefty bit of scruff to your chin. Yeah, it's getting pretty thick now. It's a good, like, half an inch to an inch length. And you're starting to get a little, you notice the first time you grew some facial hair it was coming through that weird, creepy translucent color? It's starting to come through with a proper, almost a dark red-brown color to it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What?\nMARISHA: Got a little bit of the Irish thing going on.\nTRAVIS: I don't know, I might have to get a cage; the women are going to come running.","response":"DM: So as you all gather for breakfast, you get your fill, a fine breakfast awaits you, already prepared by your servants of the Greyskull Keep. What do you wish to do?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Good morning, Vox Machina. Lovely to see all of you.\nMARISHA: So Grog, you fell asleep in your plate of food and woke up with a beard.\nTRAVIS: I know. Some guys are just lucky.\nTALIESIN: Have we checked to make sure it's not a stain?\nLAURA: Good job, Percy, now he's never going to bathe.\nTALIESIN: You may have taken the wrong lesson away from that.\nTRAVIS: No, I pretty much got it. In, burn, ouch, powder.\nORION: You're not a chinchilla, Grog, which is a small creature that bathes itself in dust. But you are a human, which water is good.\nTRAVIS: I'm not a human.\nORION: Well, you are a humanoid. Which is, water is good. Which, most of you is water.\nTRAVIS: (gasps) You always drink water when we drink. Does it burn?\nORION: No, it feels rather--\nSAM: Let's get going.\nTALIESIN: He does breathe fire.\nORION: I'm feeding Lockheed some of my breakfast.","response":"DM: Certainly. Lockheed enjoys the breakfast. Lockheed is looking healthier. The color is a little more of a deep emerald green, and he appears to have a little more energy this morning."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Does it shit on your shoulder?","response":"DM: He hasn't noticed, but there is a slight streak of dried pseudo-dragon poo. You're not aware of it to cast that yet."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Methinks the DM doth speak from experience.","response":"DM: As a bird owner, he does."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to, I rolled, I'm going to do a roll for the day, I think I rolled one for the day, and I'm going to go: Staht. Staht. And I'm going to, I rolled a 14 to try to teach it to sit. Staht.","response":"DM: (lizard noises) It sits down on the edge of the table."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I give it a treat. Krar, Krar, there you go.","response":"DM: Bites your finger."}
{"prompt":"ORION: As it's hanging, I put it on my shoulder.","response":"DM: (lizard noises) It sits there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: They get nippy. It's in the breed.","response":"DM: So! What do you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We want to get out of here. Cast the thing. Let's go.\nORION: As I'm having my oatmeal and such, I start to cast.\nMARISHA: I still think maybe the more talkative members of the group should go?\nSAM: Still want to split the party?\nTALIESIN: I'm staying home, anyway\nMARISHA: I'm checking in with Tiberius-- oh sorry, Percy.","response":"DM: At which point the teleportation sigil appears in the center of the floor the way Tiberius had prepared it. It's glowing right now."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I've got the creature bits so I should go, too.\nLAURA: You! Take care of my bear, I'm leaving him here with you.\nLAURA: Oh, Trinket! I love you so.","response":"DM: Trinket comes up and like rubs his nose against your coat."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to feed you so much chocolate.\nLAURA: That's really bad for him! Don't!\nMARISHA: It'll be fine.","response":"DM: The sigil's starting to spark--"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I jump in.\nTRAVIS: I jump in, too.\nORION: Light! (whoosh)","response":"DM: As the light fills the room, you look around."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I cast it on Lockheed. On his tail.\nORION: Oh, Bensvelk! That means \"good\" in Draconian. Bensvelk. And I feed him a treat.\nLAURA: Wait. Do they know we're coming? We're just in the middle of their home now?\nORION: Yes, of course, Vex, they know we're coming. I showed them the amulet, it was how we got the sigil to come here to begin with. It's fine. We're doing business with them. It'll be good.\nLAURA: Can I perception and make sure there's no traps around us? Just to make sure. We're just popping in, and this is a magic house, am I right? So I can't check for traps worth shit.","response":"DM: Room looks safe!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Great. Good. Great.\nTRAVIS: Well, good. Let's get out of here.\nORION: I'm sorry. We thought you would like a night's sleep before we intrude and--","response":"DM: \"It's fine, step up the stairs, please.\" and he steps out of the way, leads you into the central chamber. This house is unfamiliar to all but Scanlan, who turned invisible suddenly and decided to wander in briefly."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes, I did. My old stomping grounds.\nORION: I'll open the Bag of Holding. And I'll take it out. Before I actually go over and speak, I'm going to turn to Scanlan and Vex. Is he the same person who pays us for the other--\nLAURA: No. I should probably go find that guy. Or we can go all together.\nORION: I just didn't want to say the wrong thing this time.\nSAM: Sure, don't worry. You will.\nORION: Oh, sorry. Here is the amulet. And I show him. Now, as far as trade, as it was rather taxing to procure this particular artifact--\nLAURA: Incredibly difficult, he means to say.\nORION: Yes, she's correct. I was wondering if we could, perchance, trade it for a favor of your arcane ability?","response":"DM: \"It's funny, because I already did. I gave you a permanent entry to my own household, my family's household, by offering you this sigil, that gave you entrance to the interior of our well-guarded estate. That was a trade enough. That was what we agreed upon through the mirror.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: That was just to get me here quicker, I thought.","response":"DM: \"So you come into my home and try to extort me?\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, not at all! Here's what happened, see. We were on an adventure-- I pull out the carpet out of my Bag of Holding. And this carpet was enchanted once with the ability to fly, and it helped us many times in many adventures. It was de-chanted, I guess, if you want to say it. And we need it re-chanted. And I thought that House Thunderbrand would be a strong enough house to have the ability to do such a thing. Maybe not as it seems. And I hand him the amulet as I'm saying this.","response":"DM: He takes the amulet."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And not as a trade, but as a favor for just the effort, or maybe because I'm not strong enough as a sorcerer myself to do it.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: People speak very, very highly of your abilities. Can I assist him?","response":"DM: It's not going to matter. You keep talking, and as you're explaining this, he's not even paying attention to you. The dwarf is staring at the amulet, looking at the back of it where the inscription is. And you swear for a minute, you see what looks like a tear, gathering in the corner of the eye of the dwarf, who then reaches up and wipes it from the corner and takes the amulet and puts it in the pocket and says, \"My apologies. Thank you for returning this. You were talking about the carpet, right?\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA and ORION: Yes.","response":"DM: \"You want it to be enchanted?\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, we've heard very wonderful things about your abilities and not many people can do such a feat.","response":"DM: \"We have done a carpet before. Only one. It's very possible.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Did it look anything like this one?","response":"DM: \"Not this pattern, no, that one was more of a blue. I mean this can be enchanted, but the materials and the time put into it-- It's a very pricey endeavor. A carpet of this size, especially.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: How much?","response":"DM: \"We're looking at the better part of a year to enchant this and that'll cost you about, time included, that'll cost 50,000 gold pieces.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my god! I throw my hands up. I just can't. I just can't! How did we not? Oh my god.\nSAM: She's very fond of the carpet.\nTRAVIS: I put my arm around Vex and try and console her.\nLAURA: 50? A year! Why?! Thank you so much.","response":"DM: \"Well I mean, there might be smaller ones you might be able to find elsewhere.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, I know it's a really beautiful carpet, and it would cost a lot of money to fix up, I understand.\nSAM: She loves the hand-woven carpets. It's just very tragic.\nTRAVIS: Shall we go get our money now?\nSAM: Yes, who's the man we need to see about that?\nLAURA: Oh, that's the Kraghammer-- We go to see--\nLIAM: Johnny Kraghammer?\nLAURA: Johnny Kraghammer.\nSAM: Nostoc Greyspine?\nLAURA: It was Greyspine.","response":"DM: Nostoc Greyspine. You're escorted out of the House Thunderbrand. Make your way down to the quarry, at the very bottom level of Kraghammer, once again. It's been a long time since you've been in this portion of the world, let alone this city, where you started this leg of your entire journey. You do make your way down into this area to Lord Nostoc Greyspine's proper office, the one where you managed to procure his expensive wine and make this venture the very beginning. You step into the familiar halls. As soon as you enter, you have a brief discussion with the guy at the front, who recognizes you and leads you into the office. There, waiting, behind his desk is Nostoc, who's currently in the process of looking out the window over the entire quarry of his mine. He turns over his shoulder, looking at the rest of you. \"Well, I'm surprised to see you all alive. Just assumed you'd all got yourselves killed, like the usual bumpkins who come wandering this far down in the mountain.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No. We did not die. We, in fact, succeeded in taking care of those creatures. Under-- dark-- carpet.\nSAM: She's-- That time of the month.\nLAURA: Oh! Excuse me. We came to collect the money you owed us for completing the mission you sent us on.","response":"DM: \"Ah yes, of course. Of course. Understood. What was the price we had agreed for that one?\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, it was 30,000 gold, plus all the extras for the scalps that we acquired.\nTRAVIS: I open the bag of holding and go, Here, here's one brain chunk. And I dump it on the floor.","response":"DM: As a note, I'm pretty sure at practically no point in your adventure to the Underdark did you ever say you were scalping a creature."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're above base--\nMARISHA: We totally forgot about that.","response":"DM: You completely, in the entirety of that adventure, didn't collect a single scalp from anything you killed."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I thought I grabbed the brain chunk. I thought I grabbed an arm, too. There was just an arm from the stitched guy, and I just grabbed it.\nLIAM: An arm is not a scalp. It's this.","response":"DM: Nostoc also looks at you and goes, \"And while I respect your memory, a dwarf's mind is like a trap that you can't escape. I believe the agreed upon price was 25,000 gold pieces.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh it was? That is so weird, I remember 30.","response":"DM: \"I don't even know what you fought. If you're going to collect your money, tell me what the hell you freaking killed.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Mind flayers! A beholder! Have you heard of a beholder?","response":"DM: \"You fought a beholder?\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We fought a fucking beholder.","response":"DM: \"Really? And you're all still alive?\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well no, not all of us. If you'll recall there were more of us when we came down here. And some of us aren't here because they died.\nTRAVIS: I start pretending to cry.","response":"DM: Make a deception check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's really good.\nSAM: 21.\nLAURA: I start thinking about the carpet and I really do start crying.\nSAM: So before you berate us, know that we are mourning the loss of two of our members. And a bear!\nLAURA: (sobbing) And my bear!","response":"DM: \"Beholder, you say?\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It was really big.","response":"DM: \"What else did you encounter?\""}

{"prompt":"LAURA: We destroyed half of an elder brain-- Part of an elder brain.\nTRAVIS: And there were all these dark, um, dark-\nLAURA: Dwarves! There were dark dwarves. Duergar.\nSAM: They were mind controlled. It was crazy, we're not just making this up. It really happened.\nORION: This is all very, very true.\nTRAVIS: There were these wrinkled testicles that were walking around on feet.\nLAURA: He almost died! Just from this one little brain.\nTRAVIS: Strange thing. If you're stupid, and it looks at you with its wrinkled testicle face? You go unconscious.","response":"DM: \"I know the creatures you speak of. I've dealt with my share of duergar, though--\""}

{"prompt":"LAURA: I was? I thought Scanlan was.","response":"DM: Scanlan already made his roll."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What about giving her advantage because I was talking about testicles?","response":"DM: No testicle advantage on that roll. I'm sorry."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: In what circumstance would testicle advantage come into play?\nSAM: At Gilmore's.\nLAURA: That would be 11.","response":"DM: 11? \"Looking at your number, I can see that you've certainly encountered some dangerous things in your travels, taken some losses. And I will say, since you've left, we haven't had at least one excursion interrupting our mine, which has been very helpful. The fact that you've returned with these tales-- I believe most of it. I'd say, given that circumstance, I'd be happy to pay you up to 18,000 gold pieces.\""}

As soon as they left, Trinket and I, we left, and I went to the nearest shop and bought a lot of pink ribbon, and I have been furiously tying bows all through Trinket's hair, the entire time they've been gone.\nMARISHA: Actually I'll help with that campaign. I do some braids, and add some flowers.\nLIAM: Keyleth has been weaving flowers in, and I have been knotting braids.

I have an idea that I want to run by you. No, your name's Scanlan. Okay. I was going to go and do this, just on a whim as I usually do, but I was thinking that we should speak to Allura, and I don't think I should speak to her alone.\nSAM: I'm sorry. I must be asleep. Are you planning something? Ahead of time.\nORION: Yes.\nSAM: Wow. That's amazing!\nORION: You know. Like I told Vax, you just have to chill out sometimes, and I'm like, well, maybe I should run it by the man with the mouth.\nSAM: Well, you've come to the right place. I do have quite a mouth. Yes, let's go talk to her. Wait, she's the woman you fancy quite a bit, isn't that true?\nORION: Yes. This is more business rather than denied pleasure.\nSAM: What do you want to speak with her about?\nORION: Well, as far as I see it, there's no other way to get our carpet reenchanted. I want to confess what we did to her, and hopefully she takes mercy and helps us out with this, as we've helped her out far beyond anything that--","response":"DM: At this point in the discussion, you guys all look up and see, sitting in the center of the main foyer area of Greyskull, a very mighty bear, brought down low, sitting covered in pink ribbons, looking forward, going (distressed bear noises)"}

Trinket, let's go get you a bath.\nTRAVIS: We got so much money.\nLAURA: I go and put it in the party funds. We got our gold.\nSAM: Good job. We can pay back Gilmore.\nLIAM: For my share? Just my share.\nLAURA: Are we splitting up all the party gold now?\nORION: Vex? I give her the picture. Now you have a picture of your bear with the silly bows.\nLAURA: Oh, thank you.\nLIAM: And I take advantage of her good mood and say, I just want 1,200 gold, and I won't ask for any more of it, any of the amount.\nORION: Ooh, yes, I would like the same thing.\nLAURA: Do you want me to just split up all the party gold right now?\nSAM: No, I don't, no.

I'm going to have help. I'm working on project number three.","response":"DM: Okay. This is probably going to take you the rest of the week. It's an extensive project."}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. Yeah, I was going to Frankenstein this.","response":"DM: Okay. We can begin the roll now."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's better. 20.","response":"DM: 20, okay. Not actually doing the charge yet, because you're building the basis of the structure. You help him downstairs in his workshop with the various materials to begin crafting the actual shell of the item. What else are you guys doing?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's go do recon.\nLIAM: Yeah, what are we checking out, though? I mean, it's not like the Briarwoods are out in public. We don't know anything about them.\nLAURA: We need to ask around town about the Briarwoods.\nSAM: We need to get into the Briarwoods' estate and talk to them.\nMARISHA: Well, they're not local. They're coming into town. They're coming into town in five to seven days.","response":"DM: No, they're arriving now in six days and arriving for the actual feast."}

We can't do any spying.\nMARISHA: Not on them.\nORION: All we can do is get gear and do things and we can sleep for a few days.\nTALIESIN: You can help me in the workshop.\nMARISHA: Make a plan. Maybe make a plan? We don't really have a plan.\nLIAM: Can you remind me and the group, the dinner, I know it's with the Briarwoods, but who else? Is it with Uriel or who is it with?","response":"DM: It's with Uriel, the Council, which is why you guys were invited, also because Percy asked. And the Briarwoods. It is partially to discuss and celebrate the agreed-upon construction of a bridge that goes across the Shearing Channel at the far northeastern side of the continent of Tal'Dorei. There is a large channel where these two large mountain ranges, which are the closest the two continents are to each other, but it's a very treacherous pass of water, so any trade having to be done has had to travel southward, in a big arc around the bottom of the island, or via skyship, both very expensive. This bridge will enable a much faster trade route between the two continents, and Whitestone has essentially been in charge of spearheading the construction of this bridge and making this agreement with Uriel, that would be overall helpful for both continents. And since they've agreed upon this, they've been invited here to Emon for the first time to have  dinner with the Council and Uriel to celebrate it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We maybe want to talk to Uriel.\nLAURA: Maybe. Maybe you guys should go, because I want to spend the next few days training Trinket how to roly-poly roll forward and bludgeon people with his armor.\nMARISHA: I mean, the only thing I can think-- Percy. Do you still have an idea of what the Briarwoods look like?\nTALIESIN: Oh yes.\nMARISHA: I could attempt another scrying spell. Could even possibly go to Allura for help and try again.\nTALIESIN: See if Allura will come here, because I want to keep working. And I'll also say we should send word to Uriel that I will not be myself at the--\nSAM: Yes, that might be very strange.\nLAURA: We should maybe send word to him that the Briarwoods should be watched.\nTALIESIN: The less we say, the better.\nMARISHA: What makes you say that?\nLIAM: You think Uriel might be in the Briarwoods' pocket and pass on that we're aware.\nTALIESIN: It would not be the first time.\nLIAM: That's true.\nSAM: Yes, even if you wear this disguise hat, Percy, how are you going to get into this event? It's a private event. You can't just be some random person.\nTALIESIN: I will be with you, and if we can let Uriel know that I am coming under a false pretense.\nSAM: Yeah, but that's going to arouse all kinds of suspicion.\nMARISHA: Exactly, yeah, if we tell Uriel you're coming as someone else, he's going to ask why.\nTALIESIN: He knows that I don't trust them.\nTRAVIS: He does?\nTALIESIN: He does.\nMARISHA: Wait, who was it that came and talked to us? Who was that?","response":"DM: That was Seeker Asum."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I was going to say, it was Seeker Asum, but he didn't say that Uriel had his doubts, he said he had his doubts.\nTALIESIN: So let's let Asum know.\nMARISHA: Let Asum know.\nSAM: Why don't you disguise yourself as--\nTALIESIN: Burt Reynolds.\nSAM: What about Vax? He can sneak in.\nTALIESIN: Will the hat let me choose who I look like?","response":"DM: The hat, like any Minor Illusion spell, you can choose your appearance."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Right, and your voice doesn't change, so you probably don't want to try and sound like Grog all night.\nTALIESIN: Well, I was actually thinking of Pike, but.\nSAM: Ooh, Pike. You could be Pike. You would be a very big Pike.\nLIAM: Percival, there's nothing I want more than for you to take Bad News and unload it on every one of those motherfucking shits, but if you're me and I'm nobody, if I'm a ghost, I can help take out one or two.\nTALIESIN: You'll stick to the shadows, and I'll be you.\nMARISHA: Not to be-- sorry, you were going to say something?\nTALIESIN: No, that's actually a pretty good plan.\nLIAM: How many days left?","response":"DM: Six."}

As long as I don't do anything else and I work on getting the right papers, and no one will know who I am, 100%, but it's six days, so am I shit out of luck? This is why I was talking about it yesterday, motherfuckers.\nTALIESIN: That's okay. It's a good plan. I think this plan is a good plan.\nORION: I think we'll be fine, because I have privilege perk.\nLIAM: You make me invisible.\nSAM: I can also do that. Or he can.\nLIAM: Yeah, one of you two.\nSAM: No problem. I know it's a few days off, but we should have some sort of safe word. Some sort of attack word. Grog, any suggestions?\nTRAVIS: Jenga.\nALL: Jenga.\nMARISHA: I like that. We're not hired to kill the Briarwoods, and not to be that member of the group that has a golden heart and wants to ruin everyone's fun.

Is this going to make you feel better?\nTALIESIN: I don't know what I want. I want to see them. I want to look at them. I want to see them.\nMARISHA: Do you want to talk to them?\nTALIESIN: No. I want to listen to them.\nTRAVIS: Then we follow your lead.\nTALIESIN: I want to see them. I don't know.\nMARISHA: Do you want us to fucking capture them and drag them back to the cell that we built in our keep? We built it for a reason.\nSAM: (whistles) She gambles now. She's crazy.\nMARISHA: I know, I've been opened up to so many things.\nTALIESIN: The best I can give you is we'll just have to see what happens.\nLIAM: Percival, I trust you implicitly. You have earned that trust. Do you believe them to be evil in the purest sense?\nTALIESIN: I do.\nLAURA and LIAM: That's all we need.\nSAM: We don't even need that much. If you'd just said to kill someone, we'd probably do it.\nTALIESIN: I saw things.\nLAURA: Should we prepare? Let's do it!

Only half of it.\nTRAVIS: I just became the most handsome man in the world.\nLAURA: Do not shave his fucking beard off.\nLIAM: This much.","response":"DM: Make a stealth check. Make a perception check. You just broke a mechanical pencil!"}

{"prompt":"LIAM: After the 20?","response":"DM: One thing to not be noticed. It's another to shave someone's face without being noticed. This is about stillness of fingers, not just how stealthy you can be."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm using Luck. Okay, so I rolled a 21.","response":"DM: Roll a perception check, Grog. With advantage because this is against your face."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 13.\nLIAM: 21.\nLAURA: Why are you so evil?\nLIAM: Why did he trip me and make me eat shit two months ago?\nTALIESIN, MARISHA, and ORION: Oh!\nTRAVIS: Appetizer of things to come, my friend.","response":"DM: The crowing sound of a distant rooster. The farmlands that surround the outside of Emon, which are relatively close, within earshot. The morning sun rises, cresting over the eastern skyline of Tal'Dorei.

Why does he know--\nTRAVIS: Because you're the only fucking idiot stupid enough to do that!\nLIAM: Magic is mysterious! Why couldn't you grow half a beard due to magic?\nTRAVIS: Maybe I don't know.

That one was 20.\nTALIESIN: 28.\nTALIESIN: 23.","response":"DM: Okay, so over the next few days, you've constructed what amounts to a large, metallic gauntlet. You have taken this gauntlet and wired all through it insulation and metallic insulating tips in what is essentially a small, for lack of a better term, alternator of some kind."}

It's untested technology, just something that's a brainchild of your own, utilizing Keyleth's aid. Keyleth, I'm going to have you roll a wisdom check. Roll that and add five."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well. Add just my base wisdom?","response":"DM: Plus six, it would be. Sorry."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes, plus six, so 20 total.","response":"DM: 20 total. You step out and you set it down in the middle of the courtyard. Keyleth, you summon a storm that slowly gathers above the top of the keep. You guys start hearing sounds like rolling thunder outside and you come and look, and you see Percy and Keyleth are out standing in the middle of the courtyard. Keyleth with her arm in the air as this black, dark storm cloud begins to swirl above the entirety of Greyskull Keep. With that, she brings her hand up and then brings her fist down as a bolt of energy (thunder clap) streaks down from the clouds, slamming into a small object on the ground that then gets flung about 15 feet in a random direction. Tumbles to the ground. You rush over to grab it. You can see arcing over the metal. (electric sparking) These small electric arcs. You reach over and wait a second. You prod it. Pick it up and it's hot. Drop it instinctively. You give it a few minutes to cool off. Pick it up when it's warm enough; you put it on and there is essentially this large, sparking, metal centerpiece that is giving off this low hum."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Did it work? Try it on Tiberius.\nORION: Sure. Here.\nTALIESIN: Touch.","response":"DM: Okay. Tiberius, make a constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"SAM and ORION: No!\nTALIESIN: Cock-a-dooed. (yelps)\nMARISHA: High rolls startle him.\nTALIESIN: 19.","response":"DM: 19, okay. It stays intact from the force of it. A little bit of the energy that was stored in there appears to dissipate. You figure there's only a few applications of this before it needs to be recharged, and every single time it's utilized, there's a low chance that it may detonate, or crumble, or something bad may happen."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Percy, that's amazing! What do you call it?\nORION: (unintelligible mumbling)\nMARISHA: I go over and give him a Cure Wounds.","response":"DM: You manage to eventually shake off all your muscles that were so locked, tense, give way for a second."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's effective.\nMARISHA: That was awesome.\nTALIESIN: I call it Diplomacy.\nSAM: Diplomacy?\nLAURA: I like it.\nTRAVIS: That's great.\nLAURA: As we're standing watching that, Trinket comes rolling into the courtyard!","response":"DM: Let's go ahead and make an animal handling check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, why didn't I get more points in that?\nLIAM: Roll high. Come on.","response":"DM: I say with advantage because Trinket's been your companion for so long."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Natural 20!","response":"DM: Which is close to what you needed because this is a very difficult feat. Over the week you've worked with Trinket and you've worked on a technique where, instead of a multi-attack, Trinket can do what is essentially a trample attack, meaning Trinket can roll forward and roll through anything that's equal to or smaller. And damage everything in that path."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should we call it the roly-poly or the cannonball?\nTRAVIS: That's your call.","response":"DM: It's your call. Call it what you want."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Roly-poly is cute; cannonball is--\nLAURA: I think I like cannonball because it's better to shout during the battle.","response":"DM: The Trinket cannonball."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Roly-poly!\nORION: For brevity, I rolled six dice. I rolled, the only high ones worth mentioning was a 13, a 15, and 18.","response":"DM: With a 15 and an 18--"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17, I mean.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And the, because they're all negative three. And I attempted to teach to Lockheed to hide and speak and to stay.\nSAM: We'll need fancy robes.\nLAURA: Oh, we have some formal dresses already.","response":"DM: Roll again, please."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 23.","response":"DM: You manage to construct 20 pieces of ammunition from 20 units of materials."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We have three fancy robes.\nORION: Oh, and I've picked up my glaive, right? Two days. It was time to.","response":"DM: You go back to Karin. You now have some kind of a knife-glaive thing."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Krull! I'm naming it Krull.","response":"DM: You are unsure how it will work in combat? But it looks neat."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I attach it to my coat.","response":"DM: It just hangs to the side. Careful how you sit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do I still have the finery I wore to the Velvet Cabaret?","response":"DM: You would, yes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are there any tapestries or curtains in the castle?","response":"DM: There are, actually."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I walk up to the prettiest one and I rip it down, and I throw it over myself like a toga.","response":"DM: It, in a \"Foreigner in a Foreign Land\" kind of way, could work."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And I practice my curtsy. Because I've seen Vex and Keyleth do it, so I think everybody does it.\nORION: I do it, as well. I don't know what's going on.\nTALIESIN: I want to see him roll an athletics check for that.\nLAURA: Tiberius.\nORION: Yes?\nLAURA: Could you Prestidigitate this thing and make it look like an actual thing?\nSAM: Not for very long.","response":"DM: That's more of an illusion."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You pull the hairs out.\nTRAVIS: What's wrong with this? I'm from a strange land. My customs are my own.\nSAM: Grog, have you washed yourself in water at all this week?\nTRAVIS: No. It burns.\nORION: I do Prestidigitation immediately to get rid of some kind of smell that I'm sure is emanating.\nTRAVIS: I freak out running around the room. (screams)\nORION: It's not water, Grog. And I keep casting it on him. It's fine, see. (splash)\nLAURA: You're fine.\nTRAVIS: It must have been that powder you gave me before. It made me immune.\nLAURA: That's what it was. You're immune. You're definitely immune to water now. Good job.\nORION: What's wrong with what you're wearing now?\nLAURA: His toga? He's wearing a toga made out of a tapestry.\nORION: Oh, so I'll go and I'll use some of my Dust of Illusion and I'll (pfft) on what he's wearing and shape it into a fancier robe.","response":"DM: From a visual standpoint, the robe tapers and curls around his form, and comes to look like a nicer robe. The material looks like it's made of almost a reddish silk. The actual imagery of the tapestry slowly fades and becomes just various textures and material. From your eyes, it's less interesting, but from a presentory standpoint it could be passable."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Don't forget his exotic facial hair, as well. That probably lends to the whole package.","response":"DM: Yeah, which by the way, you guys do see. It's half giant beard and half scrawled-on charcoal."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I notice this, I go: Oh. Oh, Grog. And I use a little bit more of Dust of Illusion. I wipe it. Smear it on there.\nTRAVIS: I wipe it away!\nORION: No. Stop! Hey, hey, hey-- I put it on. Actually, I'm going to take it, and I'm going to actually put it in your hand and be like-- put it on your thumb and be like: I want you to smear this where the beard was, and I want you to think really hard that you want it there. Okay? So put it on first. There you go. That's it. And now think really hard that you want it there.","response":"DM: The dust tends to glisten, and where there was once charcoal outline, a mirror to your once beautiful beard continues, full, as if nothing had happened."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I reach into the bag of holding and I take out a little goblet, and I pour some ale in it. And I walk over to Vax, and I go, here you go.\nLIAM: This looks very good. Thank you, Grog.\nTRAVIS: You're welcome. Would you like some more?\nLIAM: No, I don't want to cloud my thinking before we go up against the Briarwoods.\nTRAVIS: Probably smart. I'll take that back. I crush the goblet in my hand.","response":"DM: This creaking metal sound. The goblet is now destroyed."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh no! What happened?\nSAM: Well, are you in disguise yet, Percy?\nTALIESIN: Yes, I look like Vax.\nSAM: Cloaked Vax?\nLIAM: Where are we?","response":"DM: You guys are nearing the palace right now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Nearing the palace? Hit me.\nMARISHA: I produce a few flower cummerbunds and start pinning them on the party.\nLAURA: I go in and put my arm through Percy's arm to make it seem like we're twins. I go in with Percy to make it look like we're the twinsies.\nSAM: I'm going to cast Invisibility on Vax.\nTRAVIS: I hand the Potion of Climbing to Vax and say, don't die.\nLIAM: No promises.\nSAM: You've got one hour until my Invisibility is going to wear off, so find a shadow.","response":"DM: Do you guys make yourselves known at the palace front?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes! We're friends here. Yes.","response":"DM: As you approach, you make yourselves known. The guards lead you to the front area of the palace. The sun's just starting to hit the distant side of the water of the Ozmit Sea to the west of Emon. As you guys finish talking to the front guard that you've arrived, Seeker Asum steps out of the front of the palace and sees you. \"Very good. Glad you could make it. Please enter. I will wish to speak with you briefly before the event this evening.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course.","response":"DM: \"Are you missing anyone?\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, yes. Percy wasn't feeling very well. He ended up staying home.","response":"DM: Make a deception check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 11.","response":"DM: \"Very well. That's unfortunate. His skills could have been of use to me. Come inside.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I pat Vax's hand-- Percy's hand. What the fuck. This is creepy.\nTRAVIS: Call him Vaxy.\nLAURA: Vaxy.\nTALIESIN: That will work just fine. Thank you.","response":"DM: \"This is a political dinner. Please do your best not to cause a scene during the meal, as I need that time as a distraction to do my own digging.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: \"Vax.\""}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes?","response":"DM: \"You're light of step and quick to fade. Would you wish to join me on this or stay with the dinner party?\""}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll stay with the dinner party. I wish to observe.\nSAM: He also has a bit of a cold.\nTALIESIN: I wish to observe the Briarwoods myself.","response":"DM: Make a deception check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (gritty voice) I wish to observe.\nLIAM: You've got to go more nasal, Taliesin.\nTALIESIN: Yes, nasal.\nORION: Yes, you need to go down here.\nSAM: Sort of like sandpaper on a chalkboard.\nMARISHA: I should have done something about this.\nTALIESIN: Five.\nORION: Well, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.\nSAM: This is not Vax.\nTALIESIN: Asum, it's me.","response":"DM: \"I gathered as much, as soon as you began to speak. Now, I can understand, based on our previous conversation, that you have interest in keeping low key, but know that I am an ally in this. If you're not here, where is the rest of your party. Where is Vax?\""}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Vax is here.\nLAURA: He's stealthing.\nTALIESIN: He's being quiet.\nMARISHA: What are the names of these people who've taken over White--\nLAURA: It was the Briarwoods.","response":"DM: \"I don't. The Briarwoods have.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I thought they said they had friends.","response":"DM: \"I do not know yet. I've sent folks out there. Those who have been sent to Whitestone have either defected or quit and sent me letters of resignation which is part of the reason I am very curious as to what's going on in Whitestone. Now, I've also found the documentation that delivered the ungoverned lands of Whitestone to the Briarwoods was signed, officiated and cataloged months in advance to the de Rolo family passing. I'm still following the trail but I find the  timing far too convenient. With their arrival coming up, please be controlled, remember what I've told you and as more information comes in in the passing weeks I'll bring that to your attention, as well. Be observant, listen, pry what information you can, but do not raise suspicion.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: We will be as quiet as a house mouse. However, if you need us to act, just utter the word \"jenga.\"","response":"DM: \"Jenga.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I also make a matching corsage and pin it on his lapel, as well.","response":"DM: As you do, he looks down at it and goes, \"Thank you; it's not my color.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You know, that's fine.\nMARISHA: It might have had a more utilitarian purpose, but it's fine.","response":"DM: \"I'm not going to be at the dinner, but thank you.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do you have any of your people learning about the Briarwoods? Are they magic users in any way? Have you heard anything?","response":"DM: \"The only thing I can recall as the information of the Briarwoods, at least what's come this way was while they were ruling the lands in Wildemount as part of their kingdom there, Lady Delilah Briarwood was an accomplished practitioner of the arcane arts, a long-trained wizard as far as I know and been through quite a few different schools and had a brief stint here in Emon training at the Lyceum, but that was naught but nine, ten years back? Maybe more.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do any of you know, as somebody practiced in the arcane arts, are you good at seeing through illusions? Or--\nSAM: Who, me? Who, us?\nLAURA: Anybody that is, you know, very skilled?\nORION: (chuckles) Of course. I just need to know that one's happening. So it's tricky, is what I'm saying.\nLAURA: So she wouldn't automatically know. They wouldn't be able to spot immediately that Percy is not actually--\nORION: Somebody would have to have rather powerful abilities to see through an illusion spell like a disguise or such. It's like a rakshasa could see though that kind of thing, per experience. I doubt that the Briarwoods have any--","response":"DM: At which point you hear, muffled in the distance a (horn noise) this horn sound that seems to be blown as a notification that the arrival of guests has rolled in."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are you ready for this, Vaxy?\nTALIESIN: No. Let's do this.\nORION: Would you like me to cast Fireball?","response":"DM: Asum goes, \"No, please, none of that. Vax, if you can hear me in this room, ten minutes into the meal see if you can spot me and follow me in the foyer. Good luck.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Great.\nSAM: Keyleth, I hope you phoned ahead and gave them your order for a vegan meal.\nMARISHA: Oh, I always do.\nTALIESIN: She's vegan. Of course she told them.\nMARISHA: Exactly. It's on the RSVP.","response":"DM: Asum leaves the room. Do you wish to stay inside, do you wish to see the guests as they arrive?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's go be social.\nSAM: Let's go mingle.\nLAURA: So wonderful to see you. I give her a hug.","response":"DM: She gives a little hug, too. Glances over at you. \"A pleasure, Vax'ildan.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: See? She can see it.\nMARISHA: Yes, she can.","response":"DM: What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: You look gorgeous Allura, and my friends are just making weird faces right now. It's probably because of how beautiful you look.","response":"DM: As you guys are having this discussion about 15 feet from you the Briarwoods enter the palace, their guards enter with them. There's been no pleasantry and very much an intended arrival. None of you are recognizable to them, thus they make no intent of introducing themselves."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We catch any of their eye at all?","response":"DM: They appear to be looking about and taking in their surroundings but they're both engaged in a mumbled conversation between the two of them as they enter."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is anyone waiting to greet them?","response":"DM: As you follow where they're going, as you walk into the main foyer area where you stand there, waiting carefully at the back, there are a number of servants that have arrived and have taken some of their bags and help them up the stairs. There is one, the head servant who is there talking to them and you hear him speaking to them. \"Wait in your quarters be ready, the meal should be ready within the hour. If you would be so kind as to prepare yourselves, relax, unwind, set up your rooms. You're to stay for a few days at the very least. But we shall call you when the meal is ready.\" At which Lord Sylas Briarwood turns to him and says, \"I greatly appreciate the information. Just come to our room and let us know when the food is ready. Now, come, my dear\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I keep an eye on them as they're walking to their room? Just as long as I can see their mouths moving, I can read their lips.\nTALIESIN: I also want to scan their entourage to see if I recognize any faces.","response":"DM: Okay, perception check. Perception check for you, as well."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do I have to perceive it? I have a feat that I can read it.","response":"DM: Oh, you do?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, I have Observant: Read Lips meaning I can read lips from any language I can understand.","response":"DM: That's true. Okay, good to know."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 19.\nORION: I flirt with Allura.","response":"DM: Okay, do you want to talk with Allura?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I flirt with her throughout the hour.\nORION: Actually, towards the end of that conversation I would like to bring up a specific thing. We've been having such a wonderful conversation.","response":"DM: \"Of course, no, of course, Tiberius\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: I think when things settle down a bit, perhaps you and I and maybe Grog, and Lady Kima can perhaps go out. Break bread and have some wine and such on an evening with each other. I believe my friend rather fancies Kima. What say you?","response":"DM: \"Well, that's very flattering, Tiberius. I appreciate the invitation. I would say that particular mix of company might prove a bit awkward.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, of course. If it was awkward, nobody wants that.","response":"DM: \"Perhaps we might-- I mean if you would like to get some tea sometime I'd be more than happy to--\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, just you and I?","response":"DM: \"Yes. Kima's quite a ways off and I believe she's still in Vasselheim, last I spoke with her, and yes, tea would be lovely.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: You walk away.\nORION: I walk away.\nMARISHA: He got a date!\nTRAVIS: Is that carriage. Is the carriage still there?","response":"DM: The carriage, as far as you see, is being led off slowly by the servants to a side area of the palace."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And the armed on horseback that were with the Briarwoods when they came in?","response":"DM: Two of them are with the Briarwoods, and there are two helping to bring their stuff up to their rooms."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The four are with them?","response":"DM: The four are with them, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I jump up and give him a little high five. Then, as an hour has passed, I beckon to Vax and find a shadowy area.\nTRAVIS: Real Vax or Vaxy?\nSAM: Real Vax. Because my thing is wearing off, buddy.\nMARISHA: I've been scanning the crowd. Have I noticed anything over the past hour of any of our people? Any locals, any council members, who may be acting a little shifty?","response":"DM: Looking about, the council is roughly stepping in and out of the area like they're getting ready for the dinner and arriving from the Cloudtop district."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Any of them breaking a sweat? Acting weird?\nLAURA: Yeah. I want to check out this, too.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an insight roll, both of you guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 22.\nLAURA: 23.","response":"DM: The two of you scanning over. Looking over there is Lord Riskel Daxio, he's an elven male, who was the one who is master of trade of the city. He's the one that handled the ordering of your keep when you first had it brought to your attention by Uriel. Allura, of course. Tofor Brotorus is there, the female dragonborn paladin. She seems generally just not happy about the whole scenario and she's not armored, she's dressed in what would be considered formal attire but it's not a dress, it's not a suit, it's this asexual formal outfit that looks like a robe but also like a suit and she does not look to be happy in it at all. Just arms crossed, at the far end, back against the wall just (growling noises) slowly stewing, not wanting to be there. You also see Arbiter Brom Goldhand, who is the master of law. Was previously one of the heads of the guard there within Emon and then was then given the job of being the head of the Watchful Hall. He's the master of law essentially in the city. That's right, Tofor is the master of defense that took over for Krieg after Krieg was slain. So those are the council members. Most everyone else there you see are servants. As time goes on eventually there is the ringing of a dinner bell down the hallway and everyone turns their head and notices and steps over to the great hall of the palace where the feast is to be given to you and other guests."}
{"prompt":"SAM: As we move, I release and then recast Invisibility on him when I see that there's a moment where everyone's distracted.\nMARISHA: Oh look, Tiberius, they have bananas!\nORION: Oh!\nLAURA: I can sense you, you dick.","response":"DM: You're escorted to the hall by Allura. She keeps chatting with you guys and asking questions about how Vasselheim was, and is Kima well? She stayed back there. She asks questions about why Pike isn't here and you tell her the story that she stayed behind and everything. You make your way into the great hall which seats a vast number of people. There are five major tables meant for like large feasts but there is one central square table in the far end that is by this giant hearth. This fireplace is probably a good six feet high and about 12 feet wide. It's a grandiose visual on the far end of this hall, and there's a long table right there set for about 20 people. You don't know if there will be that many there at the table but it can seat that many. At which point, all the different members of the council have their seats around it. You guys find your seats."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we get a feel for where the Briarwoods are going to sit?","response":"DM: With this many seats set, it's hard to tell, but you gather that they're probably going to sit--"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Can I position myself when I sit to where I can see them? So I can read their mouths, specifically.","response":"DM: Certainly. You can probably sit on the center or the far end of the table looking in their direction, should be fine."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Can I sit at the far end of the table at the very opposite end, if not at head of the end--\nLAURA: That's probably where Uriel is going to sit.\nORION: Oh. Who?\nTRAVIS: The king.\nORION: Oh! Not that chair.","response":"DM: Okay, but adjacent to it?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes. That would be rude, I think.","response":"DM: Okay, fair enough."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I assume I sit at the kiddie table because I'm so tiny?\nLAURA: They've got a booster chair for you, Scanlan.\nSAM: I am risen already. I'm standing already.","response":"DM: Lord and Lady Briarwood now enter arm in arm, slowly walking from the far end of the great hall. They make their way to one end of the table. They both wordlessly sit down, smiling and acknowledge everyone at the table. There's a moment of silence and then another servant says \"And would all please attention be given to our sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei the second and the Empress Salda Tal'Dorei.\" At which point, the sovereign and his wife enter from the same entrance point. Everyone stands up from their chair, waits for them to get to the edge of the table, at which point they nod their head. Everyone gives a low bow. You guys follow suit, following the social graces you're not familiar with but trying to learn as you go. Except for Tiberius, you know this deal. You all follow his lead on this. Eventually, everyone sits down again. Tables are pushed in by servants behind you, you're like 'oh' caught off guard by the whole experience. Uriel looks about the table with a smile, shoulder length brown hair and his chin goatee very well crafted into almost a point now. He looks about the table. \"Thank you, Lord and Lady Briarwood, for making the journey across the lands so that we might meet in person, finally. Please, allow me to introduce our dining party and esteemed council of Tal'Dorei.\" He goes around the table introducing, \"Arbiter Brom Goldhand. He is the master of law of our city, and is responsible for maintaining all of these grand people of our fair town in the realm of safety and order. We have Lord Riskel Daxio. He is our head of planning and construction; has overseen many of the expansions of the city, and is a trusted friend of mine. We have the Arcanist Allura Vysoren: one of my trusted advisors, one of the greatest arcane minds of all of Tal'Dorei, and the overseer of all things arcane within our city. We have the Guardian Tofor Brotorus, a fierce warrior and currently the master of defense in our city and hopefully for a long time to come.\" Tofor gives a (scoffs) sound and everyone is put off by it, but they're also seemingly used to it. \"Arbiter Brom Goldhand: master of law. My lovely wife, the Empress Salda. We have here within our midst, as well: Vox Machina, a team of intrepid adventurers who rose up and saved my family's life and very well the city of Emon and have since proven very useful to our territory. Grog Strongjaw, a goliath of interesting dress, but strong of heart and blade. We have Vex'ahlia, half-elven maiden with a bow as swift as the fastest eagle.\" Looking next, he says, \"We have here Vax'ildan, blades quick and eyes sharp, not a whisper passes his ear. Ah! There you are! Scanlan Shorthalt, a performer known far and wide. A wit as clever as you've ever seen. His songs are whispered through taverns across the land. We have Tiberius Stormwind--\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm from Draconia.","response":"DM: \"Hailing from Draconia, which,\" he looks across to the Briarwoods, \"the kingdom you hail from originally not being far off from Draconia, perhaps you've had some dealings with the Stormwinds?\" And the Briarwoods give a nod. \"Yes, we have seen them in the past. We've heard many good things.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: We're pretty cool.","response":"DM: \"We have over here, Keyleth of the Ashari, if I am correct on that? She is a denizen of the natural lands and protector of all things nature within Tal'Dorei.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hi.","response":"DM: \"There was one more.\""}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Two, and they could not be in attendance.\nLAURA: Yes, ill.\nORION: They were running around. They got diarrhea. Isn't that what you said?\nSAM: Yes.\nLIAM: While all this is going on, can you describe. Are the Briarwood couple together, seated next to each other?","response":"DM: They are seated right next to each other at the head of one table across the way."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I intend to be behind them, but what's behind them, like?","response":"DM: What's behind them is just open space and servants. There's probably a good 25 servants here that are just like sitting there patiently, lying in wait for--"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And behind the servants is a wall so there's lots of open busy crowded space? Okay.","response":"DM: And tables. There's like other unused tables in this great hall that are just out there. Four other ones."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just to see if they seem like sacks of shit.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Luck, oh not that lucky. This is going to be very low. Yeah, never mind, low. Very low.","response":"DM: It's hard to tell from this distance really at all. They're very charming. You were expecting this very dour, dark, evil couple from all the conversation, but they seem nice. They seem earnest. They keep to themselves definitely, they're definitely a very tight couple but nothing about them catches you off guard as being anything instinctively twisted."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's very hard to read them upside-down.\nLAURA: Could I inquire to Lady Briarwood?","response":"DM: You're saying this out loud? The conversation comes to a halt, she-- \"Yes, of course. I'm so sorry, what was your name again?\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Vex'ahlia.","response":"DM: \"Vex'ahlia. Absolute pleasure to meet you. Delilah.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You as well. I notice your dress is quite lovely. It doesn't look like a fashion that I'm used to seeing. Where do you hail from originally?","response":"DM: \"We hail from Wildemount. It's quite a ways from here. The continent to the far east.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Really, I'm not familiar.","response":"DM: \"You should come by sometime. We haven't been home in a number of years, having to tend to Whitestone, but we have quite an elaborate homestead there. We'd love to have you come stay with us if you ever find yourself in that side of the world.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I would love to visit. How long have you been at Whitestone?","response":"DM: \"We've been at Whitestone for the better part of-- I can't even remember.\" And Lord Briarwood looks, he goes, \"Best I can recall, four or five years. It was an unfortunate mantle to pick up but we've done what we can in honor of the passed de Rolo family.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, sorry.\nORION: I was just going to ask, you seem such a lovely couple. Do you have any children?","response":"DM: \"We unfortunately do not. It seems it was not in the cards for us to bear. However, we consider many of our esteemed servants and house guests our extended family. So we can leave a legacy, however we can possibly do so.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we insight check as, what they're saying?","response":"DM: Certainly."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I mean, I know they're lying out their asses. Fuck. 18.","response":"DM: 18? Seems pretty earnest."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Lord Briarwood. Down here, hi.","response":"DM: \"I'm sorry, I--\" he snaps and a servant moves a large like pig platter out of the way that was blocking your head from his vision."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You can move that over here actually, thank you. (chomping noises)\nSAM: Lord Briarwood, we may share a mutual friend or acquaintance of some sort. My father was a prominent doctor, and he may have studied medicine with a fellow that you know named Dr. Ripulah, Ripley? Dr. Ripley? Do you know such a person?","response":"DM: \"Yes, actually. Dr. Ripley is one of our esteemed physicians in Whitestone. Yes, recently come into some land herself, although she has been on holiday for some time. Following her own research as doctors are wont to do.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are you close with her?","response":"DM: \"I wouldn't say close, but she's been a friend at times, and she was one of the few that came with us from Wildemount over to Whitestone and has helped us restructure and maintain and help facilitate the blossoming of a city without a leader.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: She sounds wonderful. Well, when you see her next tell her that my father, Dr. Jeff Shorthalt, said hi.","response":"DM: \"Jeff Shorthalt, I will be happy to pass that along.\""}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Lord Briarwood, I am not familiar with Whitestone. How did you become caretaker of such a place?\nORION: That is so courageous of you. Do you want me to Fireball her now?\nTALIESIN: A toast, then!","response":"DM: \"A toast.\""}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: To gracious hosts.","response":"DM: \"To gracious hosts.\""}
{"prompt":"SAM: L'Chaim.\nORION: Gesundheit.","response":"DM: \"So. Uriel,\" and he looks across the way and says, \"one of our largest exports in Whitestone is timber from the forests and woods that surround Whitestone and the Alabaster Sierras. We've had a rising danger in the surrounding woods. It has made it proven difficult to export most of these wooded goods. If it is possible, we would like for you to send some aid, perhaps a small band of soldiers to lead a strike into the woods.\" Uriel looks across the way and says, \"Ah yes, we can definitely discuss that, I don't see why not. We are currently in peacetime and we have a reserve of soldiers we can send your way.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I mean, we're also free.\nSAM: Oh yes.","response":"DM: As the meal continues on, more conversations arise. A lot of bureaucratic BS. Anyone want to interject anything or ask any questions?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is Allura there, still?","response":"DM: Allura is there, yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: As we're eating I'm going to: By the way, did you ever perhaps finish making that extra earring I gave you several weeks ago? I don't know how long it's been.","response":"DM: Allura looks, glances over to the side and says, \"Yes, it's been completed. No one's come by to take it from me\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: I had no idea, I'll send someone.","response":"DM: \"And as a note, I'm about a month away from completing the sigil in the basement of your keep.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, wonderful. Thank you, that's-- so talented. What flavor tea do you like, Allura?","response":"DM: \"I prefer a mint or jasmine, to be honest.\""}
{"prompt":"ORION: Noted. I walk away","response":"DM: You step up and walk away from the dinner table. (chair scraping) Tiberius stands up in the middle of the discussion and walks away from the feast."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Lady Briarwood, it is such an act of compassion to take on such responsibility as a house such as Whitestone.\nSAM: Tiberius, get back here.\nORION: You said walk away.\nSAM: No! Not every time!","response":"DM: \"Well, thank you. This is the first time we've been away from Whitestone in many years.\""}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's such a spectacular act of kindness and generosity. Would, perhaps, Vox Machina also be of service to you?","response":"DM: \"Perhaps, you seem strong of build and--\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We are handier than we look.\nMARISHA: We killed a beholder once.\nTRAVIS: Just right out with it.","response":"DM: \"That is an impressive feat, young Keyleth.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We should just lead with that.\nTALIESIN: And we killed an illithid once, as well.","response":"DM: \"Slain a beholder? Uriel, you keep in the presence of some mighty heroes.\" Uriel goes, (chuckles) \"They are proven allies. I mean, if you utilize their assistance. That would be very possible. May have something coming up that I could use them for myself, but we'll discuss in time. Nevertheless, the meal continues.\" She smiles and looks back at you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do an insight check to see if that look at Percy-not-Percy was--","response":"DM: You can make an insight check, sure."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Can you? Can you make an insight check? I don't think you can.\nMARISHA: She looked interesting.","response":"DM: You're distracted by the pattern, the brocade across her torso area."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You know, you could roll lower if you tried.\nORION: I want to do an arcana check on them.","response":"DM: What are you checking for?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: If they're armed with anything that has arcane properties.","response":"DM: Make an arcana check. It's not so much something you can sense, more than you can look for symbols. You rolled a 17? It looks like there are elements of their accoutrements that are, like any of you are carrying on yourselves. There's a choker that's part of the outfit that Lady Briarwood wears that itself does appear to have some tiny enchantment-based markings across it. They are adorned in various protective magic, but so is everybody else at the table."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Got you. Standard gear.\nTRAVIS: Lord and Lady Briarwood, we are, in fact, quite handy. Vax, we also killed an illithid, if I recall.\nTALIESIN: I think we did. Did we befriend an illithid or kill it? I think we did both.\nORION: We befriended it, it betrayed us, and then we killed it.\nSAM: But enough about us. Earlier, you were telling us about a poor family that came down with that disease. I'm just curious, coming from a medical family. What was the disease that they had?","response":"DM: They look at each other and give a sorrowful look. \"We do not know. We were only given the information that the family had passed, but a month or two after it had already occurred.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The entire family. All of them?","response":"DM: \"Most of the castle seemed to have fallen to it, as well.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So dreadful.\nLAURA: I know how hard it is to lose someone very close to you. I'm sorry for your loss.\nMARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm just a little confused. If the whole family died of disease, weren't you afraid to go into this town, into this castle? Weren't you afraid of contracting this disease yourself?","response":"DM: \"There was worry of such a thing, but before Whitestone castle could be entered, we made sure to send in our best clerics to rid of any existing possible lingering disease, and to make sure to remove any corpses or bodies that may contain it. There was a period of time that we were worried, but after a few months, we came to the conclusion that we were safe, and thus we moved our way in.\""}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Lucky for you.\nSAM: Anyone care for some games of jenga?","response":"DM: At this point, the dessert has been brought out. It's a fine, almost creme brulee-type dish. It's delicious."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are they whispering to themselves, still?","response":"DM: As part of the discussions, there are a few side exchanges here and there. The best you can make from it is, \"Did you notice him?\" She says, \"Yes, don't worry.\" And, \"Tonight, we'll stay.\" And those are the only things you can make out from the exchanges back and forth."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How long do you plan on staying here, Lord and Lady?","response":"DM: \"Well, after this dinner, I imagine a few days, and we'll be on our way. We're merely here to finalize the paperwork for the bridge construction.\" She looks over and gives a nod to Lord Daxio, who gives her a nod back. \"And maybe see the city for a while, and make our way back. It's too hard to be away, and our nephew has been left in charge of this.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do you have plans on the morrow? I would love to give you a tour of the city.","response":"DM: \"That would be lovely.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wonderful! Should I send word? How should we arrange this?","response":"DM: \"Where are you staying?\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We are outside of town at our own keep, actually.","response":"DM: \"What's it called?\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The Greyskull Keep.","response":"DM: \"Greyskull Keep. We will have you sent for when the time is right.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lovely. That will be so fun.\nORION: Vex is so into showing people our city.\nLAURA: Perhaps you can show me some more of your fashions. I love your dress so much.","response":"DM: \"Oh, well it's hard to show you this here. What you need to see is the Wildemount fashion district. It is divine.\""}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sounds wonderful.\nTRAVIS: I look at Vax and I go, does anyone want any dessert?\nORION: (gulping) I'm having a little.\nLAURA: Vax? You looked at Vax?\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Vaxy. The one that I can look at.\nORION: Do you want dessert now? Would you like this fireball creme brulee?\nTALIESIN: I'm just fine.\nMARISHA: (whispered) I don't know what to do now.","response":"DM: The meal has been now wound down, the dishes are being gathered by the servants, the wine has stopped being poured, and now everyone settles in with sighs of a meal well spent. The other council members begin to excuse themselves. Uriel stands up and says, \"My apologies, me and my wife find that rest is in our future. Please, feel free to walk the halls as you see fit. Thank you again, Lord and Lady Briarwood, for joining us, and we're excited to continue this venture. Good night to you all.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hey, you should Hunter's Mark them or something.\nSAM: Wait, no, that's Uriel that's leaving.\nLIAM: What's the gentleman who realized that I was there? Earlier, before we came in?","response":"DM: Asum? He's not in the room. He's been waiting in the foyer for you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He was telling you to meet him in the foyer, a long time ago.\nLAURA: (whispered) You should go spy on their room. Go check out that room. I'll distract them.\nTRAVIS: (muffled) Go see if he's still there.","response":"DM: Lord and Lady Briarwood also stand up. \"On that note as well, I think our meal has come to an end. We appreciate your--\" and Lady Briarwood continues the sentence, and we wish you all a fine night--\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm clicking my Boots of Haste and scuttling along the ceiling back towards the door.\nSAM: I play a little flute.","response":"DM: They both sit and watch for a moment--"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (Star Wars Cantina song)\nLIAM: Am I finding what's-his-face?","response":"DM: You make your way out, and he's not there. You don't see him anywhere."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm doubling back.","response":"DM: Okay, you double back. After about a minute of this, \"Yes, well, thank you kindly for that wondrous display. I feel that sleep takes us, and we are going to retire to our quarters. Have a wonderful night, everyone.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Are you staying within the castle?","response":"DM: \"Yes, yes.\""}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh! Fantastic.\nORION: Have a wonderful rest.","response":"DM: \"And good night.\" And they both stand up, and then they make their way out, through the main great hall exit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm following.","response":"DM: Okay. You gather across the ceiling as you go. You watch them head up the stairway to the second floor. They head to the right, down a long hallway, a series of doors. They come up to a door, where there are two guards standing outside. The same guards that led them inside the building, and were riding on horseback."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Could I Hunter's Mark him before they go in their bedroom?","response":"DM: Hunter's Mark is technically a minor spell. You could try it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I mean they're walking away, when their back is turned, could I do it when they're not paying attention?","response":"DM: I'd say, make a stealth check. Trying to do this subtly at the table."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 20!","response":"DM: You Hunter's Mark which one?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lord-- no--\nSAM: Sylas or Delilah?\nLAURA: Delilah.","response":"DM: Okay, you mark Delilah as she walks off. You have a sense of where she is at all times in the vicinity. As you follow them, they go to the door, the guards open the door for them, and lead them into their room, and then close the door."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't know what else to do, you guys.\nSAM: Burn their room down. We've got to find Seeker Assam, or whatever his name is.\nLIAM: I yank off my serpent belt and throw it as far as I can. Not as far as I can. 20 feet, and set it in motion, so there's now a snake in the hall, 20 feet in front of these guys.\nORION: If he does an action, it dissipates the spell. It's not Greater Invisibility, so he goes uninvisible, when he does something.","response":"DM: \"Attacks or casts a spell.\" It's not either of those. It's activating an item. You take the belt (whoosh), fling it (hissing), the snake appears to the side. One of the guards looks over. Looks over at the other guard, he pulls out his weapon and one of the guards steps over to where the serpent is and starts trying to stomp it out, and it nips up and gets some of the armor, and he's just, stomping out the snake."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So one's 20 feet away now?","response":"DM: About 25 feet away, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 25 feet away, and one guy stayed?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Kill them.\nLIAM: I drop, and I'm going to bean him on the head, like his name is Kynan.\nLIAM: Okay. \"Advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet.\"","response":"DM: And he is surprised, because he does not know you're there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I'm invisible, so that's an 18. That is 29 to hit. Using the blunt end! I just want to knock him out.","response":"DM: Right, okay. Go ahead and roll sneak attack damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Doubled. 12, 17, 23, 24, 26, so 52. Plus-- No, I mean, if I am as skilled a rogue as I am, how could I not just want to knock somebody out, and not unintentionally-- ten. On top of the 52.","response":"DM: 62 damage will do it. You (whack) right to the side of the helmet, with a dull (thud) sound. Just falls like a sack of potatoes right against the wall."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hand on the door. Is it locked?","response":"DM: The door is currently not locked. You can see the guard you just knocked out, had the key in his hand and was in the process of going to lock the door right when that happened."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so I flip my hood over my head, and I quietly go in the door.\nSAM: Oh wait, you're not invisible anymore.\nLIAM: Yeah, I know.","response":"DM: Okay. So. (creak) You open the door and enter the room, closing it behind you. As soon as you enter the room, it's a large guest room. There are two windows across the way with curtains drawn to the side. You can see the darkness of the night sky behind that, and the rest of the low-lit Cloudtop District visible, and the courtyard surrounding the palace. Immediately to the right and left of you, you see two large tables that are covered in black cloths, that are just, tables to be, you know, vases and stuff set up on them. One's clean, one has actual decor on it. There are two wooden tables immediately to the right and left of you. There's a large red rug, central to the floor, that is circular, and on the far corners next to the two windows you see armoires, like dressers, for clothing and such. In the center of the room, you see, on top of the rug, against the wall between the two windows is a large canopy bed, very beautifully carved from dark wood, has a purple cloth silk canopy that drifts down around it. And on the far end, you can see now, against one of the tables, is Lady Briarwood is currently taking jewelry off of one of her arms while Lord Briarwood is right by the bed, holding on to the post, like he's just walked over to that area."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: They're both at the bed?","response":"DM: They're both at the bed."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I got a 25 for stealth and it didn't work?","response":"DM: They're both looking in your direction."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll use my last Luck of the day. Didn't do it; same thing. Nine, 11.","response":"DM: 11?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.\nLIAM: Yes ma'am.","response":"DM: \"What do you do for the city, if I may ask?\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, I'm a guard. I mean, there's not really a name for what I do. I work for Uriel, I just-- I'm security, ma'am, and I thought I heard a noise in here. And I heard a body fall, I thought-- sounded like a body fell.","response":"DM: They both step a little bit closer. Looking at you--"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm backing up as I'm talking, I'm right at the door! I didn't shut it behind me, I just cracked it open.","response":"DM: Right. Lady Briarwood goes, \"You look strangely similar to a gentleman we just had dinner with.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's crazy!","response":"DM: \"It's uncanny how similar you look.\""}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yep.","response":"DM: (arcane chanting)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I run!","response":"DM: You get to make a wisdom save, is what you do."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Jenga!\nLIAM: Not good. It's an eight.","response":"DM: You turn to move and your muscles (crunching) tense up, as you're unable to physically move."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is awkward, ma'am, I'm just trying to do my job.","response":"DM: You're halfway through the doorway, stuck in place, as she keeps walking forward now, giving you a curious look. Lord Briarwood comes and flanks you from the other side. (clicks tongue) \"You try and flee. I'm merely asking you questions. Come, let us discuss in more private quarters.\" And you feel the hand of Lord Briarwood slam onto your other shoulder. \"Don't worry. You look delicious.\" And he pulls you into the room as she closes the door behind, and that's where we're going to end tonight's session."}
{"prompt":"(screaming)\nSAM: Jenga! We had a safe word for a reason!\nLIAM: That's cool.\nTRAVIS: Hashtag Save Vax!\nMARISHA: Dude, I think they're into some weird shit.","response":"DM: That was a very slow tension building episode that turned very interesting at the end. How you doing, Taliesin?!"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (yells and groans)\nLAURA: They're so evil!\nMARISHA: They're creeping me out, man.\nTALIESIN: You're making it so much worse than I ever imagined.\nLAURA: They're totally vampires.\nMARISHA: Now we're going to have to rescue Vax.\nTALIESIN: I swear if the Briarwoods are responsible for a party kill, I'm going to feel like such an asshole.\nMARISHA: Oh, please, like you haven't rushed into a situation before, Orion?\nORION: No! I never have. I can actually say that.\nLIAM: Like attacking an inanimate door?\nMARISHA: Yeah! Or, or launching a Fireball in the middle of a wood house?\nTALIESIN: Trying to convince an entire army of illithid to follow you?\nMARISHA: Yeah! Rushing off to Draconia to buy a Bag of Holding.\nSAM: Or just today, running off to the, to the sigil!\nORION: Never put myself in danger except for the illithid. Never put myself in danger. The fire thing. Now granted, I didn't know how Fireball worked at the time.\nLIAM: I'm sorry you're such a nervous fellow!\nORION: I'm just saying!\nLAURA: Oh hey, what's going on?\nLIAM: Come on, how am I going to play my second character unless I die now?\nTALIESIN: Or you could become a vampire! You can be a vampire half-elf.\nLIAM: I regret nothing.","response":"DM: As you shouldn't! That got really interesting really fast."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah. I regret zip.\n[end of transcription]","response":"DM: And welcome back."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We all trade seats and then come back really quickly.","response":"DM: It's pretty good. We started doing burpees in between. No, I mean, we just burp."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Basically, just burp a lot.\nLIAM: Hey, the gnome is at the door. Can someone let the gnome in?","response":"DM: Bring in the gnome!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you desire a gnome, sire?","response":"DM: I would like the gnome brought before me."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Bring the king a gnome! Make sure he is of foul mouth and many a song.\nLIAM: Oh, fetching the gnome!\nTRAVIS: I assure you, sire, this gnome has many songs, a very tiny instrument, and–\nTALIESIN: I feel so dirty sitting on this pillow. So comfy.\nORION: I like it.\nLAURA: Does somebody have an extra pencil?\nTALIESIN: Yeah.\nLAURA: All I have is this broken one from Grog.\nTRAVIS: In solidarity.","response":"DM: I appreciate that you brought it back."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Nothing's changed.","response":"DM: No, it's a reminder. Yay!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Sam, buddy! You made it.\nSAM: Oh my gosh. Okay, I'd like to plug a few things. No.","response":"DM: However, we do have a present for you. Because there have been periods of time in which you've complained about not having a proper stein or mug to match the rest of the group, we figure–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I've got a Google one.","response":"DM: Google one works fine. But thanks to some of our wondrous, illustrious campmates we were with at Burning Man, they gifted this unto us to gift unto you, as we felt it was fitting and size-appropriate."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, yes! Yes, it makes me look cute!\nLIAM: You have to measure that out in a regular cup first, and then pour it in.\nTRAVIS: You could pour two whole drinks in there, and it would be half an inch of liquid.\nSAM: Wow, this thing's amazing!\nMARISHA: So thanks, post-nuclear family.","response":"DM: Well done."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's a hotel ice thing.\nMARISHA: Yeah, it's technically an ice bucket.\nSAM: I want to fill it up right now.\nLAURA: It's hiding your face.\nTRAVIS: Lock it up! Jeez.\nSAM: I poured a whole glass in there and it looks like nothing!","response":"DM: You got to keep pouring. Upon hearing of the Briarwoods' arrival within a week to discuss political matters and enjoy a feast, of course the members of Vox Machina, who are part of the council in Tal'Dorei were invited. Within that week, they made their various preparations, made the various beard checks, made the various beard shavings. It happened! And made their way to the central palace at the Cloudtop District of Emon. The Briarwoods arrived, a feast was put out. However, Percy went in under an illusion to look like Vax over here, while Vax went invisible. Everyone had formal attire on, weapons left at the door, unarmored, dressed for the occasion."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is that true, no armor?","response":"DM: Yeah, you guys were all dressed in formal attire."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We don't even have any weapons.\nSAM: Do I need to subtract things from–?\nTRAVIS: The recap makes it so much better. Just lay it out.","response":"DM: So your weapons are at the door. They're not on you at the moment."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They're at the door? We left them at the door?","response":"DM: Yeah, as part of the check-in process."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Question, mine are on me, right?","response":"DM: Yeah. Because you went invisible and you were under the approval of Seeker Asum."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You just increased my chances by 2%. Thank you.\nLAURA: And Percy, your weapons are still on you because you already had an illusion on you, right?","response":"DM: Correct. The List is on him, his Pepperbox. Bad News would be a bit difficult for you to bring in here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Diplomacy would work out well, though.","response":"DM: Yeah, I think so. During the feast, conversations were had, questions were raised and information was extracted. Seeker Asum had requested to have been met in the foyer by our rogue here, who forgot and then decided to go on his own upstairs following the Briarwoods to the second floor where their guest room was set. He distracted one of the guards with his serpent belt, knocked out the other, entered the room and found himself face to face with the Briarwoods themselves."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That did not lead to further hallway, in fact that just led to a bedroom. It ended right there.","response":"DM: Yeah. It went right into their guest room. So after a brief discussion, a little bit of awkwardness, you attempted to leave, but were placed in a holding pattern by a Hold Person spell, and had the two Briarwoods come up to you, whisper in your ear that you had nothing to worry about, you look delicious."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah, there's nothing to worry about.\nLIAM: They're kind of hot.\nLAURA: Right? I mean, they are hot, right? So at least there's that.\nTRAVIS: What are we doing while this is happening?","response":"DM: You guys are just now leaving the feast hall at this period of time."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Where are we entering to?","response":"DM: A large foyer area. There's the main foyer of the palace that splits off to two smaller meeting chambers and the chamber to the right is what leads to the Grand Hall. That's where you guys were feasting. So you're making your way into this–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Hasum?","response":"DM: Asum? Seeker Asum, yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Seeker Asum. Is he around? Do we see him anywhere?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Tell me this, DM. When my Invisibility spell is broken, am I alerted? Do I know that? Do I sense it?","response":"DM: The spell itself would dissipate, as it is a concentration spell. It would be a, oh, spell's gone. However, before we get to you guys. We have more immediate business to attend to."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Let's play, Matt. Let's play.","response":"DM: Vax. Your muscles lock in place, sweat beginning to bead down the front of your forehead. The realization of the immediate danger you put yourself in washing over you. You can see across the way, in the dark candlelit area of the room by the canopy bed, is Lady Delilah Briarwood, hand still out, smiling at you. Immediately to your left shoulder is Lord Sylas Briarwood, who has leaned in. He's actually pulling you away from the door now. You're skidding across the ground (dragging sound) as he shifts you, your legs unable to actually move. As he pulls you forward, the Lord whispers in your ear, “You are a curious one, though not quite gifted with the silver tongue. Foolhardiness is not becoming of a guest of the Briarwoods.” For a moment, there's this pause, this tension, the silence, and Delilah, Lady Briarwood, puts her hand out further and says, “Yet, my love, we are not here to make enemies, nor raise suspicion. We are merely protecting ourselves from intrusion. Isn't that right?” As she looks at you, and looks immediately to your right, where you can feel the general presence of Lord Briarwood. I need you to go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw."}
{"prompt":"SAM: First roll. Not an unimportant one.\nORION: Not at all.\nSAM: First roll of the night. Could kill Liam.\nLAURA: No. That's good!\nLIAM: That's 18.\nTRAVIS: What was that? How much?\nLIAM: I'm frozen!\nLAURA: 18, he said.","response":"DM: You feel your muscles lax, and the sweat that is still brimming across your face you feel for the first time in these moments that seem to stretch on forever. You have control of your body, though you do feel the hand of Lord Briarwood right on your shoulder, who, as you become conscious of the fact that you are in control of your physical form, his voice comes very heavily, the bass kicking into your left ear. “Indeed. We do require allies. I would have you prove friendship.” And as he takes and moves the shoulder away, you find your torso moving towards him. You lock eyes with him, and he has this knowing grin, his lids taut slightly with this condescending sense of knowing. I need you to go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw. This is technically a charm effect, and you being a half-elf, you do, I believe, get advantage on those."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is a 21.","response":"DM: 21. You feel an extension of the sheer unnatural force of charisma that attempts to penetrate beyond the usual slippery mind that Vax holds to such a high esteem… However, you manage to resist it and feel it wash over you as the slight tingling vanishes and the effect has left you unaffected by whatever he was attempting to try."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ooh. What was he trying? Who knows?","response":"DM: There's a brief moment as he looks you over."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What do you need?\nMARISHA: Yes. That's so smart.","response":"DM: “There now. Be a good boy.” Looks over. I need you to make a deception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Deception check. Okay, I'm using Luck to go again.","response":"DM: Now you used a couple Luck points last time."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I used one. I did a lot last game, but we were over multiple days. I used one this day. I'm about to use my second. (gagging noise) Okay, this is deception?","response":"DM: Deception, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ooh, that's not as great. That's a 15.\nLIAM: Thank you so much. Thank you so much! What can I do to help? I'm pretty meager a servant, but anything you need, whatever you need! Gosh, you guys are good-looking.\nLIAM: It isn't that, is it?","response":"DM: You hear a throaty chuckle from Lady Briarwood across the way. (chuckles) “No, but what do you think, my love?” Lord Briarwood comes up from behind, his hands on the back of your shoulder, and says, “Like we said, you haven't the gift of the silver tongue. But I applaud your effort.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, my mom and dad said I'm a real good speaker. They paid for a tutor? To teach me how to talk. And it's worked out really well for me in my life. So if you need an ambassador, or a butler who talks? I could do that for you.","response":"DM: Lady Briarwood at this point steps a couple steps closer. She's still about 15 feet from you. He's right behind you. Right between you and the door. She steps forward and looks over at her husband again, and goes, “What do you think? Can we trust him?” And Lord Briarwood leans forward, and you can feel his chin peeking into your peripheral vision. “I'm afraid not. It seems–”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, here's the thing you need to know about Uriel. And I take a step back.","response":"DM: Into him?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No! Away.","response":"DM: He's between you and the door."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, does he hold me if I turn? Well, I just said that, right? Here's the thing about Uriel.","response":"DM: As you go to move away, his arms that are on your shoulder, tighten, flex, and hold you in place."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, you don't want to know? Okay, I'll just save that for later.\nSAM: Roll for coy.\nLIAM: Roll for what, Matt?","response":"DM: Since I don't know what you're going to say, I'm going to say persuasion for this. Because I don't know if it's a deception or not."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is the power out of the DM's hands for a moment?\nLIAM: Oh, I'm going to use my last Luck of the day!\nTRAVIS: The last one?\nLIAM: Last Luck of the day.\nLAURA: Oh my god.\nLIAM: Okay, this is persuasion? That's 17.\nTRAVIS: That was a big die.\nLIAM: You could give me a– never mind.","response":"DM: You want an inspiration?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Huh? No.\nLIAM: Yeah, no, that's why I said never mind.\nTRAVIS: Is it begging or is it praying, at this point?","response":"DM: No, I'll give inspiration when you've goddamn earned it. As you say that looking at them with this coy look of information about Uriel, they both chuckle in unison. (chuckles) “Shall we?” And she gives a nod and goes, “I think we shall.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Can I roll for initiative?","response":"DM: We're now rolling for initiative."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fuck!\nTRAVIS: Does he have an earring?\nLIAM: Yes.","response":"DM: So. Here you are, right there. Lord Briarwood is behind you. Lady Briarwood is over here by the edge of the bed. These are the two windows, this is the layout of the room here. As far as you are aware, there are two guards outside the door, currently."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: My initiative can only be described as fecal.","response":"DM: Oh no."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It wasn't a one.\nLIAM: Wasn't a one.","response":"DM: One adjacent, is what you're telling me."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Six, it was six. It comes close.\nORION: I thought you were out of there, man.\nLIAM: Should I check my iPhone, too?\nLAURA: He's pulling up his spells.\nTALIESIN: He hasn't had time to memorize all the ways he's going to fuck with you. There are that many ways.\nLIAM: 19.\nMARISHA: Sounds like Blight or something.","response":"DM: You take 21 points of necrotic damage, and she's going to go ahead and step this way. After that she backs up and grabs the edge of the post at the side of the bed and looks at you with this grin. At that point as you tense from the pain, Sylas immediately whips to one side and with an unarmed claw attack, a giant fist is going to hit you on the side of your torso. That is going to be a 21 to hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That hits.\nMARISHA: Oh ho! They're sucking the life out of you.","response":"DM: It's your turn."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He's holding me, right?","response":"DM: Actually, this will be part of his unarmed attack. No. He does not have you grappled, currently. He's over the shoulders."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. As a bonus action I'm going to use rogue's cunning action to disengage, which means nobody can swipe at me if I run, okay.\nMARISHA: (whispering) Jenga!\nLIAM: There's a window. Last week, you said there was a window to the courtyard.","response":"DM: There are two windows on each side of the room there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. I'm running straight at the window, and as I run– yeah, past them, and I don't go anywhere near her, and I'm using dash, and I'm leaping out the window and saying, \"Jenga.\"\nTRAVIS: Jenga!","response":"DM: (window breaking) As you run past, you can see there's this moment where it's almost like they are letting it happen. There is no momentary aggression or frustration to this as you dart and (crashing) out the window falling from the second story. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is a 32.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do I even stop running?","response":"DM: (chuckles) You hit the ground with a tumble, and you get up and you continue to move forward. So at this point you've pushed into the courtyard now. You can see the cobblestone road that surrounds the outskirts of the palace. There are a few bits of light and you can see there is the carriage they came in, horses still attached, and the younger man who led them inside who was driving the coach is napping on the front, who is now looking over, spooked, at the sound of shattering glass as it clatters onto the ground around you. And that ends your turn. Everyone else, you hear jenga whispered through those of you who have the earrings on."}
{"prompt":"SAM: He's in trouble! Let's go!\nMARISHA: What's going on?\nTALIESIN: Now we hear shattering glass, don't we?","response":"DM: Not from this part of the palace. You're too far away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I start running towards the door to grab weapons. And I'm saying into my ear, where are you? What's going on?\nSAM: I'm by the bartender saying, I ordered a large. Please, can I have a slightly larger one please? What? Oh! Oh shit!\nMARISHA: I'm going to go eagle, and I start scouting the halls looking for him.\nTALIESIN: I'm running with them towards the doors\nLIAM: I don't know. Am I able to talk further?","response":"DM: That's about as much as you got out this combat round because it was a very quick series. It took all your effort to even get out of that situation."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: She and I are booking it for the door.","response":"DM: So you guys go forward. You run towards the front and the weapons are being held in this storage area off to the side that is used for storing weaponry and armor for people who arrive and shouldn't be wearing them in very social events. So you guys head that way. You're getting a big drink."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm heading to wherever I saw the Briarwoods taking off whenever they were leaving.\nTALIESIN: Actually, did you turn into an eagle? Can you carry me?\nMARISHA: No, you're big. I can take the gnomes.\nTALIESIN: That's fine; I need to get my gun anyway.","response":"DM: You burst through the hall and head up the way. As you do, you can see some of the other servants glance around, suddenly."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I poop on one of them as I go over.","response":"DM: As you're gliding up the staircase and onto the second floor, there are two servants. One darts out of the way."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's one of the Briarwoods' servants, right? Oh, no. I want to save it for if I fly over one of the Briarwoods. Never mind. It's fine.","response":"DM: We'll let it go. So as you coast up, releasing your avian payload on the stairs, you can see, looking jarred and confused, a human woman, brown hair, freckles, mousy-looking servant looks up and reaches up as you spatter the side of her shoulder."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (caws) That's me saying sorry.\nORION: I see what's going on. You're flying? I cast Fly on myself. I follow suit behind her, and as I'm passing by the person she shat on, I cast Prestidigitation on her. Sorry about that!\nTALIESIN: Bad News.","response":"DM: So you go ahead and grab Bad News and pull it off the side. That's your guys' action now, so as you are out front, Lady Briarwood is going to right at the window. Looks down for a second, and I need you to make another wisdom saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's a 13.","response":"DM: 13? So as you get up and you say jenga. A familiar feel comes over you as your muscles once again lock into place and you fall over from the momentum of the run, going face-down into the cold, dew-covered grass in this courtyard area, unable to move."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (muffled) Fucking bitch!\nLAURA: I guess running towards the Briarwoods' room.","response":"DM: Where you saw them leave? You head up the stairway, following behind where you saw Keyleth and Tiberius rush off to. Are you following the rest of them?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah. I put my mug down and I start little leg waddling towards them. As I go, I'm going to send a message. I use Message to– who's the guy who likes us?\nLIAM: My name is Vax.\nSAM: No, not him. Sylas? No, not Sylas! Seeker Asum?","response":"DM: Seeker Asum, with Message? I believe the person has to be within visual range. Wait, no. You can cast through solid objects if you're familiar with the target and nobody on the barrier. It's 120 foot, though. You don't know how far he is. You could give it a shot."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, I say, something's gone awry. We may need you right away.","response":"DM: The message is delivered out into the space. Hopefully, it found its recipient."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: As I'm running towards the Briarwoods' room, I start shouting Uriel! and grab a servant and say, go find Uriel. Tell him there's enemies within the gates, in the castle. Now!","response":"DM: “Yes, Lady Vex. Right away.” Runs off. You guys coast up the stairs. Right as you reach the top of the hallway over here, you can see there are two guards that are currently standing at the door."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I stay at the front door.\nMARISHA: Is the door open?","response":"DM: The door is currently closed, but you're in eagle form, so you're going to be doing like eagles do. I'll say, you're about there because you were a little bit ahead of them. Those are the two guards right there. At this point now, as this is happening, I need you guys to go ahead and roll initiative."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's okay. Thanks, Percy. Ten.\nORION: 17.","response":"DM: And Keyleth? Keyleth, you got ten, you said?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes.","response":"DM: Okay, so after that current circumstance, that brings us– as they're rushing up, you would be finishing off the last round, so you can make another wisdom check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I failed it.\nLAURA: Seeker!\nLIAM: Nine.\nLAURA: Start rolling different dice!\nLIAM: The universe is random and doesn't care about you and me.\nMARISHA: Life lessons by Critical Role.\nSAM: Stay in school, kids.","response":"DM: You take 34 points of necrotic damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm unconscious. I haven't been knocked out in ages.","response":"DM: You go unconscious, then when it comes back to your next turn, you have to make a death saving throw. If you fail three–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right, so it's only if it exceeds my hit point maximum that I'm killed outright, so I'm unconscious.","response":"DM: You are unconscious."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hey, guys. I'm unconscious.\nMARISHA: So that means he never got his “I'm right here” message out.","response":"DM: Nope."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But we know he's in the room. That's where we're all heading.\nMARISHA: Well, he's not in the room. He's in the front yard, at this point. So we are heading to the room.\nLIAM: Wait. As that happens, and as my consciousness fades away, I don't say anything, but here's what I think in a split-second. I think of my friends that I have spent so much time with. I think of Keyleth, beautiful, walking under the trees. I think of my twin sister as a young girl, folding up linens with our mother. I think of my sister as an adolescent in lessons, smarter than me. I think of the woman she grew into. Hiking over many, many, many miles together. My best friend. My best friend, Vex'ahlia. And before I can think no more, I say a prayer to Sarenrae to watch over my friends and keep them safe.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Eight.","response":"DM: With that thought cast out, the darkness swallows your vision and unconsciousness takes you into the cold, wet grass on the floor of the courtyard surrounding the palace. A small shiver runs down your spine, Vex: a feeling you haven't felt before. A feeling of sudden and immediate sourceless dread, and in that instant you know that there is almost no time."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I use Hunter's Mark and sense where Lady Briarwood is at that moment?","response":"DM: Yeah, she is actually at this point, beyond the palace walls. You can sense and knowing the palace walls. You were expecting a second floor, it's that direction but just outside the walls of the palace. And you guys just got your weapons."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I take off running in that direction.","response":"DM: I'm going to have people who haven't rolled initiative yet, go ahead and roll initiative so I can put you on the timing chart here. Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17.","response":"DM: 17, nice."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 17.","response":"DM: 17? Look at you guys."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 16.\nLAURA: I hadn't rolled, actually, for that. I hadn't rolled initiative yet. 18.\nLAURA: Can I use my earring during that? I tell Keyleth and Tiberius that I think they are outside the palace walls.\nORION: Copy that.\nSAM: Did I hear that?","response":"DM: Do you have your ear pieces on? Then yeah, you would."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Then I don't run. I Dimension Door outside of the palace wall.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and make an intelligence check. Roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Not good. Oh, wait.\nTRAVIS: Seeing how fast she's running, I go into a rage.\nSAM: Oh, wait. It says I have advantage on intelligence saving throws. This is not a saving throw. Then no, eight.","response":"DM: Eight? So you manage to Dimension Door–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Into an outhouse!","response":"DM: As opposed to being directly outside, because you haven't seen this part of the palace, you're not really 100% visual range; you haven't visited this side. You end up trying to come over in this area. You end up appearing right up here inside the room, looking at the window and you can see down. Suddenly you look about this room. To the left of you is Seeker Asum, who doesn't even notice you are there. He is currently putting away a crossbow. Looking out the glass window, you can see down with the little bit of light that's in the courtyard. You see Lord Sylas Briarwood looming over what looks to be the currently unconscious body of Vax'ildan."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's right, it's dark outside.","response":"DM: Yes, it is. Bringing us to this point now, that's your guys' turn. Tiberius? You're up."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Does anyone have eyes on Vax? Anyone?!\nSAM: I do! Do I?\nLAURA: Yeah, you do.\nSAM: I think I do.\nORION: Where are you, Scanlan?\nSAM: Inside a room. I don't know where I am. It's a nice-looking room.\nORION: I assume you're in their chambers. I'll be right there. Fireball to those guys right there!\n(explosion sound)\nORION: I wanted to say real quick, right before that, I got to my decanter of water and I start charging it, and then I do Fireball.","response":"DM: So roll your damage on that."}
{"prompt":"ORION: How much is that?\nTALIESIN: Will that also widen up the hole into that room?\nMARISHA: We'll see, I guess.\nSAM: Or you could make a wall of fire.\nORION: How much is that? 35!","response":"DM: 35? Okay! One of them gets blasted and thrown almost off his feet and pushed back from the sheer force five foot in that direction. The one that's this side of the doorway, who was already at one hit point, barely brought from already being knocked unconscious by Vax, you hear a scream, and is turned to ash, his  charred armor left clattering across the ground."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What about the door?","response":"DM: Both doors are blown open from the force of the explosion. A large portion of the room is currently singed with black. What's your fly speed?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 30 feet.","response":"DM: That's as far as you can get."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Can that dude see me from where I am?","response":"DM: He can currently see you, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Good. I turn to him and I'm like, you better get the hell out of my way! And that's my turn.","response":"DM: Okay! Make an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM, LAURA, and TRAVIS: Yeah!\nORION: 23!","response":"DM: From what you can see, the helmet itself guards part of the face, but you can see from the charred, slightly angered, gritting expression on his mouth as he looks at you as you shout that, the grittiness goes away, the jaw opens slack, and takes two instinctual steps back into the hallway. Does not appear to be interested in threatening what just blew his friend into ashes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Cremated him!","response":"DM: From behind you, as you're flying over you see this servant come rushing up, the female one that you saw earlier on the stairway. Rushing forward, seemingly with an intense look of what went from curiosity to now engrossed in this current circumstance. Kit, do you want to go ahead and take your place?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, what's going on? What do we see?\nORION: This is where she comes in?!\nLIAM: You can sit right here!\nMARISHA: Oh, I'm really sorry I pooped on you! I didn't know I was shitting on you!\nORION: I cleaned you up. Don't worry!\nLAURA: Can I ask a question? Trinket. I didn't say I left him at home. Did he wait outside of the palace during the formal dinner?","response":"DM: Trinket would not be at the dinner, per se."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But he would have stayed outside at the palace, right?","response":"DM: Trinket would probably be kept somewhere near the stables, where the people can watch over your animals."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He eats at the table with us all the time!","response":"DM: Not in the middle of the grand hall of the palace of Tal'Dorei, sorry."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She taught him to sit in a chair.","response":"DM: As you rush in, you see this giant fireball blast through the middle of the hallway. Two of the guards are sent off to the side. There's this hurried look and this shout. You've seen these individuals throughout the palace before, and they're part of the council. You've always kept a distance from them. You're a servant of the palace; you want to keep up appearances for many reasons. However, there's this rush of energy and this general sense of dread in this corner of the palace. And for the most part, judging by this, you didn't like the Briarwoods when they arrived, and you think things are going wrong here. What are you going to do with your turn?"}
{"prompt":"KIT: Can I join in the fray?","response":"DM: You're right over here in the hallway. It's hard to see from this perspective here, but you're right over here."}
{"prompt":"KIT: Okay.","response":"DM: This is Kit Buss, who's our official artist for Critical Role."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's the United Kingdom.\nTALIESIN: Where the real accents come from!\nSAM: She's going to be doing the worst American accent possible.\nLIAM: What's going on around here?","response":"DM: You're over here. There's this guard here, and these doorways are blown open and seems to be where all the energy's going. You have a good sense for the flow of energy and emotional tension, and right now everything is pushing in that direction."}
{"prompt":"KIT: Okay, can I use my turn to dash to get through the doors?\nTALIESIN: Where am I?","response":"DM: You were rushing outside with them or rushing up the stairs?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Rushing outside with them.\nTALIESIN: Am I just there, or am I off the map?","response":"DM: You're, in theory, off the map on this side. I'll get to that shortly. You're rushing as fast as you can. You exited the front of the palace and spent your whole turn rushing as fast as you can around the side. It's a long distance, putting all your energy into it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have a very long range.","response":"DM: You have no visual, unfortunately. That brings us to Sylas."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That dick!\nLAURA: Seeker Awesome?","response":"DM: Asum! He's pretty awesome. He's going to leap down here. He's going to make his own acrobatics check, which he does with flying colors because rangers are cool like that. Lands immediately and angrily rushes forward going, “No!” and attempts to feint into an attack, and Lord Briarwood puts up his hand to attempt to deflect with preternatural speed just (whoosh) out of the way. Asum, instead, reaches down to grab the unconscious body of Vax and is going to attempt to move you away from here. Sylas does get an attack of opportunity against you. That's a 16?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do I make a death saving throw?","response":"DM: What's your armor class?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 17.","response":"DM: 17. Unconscious. I'll say there's no dex bonus to that because you can't move out of the way, so that would be 15. I'm sorry, 12. It hits you; I rolled for that. You immediately take a death saving throw. Instantaneously. You failed one. Now, it is Sylas's turn. That was Seeker Asum, now it's–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Seeker's turn and Sylas got to take a turn!","response":"DM: He got a free attack because he moved out of range to try to hit him. Rushes up to join the fray there. He's going to look towards Seeker Asum and say, “This quarrel is not with you.” Asum looks over his shoulder. Asum relaxes his grip on Vax's body and stands at attention. And you hear him say, “My apologies, I did not mean to meddle.” He seems to be stepping out of the fray."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Seeker Asum is?","response":"DM: Yes. That's a charm action to get him out of that. That will be Sylas' turn. That brings us to Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to go double my speed. My fly speed is 80 feet right now. I'm going to head towards and pick up Scanlan.","response":"DM: Make a general dexterity check. You're flying in very tight quarters as a giant eagle flowing through."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Dexterity saving throw, you said? As my eagle form, right? 12?","response":"DM: 12? Okay, that's fine. You clip a wing. It hurts, and you wince at the impact, but you manage to make your way in there. As you come down, you grab Scanlan, but there's not a lot of room here to get much lift or air, so you're now clutching your gnome."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I get a save?","response":"DM: Do you not want to be grabbed by her?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, I don't know she's there. I don't know what's grabbing me.\nMARISHA: You've seen me turn into an eagle.\nSAM: I'm not even looking at you.","response":"DM: Make an insight check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Insight check? Okay. Not good. Five.","response":"DM: Five. Okay, you see this giant eagle come screeching into the room, talons out, and starts coming at you with talons. Be mindful of that. It's technically now a grapple contest, so go ahead and make an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: An athletics check with my eagle. Is that dex or strength?","response":"DM: It would be strength."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 19.","response":"DM: 19. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check to avoid it, or athletics. Athletics or acrobatics, your choice."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 15.","response":"DM: 15. As much as you try and fight, the eagle grabs you and your tiny gnome form is grasped in its claws. Oh, woe is this evening."}
{"prompt":"SAM: First, I got a small drink, and now this?\nLIAM: I succeeded.","response":"DM: Okay, so you stabilize."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wait, I'm at one?","response":"DM: You didn't die. Sorry. My apologies. Vex, you swing around the corner, just getting to the outskirts."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right as I get outside– I would whistle, but Vex can whistle, and she whistles for Trinket.","response":"DM: You're not sure where Trinket is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, but I whistle for him. He knows to listen for it.","response":"DM: Do you want to get as close as possible to the fray?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: I'd say as you turn the corner, that will get you about there, and you can see now, there is Seeker Asum and Lord Briarwood both standing over what looks to be a small cluster of cloth, the source of the dread."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I scream. Can I attack?","response":"DM: You can, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, if I did something that did five feet– ten feet… I've got to look at this. Yeah, ten feet. If I hit Lady Briarwood, would that hit my brother, or would that just hit Bastard Briarwood?","response":"DM: No, that would just hit her. Oh, within ten feet? It would hit Seeker and Sylas, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fuck it, I'm doing it. Lightning Arrow right at her face.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it. Roll for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Don't miss.\nLAURA: Well, that's wedged.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, it's a weirdo roll.\nLAURA: Natural 20!","response":"DM: The fury pumps through your veins in an attempt at vengeance at what appears to be your twin brother at death's door. You pull the arrow from the back of your quiver. As you feel the energy gather from the atmosphere around you, while the energy itself is a blue crackling energy, you see it as bright, vibrant crimson red. You release it with a scream towards Lady Briarwood. Go ahead and roll damage on that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What do I do, times two?","response":"DM: Yes, times two."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So it was 32 damage on her, and then everybody within ten feet has to make a dex save.\nLAURA: Not him. He's not in it. And I Hunter's Marked her.","response":"DM: Right, so it does additional damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fuck. One.","response":"DM: One. Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Every little bit counts.","response":"DM: The lightning hits her. It shocks her, and you see the pain come through, but for the sheer force that should have been, it seems almost like it wasn't as impactful as it should have been. However, Lord Briarwood and Seeker Asum both fail, so they both take the additional damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, good. Then 2d8 for them. Nine, and then times two because it was critical? 18.","response":"DM: Sure. I'll allow it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Haggling.\nLAURA: And I get another attack, though. Yes? Okay, then I'm going to attack her through my Blazing Bowstring. Natural 20 again!\nLAURA: Inspired by my brother!\nLIAM: She loves me.","response":"DM: Against Lady Briarwood to follow up on that?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, of course it is! Okay, eight plus seven is 15 plus two for bracers, so that's 17 times two is 34.\nSAM: Hunter's Mark.\nLAURA: Plus Hunter's Mark damage, which is another fucking six! 38 damage. No! No, it is 40 damage.","response":"DM: Well, no, she's not concentrating because he's unconscious. I was saving for the Hold Person spell, but she's not concentrating on that, currently."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: She's on fire!","response":"DM: She is actually lit on fire."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I should say what the Blazing Bowstring does, huh? An additional d10 of damage for that. Would that have been part of the part that was multiplied by two?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Another six for that.\nLIAM: Does Seeker Asum get a save now that he's been hit, to shake that charm?\nKIT: At least you messed up her dress.\nLAURA: Yeah, fuck that dress!","response":"DM: As the electrical energy and the flames dissipate, she puts her hands out like this, and she looks at you for a second and she extends one cruel finger towards you with a look of intense hatred. I need you to make a constitution save."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: I don't know if she has to aim it or not. Let me check. Nope! I need you to make a constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Yeah. Okay, cool. 15. No, wait. 17.","response":"DM: 17. That's not enough, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh man. That's a lot of rolling.\nLIAM: Carry the three…\nSAM: I'm going first. Fucking shit. I know she's got me in her fucking claws.","response":"DM: You've figured this out now, after this whole (yelps). Keyleth, of course."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I still see through the window?","response":"DM: You can see through the window right there, yeah. It's hard, at this point."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 30 feet.","response":"DM: He is not close enough to reach. You'll have to move first."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Then maybe you don't want to go first.\nMARISHA: I can take you over there.\nSAM: Would I know that?","response":"DM: You would know the range of it. You'd be like, “Ugh, he's too far.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You can move first, can't you?\nSAM: I can't move. She's holding me.\nLAURA: You can wait.\nMARISHA: I'm trying to give you a fast way down, motherfucker.\nSAM: I know. I guess I'll hold my turn.\nORION: Okay. Move me an additional 30 feet because my flight is 60 feet, so that was from the last turn.","response":"DM: Okay, 60 feet flying speed. Good to know."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Let's swoop in that room. Another 60 feet. How far can I go? Can I go all the way down?","response":"DM: That's as far as you can get, right there."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Crap, balls. Can I see anything? I can't see anything. Outside?","response":"DM: That's the 60 feet for your movement."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm still flying, so can I see?","response":"DM: Right, from an elevated standpoint, you would probably just barely be able to see the edge of Lord Briarwood down there, below. He would have three-quarters cover, but you can see him."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I can't see Vax?","response":"DM: No. Not from the angle of the window."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I charge my decanter. That's my turn.\nORION: Oh shit. Yeah. Can I do that?","response":"DM: Or you could go outside, if you wanted to."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Then I can't do anything else after that, right?","response":"DM: This would be the end of your turn, regardless."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, then get me right where I can see Vax.","response":"DM: Right there?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Actually, skootch me one over. I can still see him from right there, yeah?","response":"DM: Yeah, you can see him there. Cool, so you're floating in the air, currently, looking through the cracked window at the cluster of mayhem that's below. That ends Tiberius's turn. Grog."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Raging, I see Vex take off so fast. I try and catch up to her and see what's freaking her out so much. My speed is 50.\nSAM: Wait, no. Healing Word has a 60 feet range. You said 30!\nTRAVIS: You're after me. It's okay.","response":"DM: It's all happening simultaneously."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I take the Firebrand Warhammer with the Chain of Returning attached to it. I activate it, and I throw it at Lady Delilah.","response":"DM: Okay. What's the range on it?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It doesn't have a distance. It has a DC to pull it back.","response":"DM: Here's what we'll do. It's the warhammer or war pick?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, the warhammer, but the Chain of Returning doesn't have a distance.","response":"DM: I know. It's the distance of the weapon, is what it is."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay.","response":"DM: Looking it up right now for you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What did we do before iPhones?\nTRAVIS: How is it 150/120?\nLAURA: Yeah, because you used it when we were fighting that manta ray.","response":"DM: I don't have a Player's Handbook. If somebody could look up the equipment section right now?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What are you looking for?","response":"DM: Excuse the sound change here, as I have to move the mic. There we go. I got it. There is a range on thrown weapons, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Does it count as a mace? Handaxe?","response":"DM: Warhammer… this one is not considered an actual normally thrown weapon, so I would give it the same distance of a handaxe, which is 60-foot max, but you would be at disadvantage on the throw, anyway. Pretty heavy disadvantage on this, so we'll give it a shot."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That doesn't even make 60 feet, though, does it?","response":"DM: No. As you lob–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: If I know how long it is, can I do something else instead of throwing it? If I'd known the distance–","response":"DM: Yeah, if you know the distance, then I'll say sure."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I try for Intimidating Presence?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: There's a DC saving throw–","response":"DM: Against her?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay. She glances over at you as you come running around the corner, this giant engine of muscle and death. You growl at her, screaming–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (roars) No!","response":"DM: What's the DC on it?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 13.","response":"DM: 13. She glances over at you and you see her head turn to the side with a curious chuckle."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So low! God!","response":"DM: Yeah. Sorry."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Bring it back to Sam.\nSAM: Will 60 feet hit him?","response":"DM: Yes, it would."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I feel like I'm going insane!\nSAM: Even though that's a bonus action, I'm going to do it as a 5th-level spell.","response":"DM: It's an additional 1d4 for each, so it would be 5d4 plus five."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And I roll it?","response":"DM: Yes, you do."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Well, then give me a bunch of d4s.","response":"DM: Kit, you're on deck, so imagine what you're going to do next."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I need one more. Great. Okay. Whoa, what the hell is that one? Ah, shit! What are these? I can never add d4.\nORION: 12. Plus?","response":"DM: Five. So you heal 17 hit points. From the darkness–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, is it plus five, or is it plus five, five, five–","response":"DM: No, it's plus five. Consciousness comes to you. Breath comes into your chest, and you can feel the cold, wet grass against the left side of your face. Your vision begins to clarify for a second, and you look up over you. You can see immediately to the right of you both Lord and Lady Briarwood standing over you, looking down with one half of their gaze, the other paying attention to–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: They're looking at me?","response":"DM: They're looking down at you and glancing at this slowly encroaching circle of assailants. That was your bonus action."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, it's 19.","response":"DM: With that. Okay, good to know. What are you suggesting to her?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm suggesting that she has an unquenchable urge to make out with her husband.\nSAM: It is wisdom.\nLIAM: She doesn't feel even a little bit horny?","response":"DM: You gather that probably at all given points of time, she probably enjoys being close to her husband, but not overcome with an uncontrollable urge."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She has a headache.\nKIT: Okay. Am I within 120 feet of either of the Briarwoods?","response":"DM: You are, but they're not currently in visual range because they're outside and down below, so if you want to try and move over this way, you can try to get a visual."}
{"prompt":"KIT: Am I able to move somewhere where I can see them?","response":"DM: You would have to leap up onto the edge of the canopy bed. You can just see them past the broken window, down into the courtyard there, as Tiberius, the dragonborn you saw coast through, is hovering in the air about five feet above you."}
{"prompt":"KIT: I would like to – oh, there's lots of excitement going on, isn't there? I would like to use Crown of Madness, if I may.\nSAM: Wait! I thought she was just a common guard!\nLAURA: Servant.\nKIT: I would like to use Crown of Madness on Lord Briarwood.\nKIT: My DC would be eight plus my spellcasting modifier–","response":"DM: It should be at the very top of your spell sheet."}
{"prompt":"KIT: Okay. 17.\nLAURA: Yay!\nTALIESIN: Oh my god, is something actually going to work?","response":"DM: He is going to use his legendary resistance to succeed the saving throw. So as you do that, you see the magical energy form around his head and this crown of darkened arcane energy forms and begins to clasp around, and he looks up for a second and shrugs his hair like that, and it (crash) dissipates, and you can see for a brief second his vision come up and find your gaze."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But Matt, she's our guest!","response":"DM: I understand! As it was a concentration spell, also, the illusion that you currently were holding fades away. What was once the demure, mousy-looking human guest suddenly appears as a pale, white tiefling, currently now existing at the edge of the bed. Her image shimmers and disappears as you see her standing before you on her hoofed legs, holding what was previously a non-visible staff in one hand."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I'm right above her?","response":"DM: You are right above her, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I go, ooh! Nice horns!\nLAURA: Our friend is in mortal danger right now, you maybe wouldn't want to hit on somebody, at that moment.\nKIT: I would have to agree.","response":"DM: Percy. Following suit, you begin to move around the corner to the others. You are now within visual range of both Briarwoods– at a far distance, though– too far for the Pepperbox. No, its range is 150, so yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Pepperbox range is 150, but the Bad News range is disgusting.","response":"DM: Nah, they're within range for both."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So I'll start with Bad News.\nMARISHA: Nothing travels faster.","response":"DM: Against who?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (yelling) Sylas!\nTRAVIS: Yes. I got little goosebumps from that.\nTALIESIN: That's a 30 to hit.","response":"DM: Yeah, that'll hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Rock. His. Shit.\nTALIESIN: (sighs) This is about to feel so good.\nTRAVIS: De-cleat this motherfucker.\nMARISHA: These are the worst people we've ever faced.\nTALIESIN: I hate them, I hate them so much. Where's my other d12s?\nMARISHA: d12s? 12, 12 away.\nTALIESIN: That's 17 points of damage.","response":"DM: Okay. The first shot. As you (gunshot), the shot echoing out across the night sky of Emon, Lord Briarwood, who is currently staring down at you as you come to consciousness, and you can see under his breath, he says, “Oh, there's no way out tonight, friend.” And begins to lean forward before (impact) the back of his shoulder is wracked by a sudden impact. You see dark material just (spray) spatter out with some sort of dark crimson, and he (grunts). Looks over his shoulder with anger, and you can see at that point, glistening across the moonlight, the sharpened fangs visible at the edge of his mouth. As he looks over–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is he looking at me? Okay, good, I'm taking another aimed shot at his face.","response":"DM: Okay, so you use your second attack to reload."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Third shot, aimed shot at the face, while he was turning around.\nLIAM: As he reloaded, weakly, behind him, I go, hi, Percy.\nTALIESIN: That's 24 to hit.","response":"DM: 24 to hit will hit."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Skadoosh!\nMARISHA: Yes!","response":"DM: Okay. That was using the arm shot? Good. So as he turns around and glares at you, there's like a moment of clarity, and you can feel that familiar stare, that horrible glare, and the cowardice in you fights the moment of tension that you've been waiting for this sequence. As you load the weapon, he says it loudly enough for you to hear, but this voice now, you see Lord Briarwood says, “Would you look at that, dear? The pup yet lives.” (chuckles, gunshot)"}
{"prompt":"KIT: No mercy Percy!\nTALIESIN: Is that as far as I can make it?\nTRAVIS: Misses.","response":"DM: Yeah. Goes and for the bonus action reloads and gets the second shot at you. That will be a 19."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hits.\nMARISHA: Wait, I didn't get my turn?","response":"DM: Keyleth, you're up after him."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I have a question. At some point I'm in the mix?","response":"DM: Yeah, you're coming up. Don't worry. You guys rolled the lowest initiatives."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, he's prone, still.","response":"DM: He's still prone, yeah. So Sylas is going to, seeing the circumstance, reach down and attempt to grab you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Get out of there.\nLIAM: To do what? To grapple check? Do I have to roll, too?","response":"DM: To attempt to grapple you, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I roll, as well.","response":"DM: You don't have to."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, fuck that guy.\nLIAM: For hitting?\nSAM: As I see this going on, can I call out with Cutting Words to distract him?","response":"DM: You could, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What do I roll?","response":"DM: d10. And subtract that from his attack modifier."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Six.","response":"DM: Okay. With that, as he reaches down in an attempt to grapple you and grab you by the throat, the fingers are coming towards you and you try and attempt to roll out of the way. All of sudden, you hear, “Distraction!” and Lord Briarwood's, (annoyed sigh). You see his massive eyeroll and then goes in for the attack, but that's given you enough time to roll out of the way his hand only meets the ground. He's then going to step back and get adjacent to Lady Briarwood. That ends his turn. Keyleth, you're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to fly out the window with Scanlan.","response":"DM: Out the broken one over here or the non-broken one?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The broken one.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What are you doing to me?","response":"DM: So you're coasting over here."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and drop him off.","response":"DM: Okay, so as you swoop down and leave Scanlan right there in front of them, that'll be there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So Seeker Asum, he's against us?","response":"DM: You have no idea, you just swooped out there and he's there like hiding in the shadow."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But he just fired at Grog.","response":"DM: You didn't see it, though, from your perspective there. You just saw a bolt go."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I didn't see that. Do I still have enough movement to make an action?","response":"DM: Yeah you do, yes, that was just your movement as you swooped down."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Where's Lord Briarwood?","response":"DM: Right there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to go and try and peck his eyes out.\nSAM: Are you dropping me?\nMARISHA: Yeah, I dropped you off, I'm going to go and swoop over–","response":"DM: Okay. You've already used your movement to get there and drop him off and go all the way around."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's what I was asking.","response":"DM: Yeah, you used your full movement to get there and drop off Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you still want to be an eagle?\nLIAM: Yeah, because it's a hit point sponge.\nMARISHA: Yeah, you know what, I'll drop eagle form.","response":"DM: Okay. Keyleth, all of a sudden the eagle condenses down and forms back into Keyleth in her half-elven form."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I will also use my bonus action to cast Healing Word on Vax.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I will also cast it at– actually, I'll cast it at a 3rd level because I want to be safe.\nSAM: Here are some d4s.\nMARISHA: Thank you.\nLAURA: She cast it at Vax.\nSAM: So you need one more, right? At level three?\nMARISHA: Oh, and it's plus my spell modifier? Is that what it is? Plus ten, so yeah, I need one more, so that's 17 points.","response":"DM: 17 points of healing."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hers is different.\nMARISHA: Oh no, wait. No, 15. Sorry.\nSAM: You're back.\nLAURA: You're back, baby.","response":"DM: And with that, Vax."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You have to tell me what's possible. I'm prone, right?","response":"DM: You are prone on the ground."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is what I'd like to do. You tell me if it's possible. I'd like to click my boots of haste together and then get up, which takes my full movement? What does it take?","response":"DM: Half your movement."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Half my movement. This is what I want to do, you tell me if it's possible. Click my boots of haste, get up, use disengage again, and then run like a motherfuck straight towards–","response":"DM: Yeah, you could probably do that, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do it!\nLIAM: That's what I want to do.\nSAM: Straight towards what?\nLIAM: My sister. And as I run past, I share a very awkward glance with Keyleth and keep going and just run and lock eyes with my sister and run at her.","response":"DM: Okay, and what's your full movement then? It would be 30 times two, which would be 60, half that, so you can run 30 feet because it takes half your movement to get up. So yeah, you disengage. There you go."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: There you go.\nLAURA: Dimension Door!\nTRAVIS: Kill some people?\nLAURA: Okay, yeah, I'm going to take a healing potion. A superior, which is what?","response":"DM: Superior would be 8d4 plus eight."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's so many fours.\nTRAVIS: It's not like you don't have 30 dice anyway. So many dice.\nMARISHA: These fuckers, I'm so angry at them.\nLAURA: 20. Oh, 28. That's good. And then I'm going to cast– I'm sorry, Hunter's Mark. I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns right at the one in the middle. They're right next to each other, right?","response":"DM: Yeah. You would be scooting right over Scanlan's head with your arrow."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Let's stick it to Lady Briarwood again. Cool. Balls. Oh wait, do I, I don't need to roll to hit on that, right?","response":"DM: It would say on the spell."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh wait, that's wrong. Oh, the next time I hit a creature. Oh, so I don't think I hit her. That was 15.","response":"DM: 15 would not hit, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, then I try it again. I didn't hit her again! It's because you're safe now, buddy.","response":"DM: So as she stands there grinning, looking over all this, they're both amused by this whole circumstance, there isn't really a glimmer of fear. As the first arrow comes by, she leans to the side, just dodges it a little bit. The second one comes towards her, and Lord Briarwood deflects it out from in front of her and gives you a look of like, don't you dare touch my woman."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where's Trinket?","response":"DM: Trinket is somewhere."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, did he hear? I whistle again.","response":"DM: You whistle again, okay. That's your turn."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm Tiberius Stormwind!","response":"DM: “Yes, indeed you are.” As she looks at you for a second, and there's this sparkle, this prismatic glow of light in her eyes. I need you–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 4th-level Counterspell. Were you saying something?","response":"DM: Hold on."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Dice versus dice. Wizard versus wizard.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll a d20, add five."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Seven.","response":"DM: Yeah, that's not going to do it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But that's a lucky number.","response":"DM: At that point, all of a sudden, you feel a surge of arcane energy suddenly burst, not visually, but on this coursing connection, almost like two nexus points of energy. There's this tidal wave of arcane energy that blasts into your mind. I need you to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Are they Superman and Wonder Woman? What the heck?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nORION: 18.","response":"DM: 18? 18 would unfortunately not succeed. Yeah, you take 21 points of psychic damage–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: (yelps)","response":"DM: And your intelligence and charisma scores become one."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What?","response":"DM: Suddenly, language leaves you. All the spells, the nature of spellcasting, is robbed, and you know where you are, but everything is instinctual. From this point, you are essentially, from a communication standpoint, a giant lizard."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (lizard noises) Am I still flying? I'm assuming I fall.","response":"DM: At this point, actually, yeah, you do, because you can only maintain concentration. And you land on the ground. She then steps–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wait! Is it permanent?","response":"DM: You don't know."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can fix it. It's okay; don't worry about it right now. I can't fix it right now!","response":"DM: Tiberius. It's your turn."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What the fuck can I do? Is there a saving throw?\nSAM: There is no save.","response":"DM: At the end of every 30 days."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 30 days?! He doesn't even know what a day is!\nMARISHA: I can fix it. I can fix it after I sleep. Just not right now!","response":"DM: Which is what she would be saying if she was knowing this was happening to you. So anyway. You still know your friends. You know you have friends here. You know there's something to protect. You know that people need protection. You must protect! And that's the extent of where your drive is right now."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, I guess– and I'm confused as hell, I assume?","response":"DM: It's hard to say. You're still you, you're still present there, you just know that suddenly, “Spells? I don't know spells. (growls) Anger. Frustration. Protect.” It's all base instincts right now."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Does he know friend from foe?","response":"DM: You don't know."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I mean, I'm not going to do shit. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to leave. I'm going to go out the door and back in the hallway. And I'm going to whip around to that guy and go, (aggressive lizard noises).","response":"DM: And he goes, (scared noises)."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Because I know I don't like him.","response":"DM: Right. And takes another five foot step back from you. Unexpected feral reaction from Tiberius!"}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I'm going to dash.","response":"DM: Yeah, I moved you double. Okay, that ends your turn? Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Me? I would like to run towards the fucking Lord Sylas. Can I reach him?","response":"DM: You can't get all the way there, but you can get within throwing range."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Throwing range only? Yeah, I'm going to throw the hammer again.\nTRAVIS: 23.","response":"DM: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17.\nTRAVIS: Oh, yeah, sorry, d6 of flame damage! Shit. One.\nTRAVIS: I succeed.","response":"DM: You pull in the chain. It whips back. Like Thor, you catch it mid-air, prepare yourself for the next round. That'll be your turn. Scanlan?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh. Hi.","response":"DM: You're now there, face to face. You are essentially the shield of the group between the Briarwoods."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh. Hello. What a lovely dinner we had– Lightning!\nSAM: Wait, she rolled a one?","response":"DM: She rolled a one to try and counter your spell."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Please make it funny.\nSAM: Oh, so wait, I get to roll for damage now? It's a bunch of d6s right? 8d6.","response":"DM: 8d6. And for their saving throws–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I arc it so it hits both of them?","response":"DM: Yeah, it would hit them both."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Would it also hit Mr. Awesome?","response":"DM: No, he's off to the left."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.\nLAURA: Of course they do. Hate them!\nSAM: 32?","response":"DM: 32, okay. That's a 16 to Sylas and eight to Lady Delilah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wow, she can take half of half?","response":"DM: Apparently."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Magic resistance.","response":"DM: Both of them (impact sounds) take the blast from the– and you see this look of: okay, things are getting a little weird now. They both look at each other with a realizing they're now a front of two against many swarming individuals. Do you want to move or stay where you are?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I will move backwards. By a lot. And have I seen the tiefling?","response":"DM: You have not. Oh no, you did. You flew past as you went and you were like: what the heck is that? And then you pulled out."}
{"prompt":"SAM: But I don't have eyes on her? So I can't inspire her?","response":"DM: Unfortunately, no."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thanks. I get a d10 right? Ha! Okay.\nKIT: Okay, I'm starting to get a bit pissed now. My tail is whipping, and I would like to use Phantasmal Killer.\nMARISHA: What is that?!\nKIT: To Lord Briarwood. Again.\nMARISHA: That sounds awesome.\nSAM: Her accent is so fake.\nKIT: (exaggerated American accent) I know, right?","response":"DM: So are you staying at the edge of the bed, or are you going towards the window to have a clear view?"}
{"prompt":"KIT: I'll move forward a bit.\nLAURA: Wait, how many times does he get that damn thing?\nTRAVIS: He's like a dragon!\nKIT: It's fine, I'll wear him out.","response":"DM: Remember, the target still becomes frightened for the duration. So now, as you do this and look up, Lord Briarwood has had this cocky grin the whole time, sees this sudden albino tiefling in the window glare down and send this shimmering wave of arcane energy hissing from above. The echo of the hiss hits Lord Briarwood and for the first time, you see him recoil in strange momentary terror and seems to almost step back into the side of his wife. Glances over his shoulder towards her and she gives him a look of misunderstanding and acknowledgement. So he cannot get near you, currently. Cannot get any closer to you and has disadvantage against anything against you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Just her or us?","response":"DM: Just her."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Clap hands.\nMARISHA: Percy!\nTALIESIN: I'm going to take a standard walking speed 30 feet straight ahead. Swinging Bad News back onto my back, pulling out Pepperbox. Sylas! I'm getting his attention again. I'm going to start shooting with–\nSAM: Are you still in disguise?\nTALIESIN: No, I don't think anymore.","response":"DM: No, the moment you fired, the illusion dissipated."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah. So I'm going to be using my sharpshooter for this.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 26 to hit.","response":"DM: Yeah, that hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So that's, let's see. Oh, I need one of these, too. That's 22 points of damage and one point of fire damage.\nTALIESIN: Same thing again.","response":"DM: So you've shot, reload, shot. And this turn–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, I put Bad News away. Bad News is empty.","response":"DM: Oh, so Bad News is empty. That's the first shot. You got this. Cool. Sorry, I misunderstood."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ain't going to be a dick about it.\nTALIESIN: 25?","response":"DM: 25 hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 21 points of damage.\nTALIESIN: Shooting again.\nTALIESIN: 18.\nMARISHA: Sylas?\nLAURA: Did someone ever get Uriel?\nTRAVIS: Hits.\nTRAVIS: Do I have advantage on those if I'm raging?","response":"DM: No, you just have a high constitution."}
{"prompt":"SAM: He still has disadvantage on attacks, right? That wore off?\nTRAVIS: 18.\nTRAVIS: Hits.\nTRAVIS: Damn it. Ha! Even better. 21.","response":"DM: Yeah, once again. There's some sort of enchantment that's trying to pull from the wounds as it hits you and you just grin them off with this chuckle. So he's going to use the rest of his movement to step back a little bit. You get an attack of opportunity."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I do?","response":"DM: Yes, you do. With the hammer."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes! That's 24.","response":"DM: 24 hits. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Awesome. That's 11, plus four points of fire damage, so 15.","response":"DM: Okay, 15. Cool. That ends his turn. Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: My turn? Okay. Wait, where did Briarwood go? Lord Briarwood.\nTALIESIN and MATT: Right there.\nMARISHA: Oh, he backed up. Beautiful. So I take my staff and I crack it on the ground. Where I cracked it, little ice crystals start forming against the ground and start making ice and I'm going to cast Sleet Storm. I need a thing.\nSAM: I have a 20. What do you want?\nMARISHA: No I need a–\nSAM: What do you need?\nMARISHA: A laser pointer! There you go. So it's a 40-foot radius. Starting where Briarwood is.\nMARISHA: Right. Starting in this line. Grog's not in it.","response":"DM: This way, you mean?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: From here back.","response":"DM: So Sleet Storm (boom) right in that area right there. So as you slam the ground, the ice begins to move around and all of a sudden the cold air begins to form this almost like mist as the temperature shift suddenly impacts the surrounding vicinity. The grass freezes in place, and you can see bits of ice and sleet begin to rain down in the vicinity."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So the ground in the area is difficult terrain. It is covered with slick ice. When a creature enters the spell's area for a first time or on its turn starts its turn there, it must make a dexterity saving throw or else it's knocked prone, because they slip and fall. If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area the creature must make a successful concentration saving throw against your spell's DC or lose concentration.","response":"DM: Good to know."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And you have inspiration.\nMARISHA: And then I move back.","response":"DM: That ends your turn. Vax."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, I'm going to throw one dagger at Briarwood's face.\nLIAM: That's a one. If I'm hasted, can I do two potions? Instead of attack, attack, attack.","response":"DM: No. The additional action is not so much a potion."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes. Knowing that they seem to be vampires because they've fucking creepy teeth, I'm going to pull out one of my holy arrows and shoot it at– Lord Briarwood's in the way of Lady Briarwood now, isn't he?","response":"DM: You can try and shoot either if you want to move over to the side and get a better view."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on him.","response":"DM: On him? Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And then I'm going to shoot my holy arrow through my Blazing Bowstring one more time.","response":"DM: Okay go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Come on! Hold on! 28.","response":"DM: 28 does hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, good. Do I do any additional damage with my holy arrow?","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll damage for the arrow. And you do an additional 2d6 radiant damage to Lord Briarwood."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh wait. 15, 19. Plus ten for the Blazing Bowstring, so 22, and then what did you say?","response":"DM: 2d6 radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Seven more, so 29 damage.","response":"DM: Okay, good to know. So as the arrow impacts, (impact sound) he puts up his cloak to guard in time, as it goes (whooshing) through the cloak, you hear this (grunts) in pain as the arrow bursts, and as the cloak comes back, you can see this burning sensation across the front of Lord Briarwood. Where the flesh was healing and sewing itself up, that has been halted immediately by the impact of the holy water, which is beginning to pockmark and burn his flesh."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay that's a 29 to hit.","response":"DM: That'll hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. That's good. Plus two radiant damage.","response":"DM: That's your second holy arrow, right?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: What was it before that?\nLAURA: 17. 28. And then another d6 for my Hunter's Mark. 32!\nLAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: Lady Delilah Briarwood steps forward up to the back of her husband."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: She's got to make a dex throw.","response":"DM: She does. And against the spell, 'cause it's magic, she gets advantage. That would be an 18. What's the DC?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It just says they just have to make a dexterity saving throw or they're knocked prone.","response":"DM: Right, but it's against your DC of your spell."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, is it? 18.","response":"DM: So yeah, she makes it. So she steps forward; almost slips, but catches herself on the shoulder of her husband and says, “My dear, I fear it's time that we make our leave.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Make our leave?\nMARISHA: No, they're going to bamf!","response":"DM: Casts Dimension Door. Both of them (whoosh) out of visible range."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait! I turn to Vex. Vex, does your Hunter's Mark tell you where they went? They just disappeared. Where'd they go?\nLAURA: They fucking disappeared?\nTALIESIN and MARISHA: They Dimension Doored out.\nLAURA: I do have Hunter's Mark on him.","response":"DM: On him, yes. You sense that they're not that far from you. They're around the corner where you guys came from."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They're right there! Do we want to keep fighting them?\nLIAM: He's ragged! Go! If we're ever going to get them, we need to get them now! Lead the way, Percival!\nLAURA: They're around the corner.\nMARISHA: I can probably teleport us through a tree, right?\nSAM: That's okay, we'll just run.\nLAURA: They're right there.","response":"DM: As you guys rush around the corner you can see on the very edge of the cobblestone walkway, the carriage that they came in is now gaining speed–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Sharpshoot right now. I'm going to try and take out a wheel.\nTRAVIS: (yelling) Close the gates!\nTALIESIN: 27.","response":"DM: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Nice.\nTALIESIN: 20 points of damage.\nMARISHA: How, roughly, far away are they?","response":"DM: Right now, they're about a hundred feet–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is Trinket anywhere near them?","response":"DM: Trinket was over at the stables on the far back of the palace, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I still have my Sleet Storm up. It's a concentration spell. I'm going to move it over there.","response":"DM: Can you just shift it over there?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah. It's a concentration spell. It lasts a minute.","response":"DM: Oh well no, it's concentration to keep it in the area."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well, then I cast it again.","response":"DM: So you're casting Sleet Storm again. What's the range on it?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 150 feet.","response":"DM: 150 feet. The sleet storm lands down. The cobblestone becomes sleek; the carriage begins rocking back and forth. However, it does manage to keep on its course, currently; it does not get knocked prone. It's hard to knock a carriage prone, but it is sliding out of the way."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is that a disadvantage because it only has three wheels?","response":"DM: Good call, actually."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And it's rough terrain?","response":"DM: That is a two."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Where is it?","response":"DM: From a visual standpoint, you're about 60 to 70 feet from the front of this. The doors slam open and you can see Lord and Lady Briarwood step out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I shoot my exploding arrow?","response":"DM: Hold on. As you've guys are just turning the corner. You can see now Lord Briarwood stands up and is trying to compose himself, ruffles himself up angrily, looking at his damaged circumstance. Lady Briarwood's against his shoulder and she goes, (clicks tongue) “Well, (sighs) at the very least, I think you should come visit us sometime, Percy. You're always welcome back home. It'd be nice of you to visit your family once in a while.” Roll initiative. Just you. As you were the first action to take."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 19.","response":"DM: 19? Go ahead and roll. Roll the attack for the exploding arrow. This is against Lady Briarwood?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 29. It's against her.","response":"DM: Yeah, 29'll hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What do I do damage for the exploding arrow? That Percy made, by the way.","response":"DM: Yeah. Roll for your–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 16.\nLAURA: Okay I'm rolling one of our Critical Role dice.","response":"DM: So half damage to both of them."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Trademark!\nLAURA: Damn it.\nSAM: Critical fail!\nLAURA: 11.\nTALIESIN: I want to walk over to the carriage driver.","response":"DM: You walk over to the carriage driver, who is currently on the ground, this young man who's horribly hurt, part of his torso is burned, and he's like, (coughs, grunts). Trying to climb away. (gasping) “Please, please spare my life, please. What do you want from me?” (labored breathing)"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What do you know?","response":"DM: “About what?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I shoot him in the right hand.","response":"DM: (gunshot, screams) It's an easy enough hit, he's prone before you. Three of his fingers are blown off, and the bloody stumps. (gasps, grunts) Shaking. (panting) “I'm sorry. I don't– look– ”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You're from Whitestone, yes?","response":"DM: “I am. You don't know what it's like. I had no choice.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well, you do now. I reload again and put it on his left hand.","response":"DM: “Please don't, please.” The rest of you are gathered, and you step out from the edge of the window and make your way with the rest of the crowd, and they're watching this display on the front of the palace."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Frederick de Rolo.","response":"DM: “Yes?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Where is he?","response":"DM: “He's gone. He's gone, sir. I'm sorry.”"}

{"prompt":"(yelling)\nLIAM: Wow.\nLAURA: You're not dead!\nKIT: Yay!\nTALIESIN: Thank you for not dying!\nLAURA: Hopefully, you won't turn into a vampire. You did get bit.\nORION: I think that works, is like, if it goes all the way down to zero–","response":"DM: Welcome back, guys. Couple of quick things before we jump into this. One, we are 38 subs from our next giveaway. Giveaway is for those who are active in chat, get a signed photo of the cast of Critical Role, as well as a signed piece of art, wonderful piece of art from our Kit Buss who's right here with us."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Have you guys seen them? They're awesome.","response":"DM: It's pretty awesome, it's a wonderful piece of art of Keyleth transforming into an earth elemental and attacking K'Varn in the K'Varn fight. So yeah, we have that coming up. Also we have the winner of our shirt giveaway tonight. The winner is one Blair Beverage!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Real talk, the winner here tonight is me.","response":"DM: I was so scared."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You win another day.\nMARISHA: It's been one of the most emotional nights of my life.","response":"DM: So. As you all begin to gather around on the front of the courtyard of the palace, you can see some of the guards start rushing out amongst the splinters of this carriage that has been royally destroyed by many of you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Do I see that everybody's safe?","response":"DM: Yeah, you get the sense that there is no immediate danger."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay. I'm going to use my lizard-brain and sniff out immediately Allura, and I'm going to go find her.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do we see him go find her?","response":"DM: You guys currently are too engrossed with Percy currently pinning a young boy on the ground and shooting his hand off."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: He's currently like, “Please. What do you need? Just let me go. Please.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I want you to spend the rest of your life making up for the things you've allowed to happen. I now take the butt of my gun and I'm going to knock him unconscious.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I don't quite know. I'm just rolling, but I'd normally get 21.","response":"DM: 21, at the point of life he has left (whack). Yeah, he just (impact) falls and crumples to the ground unconscious, pool of blood forming."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Are there soldiers coming?","response":"DM: There are guards coming now from the palace."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Put him in a cell.\nMARISHA: Wait, we can put him in our cell.\nLAURA: Yeah, put him in our cell.\nMARISHA: We'll bring him to Greyskull Keep.\nLAURA: But make sure he doesn't bleed out first.\nMARISHA: He's fine. He's not bleeding. It was non-lethal damage, right; he's not bleeding out.","response":"DM: Well, not from the head but he is missing three fingers from one hand and is currently pooling."}
{"prompt":"KIT: I have been working here for months. You did not notice?","response":"DM: “I think we would notice a tiefling in our midst. You're under arrest. Throw her in the cell.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I walk forward and slap my hand on the guard's arm and say, we saved Uriel, you will stand down now. Uriel would not be alive if not for the people around you now. She's fine. Walk away.","response":"DM: The guard gives you a look and says, “As far as we know right now, you both, all of you, attacked two of our guests in the center of our own palace. They managed to flee. We're going to investigate this. Currently we're holding no one at immediate prison sentence for this, but–”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You realize your lord would not be alive now were it not for us, don't you?\nMARISHA: Also, you're a common guard. I'm speaking because Tiberius would say this, and he's not here right now because he's a little stupid at the moment, but do not interfere with the businesses that we have already arranged with people who have higher authority than you. Back off.","response":"DM: Make an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I'm not good at this shit. I'm going to train in it. It's coming.","response":"DM: You do get a d6 inspiration dice."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I also still have Scanlan's.","response":"DM: Well, if you already have Scanlan's, then that's all you need."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And I walk over and stand behind her.\nMARISHA: I'm going to add my Scanlan. 15.\nLAURA: What's up? What's good?","response":"DM: He relinquishes the hand on the side of the tiefling and says, “We're going to investigate this. I mean no disrespect to you. You've been much aid to Emon. Just understand, this is a very peculiar circumstance. Please, we'll call you when it's time to get your opinions and your perspectives on the evening's events.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, we'll call you.","response":"DM: “We need to go ahead and notify–” at this point you can see now, Tiberius, you've stepped up in front of the stairs as Allura comes rushing out to inspect everything and sees you."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (groaning, fumbling) And I go to Lockheed, and I use my telepathic bond that I have with my pet. And I convey to him, to tell her, I emote to him, with my telepathic link with him, and I (foreign words).","response":"DM: You can't even form language thoughts."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's what I emote to him.","response":"DM: You can give him an emotion. That's the most you can get to him right now"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Right, and I try to have him telepathically tell her.","response":"DM: Tell her what emotion?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Help.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I do this.","response":"DM: She steps forward and says, “Tiberius–”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The universal symbol for I'm choking.\nORION: (frustrated noises)\nLAURA: Vampires!\nSAM: And a tiefling.\nTALIESIN: I want to inspect the carriage to see if there's anything interesting about the carriage.\nLAURA: Are you hurt? Did they do anything to you? You were unconscious.\nLIAM: They bit me.\nLAURA: I search him and look for any mark.\nLIAM: I don't feel right. I think I need to go to a temple.\nMARISHA: Can I do a health check on him?","response":"DM: You can make a medicine check, sure. Percy, go ahead and roll an investigation check"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I think I'm dangerous.\nMARISHA: 18.","response":"DM: Okay, yeah, there are definitely two puncture wounds on the side of his neck"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You need to put me in the dungeon very soon.\nSAM: I've read about this. We bury him under the ground for five days and five nights, all will be better.\nORION: That's kimchi.\nSAM: Well, it could be. Could be kimchi. Either way, it will be very tasty.\nTALIESIN: Eight.","response":"DM: Most everything that would be of interest has been destroyed in the sheer force of the explosion. The carriage is in tatters. There's not much you can really glean from it, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What time of day is it?","response":"DM: Time of night. Right now, it's probably cresting close to 10:00 or 11:00PM."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Would the Sarenrae temple still be open? It's a church. They're 24 hours, right?\nLAURA: I turn and look. You.\nSAM: What's your name?\nLAURA: You helped us.\nSAM: Your real name.\nKIT: You have interesting taste in enemies, almost as interesting as mine. My name is Lillith.\nMARISHA: Lillith? That's so pretty.\nKIT: Thank you, as are you also, might I add.\nLAURA: Interesting taste in enemies. Do you know anything about vampires?\nKIT: Regrettably, not as much as I would like. But your brother? He does look, not as healthy as I imagine he may usually.\nSAM: Are you a healer of some sort?\nKIT: I am not.\nTRAVIS: Oh, what do you deal in?\nSAM: And why did you infiltrate the castle? That's how the British people say it\nKIT: Oh, really? Well.\nSAM: Aluminium.\nLAURA: Laboratory.\nORION: Astronaut.\nMARISHA: Let's just keep listing words, guys.\nKIT: Lift.\nMARISHA: Lift!\nKIT: I think you have currently more pressing matters than my concerns, my presence here in the castle.\nLAURA: Then you'll come with us?\nKIT: If that is what you wish.\nLAURA: Yes.\nMARISHA: Where are you from? Your accent's so–\nLAURA: It's wonderfully interesting Keyleth, but we need to get my brother to a cleric.\nMARISHA: Oh, right, yeah.","response":"DM: At this point, as you guys are discussing, and you're already nervous that you're out in the open anyway. You're not under one of your various guises. You feel this warm bolt of heat in your upper torso area. And you guys watch as suddenly across the front of her chest, this strange, glowing, red eye-like sigil (flame noises) emblazons across the front and then slowly fades."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I am just looking at the symbol, I am not looking at anything else.\nLAURA: What was that?\nKIT: No, but I must leave. I must leave this place right now. Immediately. I drop a shroud of illusion over myself again, become the maidservant.","response":"DM: You guys watch her visual image shimmer back into that of a servant. And even through the illusion there is still this dull, pulsating red, glowing arcane mark of an eye, that's slowly shimmering on the front of her torso."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can you come with us to a temple?\nKIT: For not long. I cannot linger.\nSAM: What is that mark on you?\nKIT: This is the mark of the Broker.\nSAM: The Broker?\nKIT: The Broker. He has been seeking me and I have been hiding here, but no longer. He has found me. This mark, it means that I cannot hide any longer. I must leave.\nSAM: You helped us in battle. Do you need us to help hide you?\nKIT: I would not drag you into my troubles. I know who you are, you are Vox Machina.\nLAURA: How did you know about us?\nKIT: Some of you traveled with my cousin Zahra.\n(gasps)\nLAURA: Oh my gosh, Zahra! She's so wonderful. I love her so much!\nKIT: We are very close. She is a dear friend of mine, but she told me of you. I know you have your own troubles. I would not drag you into mine.\nMARISHA: Well look, we've got to make a pit stop at the temple of Sarenrae, anyway. Why don't you at least join us, and then we can at least go back to Greyskull keep for dinner, because we also have to drag this prisoner back there. It's along the way.\nLAURA: Yes. Any watcher that comes after you we'll fight them. We're very strong right now and full of health.\nTRAVIS: And we protect things with tails.","response":"DM: A voice rings out suddenly from behind you towards the palace. “All of you, stop your business.” And you look and you see there in his robes, Uriel, which you summoned, standing at the front of the palace. “Am I to understand there has been a scuffle with my guests?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Your guests are vampires. Look at my brother right now.\nMARISHA: And Tiberius is–\nSAM: An idiot.\nMARISHA: He's an idiot. I don't know where he's an idiot right now. Damn it, we lost Tiberius.\nSAM: He's even more of an idiot.\nLIAM: (calling out) Tiberius!","response":"DM: You see now on the front steps sitting there next to Allura, who's cradling him, as he's unsure of what is happening."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, do we see them?","response":"DM: You do, yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Look at his neck.","response":"DM: Uriel looks and says, “I'm certain there is some sort of explanation for this.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You invited vampires into your palace.\nMARISHA: You invited them in.","response":"DM: “We will investigate. Look, the Briarwoods are esteemed guests of ours, and friends. So this is going to be taken very seriously.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You can have whatever mages you want cast truth on me. I was bitten. This threat is real.\nTALIESIN: The Briarwoods murdered the de Rolos and took Whitestone. I have proof. I was there.","response":"DM: “Then we shall have to have a conversation. For the time being, take care of this one. Tomorrow, when the sun rises, find yourself back to the palace. I would very much like to speak with you. This disturbs me.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I would recommend, Uriel, dis-inviting them for now.\nLIAM: We have earned your trust, have we not?","response":"DM: “You have. As have they.”"}
{"prompt":"KIT: If I may, my lord. I was present for– please excuse me addressing your grace, but I was present for the battle, and I did see, oh! Quite a set of teeth he had. Oh, dreadful pale. And oh, terrible. Oh, flames everywhere and ripped dresses and heaving bosoms. Oh my lord! It was awful!\nSAM: She's a common servant girl. She wouldn't lie!\nMARISHA: Yes. Look, she is traumatized.\nKIT: 18?","response":"DM: “Very well, calm yourself, calm yourself.”"}
{"prompt":"KIT: Oh! It were awful!\nSAM: We'll take care of her for now.\nKIT: Oh, I'm getting the vapors! Oh no.","response":"DM: “Take care of her. We'll talk tomorrow. Bring me what proof you have. This is a very, very serious thing you're discussing.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We'll talk to him in the morning. We got to go.","response":"DM: You guys gather up–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I turn into a horse and pick up Vax and Vex and take them to Sarenrae's temple.","response":"DM: Okay, you guys leap onto the back of Keyleth as she rides off."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I hold onto your mighty mane, and then him as well.","response":"DM: Allura takes Tiberius, takes you by the elbow, and leads you over the rest of the group as they ride off. “If you are, indeed, going to a cleric, perhaps you should take Tiberius with you. \"He's not well.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: He seems totally normal to me. Seems like every day. Yep, that's pretty much basic him.\nTRAVIS: Is Seeker Asum still around?","response":"DM: Seeker Asum currently is nowhere near this situation."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I lick all of Vox Machina.\nTRAVIS: Oh jeez, no!\nORION: I lick Grog the most.\nTRAVIS: Smells like flies.","response":"DM: You all manage to make you way up to the temple of Sarenrae. The lantern light of the interior of the temple's main structure is low, as it is late in the evening. Nevertheless, the gates are always open. And as you enter, you are greeted by two clerics that are dressed in long, flowing yellow and gold robes, and there is one elderly cleric that you recall. The one that led the resurrection ritual on Pike. Not but almost a year ago actually."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I hop down off of Keyleth.\nLAURA: I take you down, as well. And I say, please, please sir, I hope we're not disturbing you, but we need your help again.\nLIAM: I totally eat it and just hit the ground.\nTRAVIS: That wasn't my fault.","response":"DM: The two younger clerics step away as the older one steps forward. He's balding on top, this long straggly white gray hair that crests–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I go up to him and start sniffing him. (sniffing noises)\nMARISHA: He used to be a very intelligent sorcerer. This is part of the problem.","response":"DM: “There does appear to be arcane residue on this one. Yes, we could hope to cleanse him of this. Come, enter. Light the lanterns.” And the clerics all start turning up various lanterns, and the magical light source of it as soon as you enter the temple. A cold ripple sensation begins to curl on the back of your neck as you step in. As you do step in, too, the two clerics give you a look, and are uncomfortable with the presence. And as it has, you guys, through your travels, you have encountered very few tieflings, let alone on this continent. In fact, most you have met were in Vasselheim. This one in Emon stands out like a sore thumb and everyone seems to be just a little put off by her presence."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I thought she was disguised.","response":"DM: That's right. Never mind, I retract that entire sequence."}
{"prompt":"KIT: He's still looking nervous.","response":"DM: As she comes out of this feverish daydream, none of that happened."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm so glad that didn't happen.\nLAURA: We'll pay whatever cost you need.\nSAM: No, we should haggle, don't you think?\nLAURA: No.\nORION: I lick the cleric.","response":"DM: (chuckles) The cleric: “Oh no, that– that's, that's very–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: How much will it take to save our friends?\nLAURA: Sir, anything.","response":"DM: He says: “For this one, we require a donation to the temple of Sarenrae of a hundred gold pieces.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, done.","response":"DM: He steps forward, and touches the side of your head on your temple and begins to focus. The symbol of Sarenrae begins to glow on the front of his clavicle. And suddenly, you can see these strange, gray veins that had wrapped around the sides of Tiberius's head retract, dissipate then fade, as intelligence swells back into your brain. And for the first time in at least the past half an hour or so, you are back to being Tiberius Stormwind."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (licking sounds)\nSAM: Well, that's uncalled for.\nMARISHA: Could there be side effects or something?\nORION: No, I just wanted to really do that. That was really inconvenient. Let's help Vax.\nSAM: Oh. You're with us again.\nORION: Yes.\nSAM: Oh, well, welcome back. How was it, being dumb?\nORION: I was quite frightened, most of the time. I didn't know what was going on. I couldn't cast spells and I was– Let's help Vax.\nLIAM: You didn't shit yourself, so you're a winner.\nORION: That's good, yes. You shit yourself, Vax? I cast Prestidigitation on his butt.\nLIAM: What the– Oh.\nLAURA: You're clean; don't worry.","response":"DM: Okay. As you bring Vax forward, the cleric leans forward. “What is wrong with this one?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He was bitten by something quite unholy.","response":"DM: “Oh. The good news is, if you're standing here, then most of the danger is gone. However, there might be some residual of the infection.” He leans forward and inspects it for a second, reaches into his pouch and pulls out some herbs and presses them into it. It burns a little bit."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ooh, do I recognize what herbs he's using?","response":"DM: Make a nature check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Nature check?\nLIAM: Is it sticky?\nMARISHA: 19, so 29.","response":"DM: This is glissfoil. Glissfoil is used by many medicinal practitioners as a means of burning away infections and cleansing wounds."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: He didn't even look down. He just said it.\nLIAM: Who didn't know that here, honestly.\nLAURA: They drank his blood.","response":"DM: “Vampirism.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: “From what I know of vampirism, it requires many tastes of your life force and bringing you to the threshold of death and beyond to truly turn you.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Listen, doc, I can't bite anybody here. Are you sure?","response":"DM: “Unless this is some unnatural thing beyond classic vampirism, you should be fine.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What do you mean, unnatural?\nLAURA: Well, any vampirism is a little unnatural.\nMARISHA: Excuse me? Do you actually have any extra of that glissfoil or any seeds that I could take with me? That way I can just keep up on his daily disinfection.","response":"DM: “Certainly.” He reaches into a pouch and pulls out a handful of glissfoil. It's like a dried yellowish green leaf that curls in itself a little bit and gives it to you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thank you so much.\nORION: As it happens, I reach for my decanter and I can control the charge; it's just charged, but I dissipate the charge. But also keep it for a little bit? No, I dissipate the whole thing. And I turn to the cleric and I go, oh holy man which cured my mind, would you be so graceful as to use the force of Sarenrae to bless the water in my canteen?\nSAM: To what the water?\nORION: To bless it. I'm going to hold it up above my head way too dramatically.","response":"DM: “There are rituals, but they take some time. If you'd like to leave it here, we could make use of this and bless the contents of it, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, I thought you could like do a Hosannah and get me out of here.","response":"DM: “Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. But should you require such blessing, we would be happy to oblige.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wonderful! How many days, give or take, do you think it might take to accomplish?","response":"DM: “For that amount there? Two days.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh wonderful! We'll be here for two days, guys?\nLIAM: Probably will.\nORION: I'll leave it with you.","response":"DM: “For this volume–” He looks at it for a second and says, “This is an enchanted vial, is it not?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes! Good eye!","response":"DM: “I'm curious to see how this will interact with the enchantment. We'll try. We'll put it at a 25 gold donation for the two days of enchantment.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I give you 50.","response":"DM: “Thank you.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Thank you for your service. The other 25 is for my brain.","response":"DM: “Well, is there anything else I can do to help you this evening?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thank you for all your assistance. Did he tell us a price for fixing Vax?","response":"DM: “That was a simple disinfection. There's no price for that. We're happy to heal here.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Thank you so much.\nSAM: Our friend Pike would be much, much grateful for your service.","response":"DM: “Pike Trickfoot?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes, do you remember her?\nLAURA: She's in Vasselheim, restoring another temple of Sarenrae at this moment.\nLIAM: Spreading the good word.","response":"DM: This deep smile brings his face from this deep melancholy tentativeness to this warmth you hadn't seen before, and he goes, “I had not known that our lady had reach as far as Vasselheim.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh dear.","response":"DM: “It appears you've messed yourself.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sorry! Is that blessed holy water? I'm sorry. I'll pay for that.","response":"DM: “I'm happy to hear that she has continued carrying her faith to distant lands, and that she has recovered well since our last meeting.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: She has.\nLIAM: She's thriving.","response":"DM: “Good.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: And one more thing before we leave. If you need any items, be they gear or blades, go to Gilmore's! Gilmore's Glorious Goods! Today!\nORION: You don't have to sell it–\nSAM: We're supposed to plug him, right? I don't know.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That was a little ham-fisted, but he does speak the truth. Gilmore makes a quality item.\nSAM: 25.\nLIAM: That was very awkward, Scanlan, but it's true.","response":"DM: He goes “Gilmore? I think I've seen that shop around.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They're opening a shop in here– just kidding. There's a shop here!\nSAM: There is a shop here!","response":"DM: “Me and the clerics might have to go see it, then.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Tell them Vox Machina sent you!\nSAM: And you get ten percent off.\nLIAM: If you say Vax'ildan sent you, you might get 15.","response":"DM: “Good to know. Appreciate that. Nevertheless, sleep calls to me. I must get back to–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sleep calls to us as well, sir.","response":"DM: “Well, good night and adieu to you all.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Thank you for opening your doors.\nSAM: Hey, oh, what was your name? For the next time we have a dead ally.","response":"DM: “Tristan.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Cleric Tristan? Thank you, Cleric Tristan.","response":"DM: “Of course.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Blessed be Sarenrae's name.\nORION: And I awkwardly bow out and say: See you in two days, oh mighty brain fixer.","response":"DM: He steps back. The lights dim on the inside of the temple as you exit. You guys step out into the cold night air on the streets of Emon."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (yelling) I'm alive!\nLAURA: That's loud. That hurt.\nTRAVIS: Sorry, headphones.\nLIAM: I am sorry to everyone watching at home for blowing out the mic, but gods damn it, I'm alive.\nSAM: That was close.\nMARISHA: Yeah, actually, while we walk back to Greyskull, what happened?\nLIAM: I thought that I could get a peeky-poo at what they actually were, who they were, and let's face it, I fucked up is what I did. And Grog? You may shave off my pubic region, or draw a dick on my head, if you want, tomorrow. Vex'ahlia, I'm sorry for not staying close by. Scanlan, we're good.\nSAM: I saved your life.\nLIAM: Tiberius, you are smart and I am very stupid. You are extremely handsome and I am ugly.\nORION: I don't disagree with any of that.\nMARISHA: It would have been true 30 minutes ago.\nLIAM: And I'm sorry. And Percy, I'm especially sorry. To you most of all. We weren't ready, you weren't ready.\nTALIESIN: We haven't failed. It's not over yet. I'm not done.\nLAURA: We'll hunt them down.\nMARISHA: They said your family was still there.\nTALIESIN: They're liars. My family is dead.\nSAM: We'll track them down, we'll find them, we'll kill them, and seek revenge.\nORION: And then we'll loot their bodies.\nTALIESIN: I don't think we'll have to.\nSAM: You don't think we'll have to?\nTALIESIN: I think they're going to find us.\nSAM: They won't attack us! We're many, and they're few.\nTRAVIS: That we know of.\nORION: Just because we're in a keep does not mean we are safe.\nLAURA: We need to set alarms around our keep.\nSAM: We also need to protect our new friend, Lillith fair, over here.\nLIAM: Is that your last name?\nSAM: Well, she's white, so I thought maybe–\nKIT: My family name is Daturai.\nMARISHA: How do you spell that?\nKIT: (chuckles) In your tongue? D-A-T-U-R-A-I.\nLIAM: I lost track after the D.\nKIT: You have had a rough evening, it's understandable.\nLAURA: I hope you've learned your lesson.\nLIAM: It'll be two weeks, at least, before I do anything–\nLAURA: Quite so stupid and reckless–\nMARISHA: We had a code word.\nORION: We had Jumanji!\nLAURA: Jenga.\nORION: Oh, sorry. Damn it!\nLAURA: Where's Trinket?","response":"DM: You look back at this point and you see, as you guys are reaching the outer wall of Emon, (galloping noise) behind you. (happy bear noises) Rubs up against you. (moans)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Your uncle almost died! I almost died. Did you know I almost died, darling?","response":"DM: Licks the side of your face."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I lean in, and I lick his nose with my own tongue. And then I let him lick me all over the place.","response":"DM: (sloppy bear noises)"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Vax.\nLIAM: Yeah?\nTALIESIN: Thank you. Thank you for your risk. Yes, you were foolish, but thank you.\nTRAVIS: I walk up to Vax and I extend my hand, and I say, I'm glad you didn't die.\nLIAM: I love you, Grog. Would you like to draw balls on my forehead?\nTRAVIS: And I reach back, and I backhand him as hard as I can.","response":"DM: Roll an attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I don't move at all. I just take it.\nTRAVIS: 22.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll a d4, divided by two."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's a six.\nTRAVIS: No, it's two.","response":"DM: Two plus your strength modifier, which I believe is four. So you take six points of backhand, bludgeoning damage as Grog (whacking). The echo from the impact."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And I say, no one kills you but me.\nLAURA: You deserved that.\nLIAM: Yeah.\nORION: Let's all get some rest, shall we?\nSAM: Yes, but we'll have to prepare ourselves for an attack or perhaps stalk them and kill them?\nTALIESIN: Well, we're going to find out in a minute.\nMARISHA: And don't we have a prisoner?\nLAURA: Yes.\nSAM: And we have a guest.\nMARISHA: Yes, and we still haven't found what the Broker– who he is, or what he is.\nSAM: Do you need to run from the Broker, or can you stay with us for a few days?\nORION: Do you owe some money? I don't understand.\nKIT: How well guarded against scrying is your keep?\nSAM: Not at all.\nLIAM: What about your room, Tiberius?\nORION: Yes.\nLAURA: You're guarded against scrying in your room?\nORION: Guards against scrying? Yes, of course!\nSAM: Is that true?\nLAURA: Against scrying.\nMARISHA: I'm pretty sure we would have to have an enchantment on our keep that would guard against scrying.","response":"DM: As you guys are having this discussion, a voice rings out behind you and says, “Don't worry. It's not going to help you.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is that little shitty Mr. Missing One Hand?","response":"DM: No. You turn around and look, and you can see a gentleman standing there about 25 feet away from you. You see dark brown and black studded leather armor with a cloak over one shoulder. Standing straight, with a grin. Deep dark red skin, burning yellow eyes and jet black, slicked hair between two horns that jut back. A tiefling stands there, looking forward, with two individuals flanking from side to side that are slowly stepping–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I don't know what they do, but I'm raising my arm up. Who goes there? Who are you? I've had a really bad day.","response":"DM: The tiefling, the male tiefling, steps up forward and says, “I've no quarrel with any of you. We've been scouring this city for a fugitive for a number of weeks. And as luck would have it, you guys happened to smoke her out of her hole.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I go ahead and crack my staff on the ground and cast Anti-life Shell.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And are they at the door?","response":"DM: You guys are walking from the outside of the wall to your keep."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Where are they?","response":"DM: Right now? They are coming from Emon. You guys are in this in-between section between your keep–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're outdoors? We've left the temple?","response":"DM: You are, yes. And we're going to go ahead and have you guys roll initiative."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Get close to me!","response":"DM: Keyleth started this."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Get close– what? Did I? But that's a spell I cast on myself.","response":"DM: Right. Casting spells, generally, for most people is a bad idea."}
{"prompt":"KIT: Natural 20!\nORION: Yo, Stoneskin's up, dude. I didn't get to say that shit.","response":"DM: Stoneskin's up on you, Anti-life Shell. Who is where?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Tibs and I are in the front, right? Because we both took aggressive postures.\nMARISHA: The closer to me you are, the more you'll be guarded by the shell.\nTRAVIS: Who said I want to be guarded?\nMARISHA: You can still fight around it. They just can't get in.\nTALIESIN: And we have a prisoner.","response":"DM: The prisoner was brought to your keep by the guards."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: As close to the enemy as possible. Tiberius and I took the aggressive stance.\nLAURA: Oh no, why is there more than one person?\nTRAVIS: He said two people are flanking him.\nLAURA: 20.\nKIT: 21.\nORION: And 20.\nSAM: 19.","response":"DM: 19, nice. Grog, what did you get?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 18.","response":"DM: 18."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: My magic, man.","response":"DM: 15 to ten?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 13.","response":"DM: 13."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 11.\nTALIESIN: 12.","response":"DM: What'd you say, Keyleth, you got 11?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 11. Bringing up the rears.\nMARISHA: Anyone within ten feet of me. A decent amount right now. Not Tiberius, not Scanlan.\nLAURA: Not Trinket.","response":"DM: Not technically Grog, because Grog would be up front right there. So a ten-foot radius around you. And what does it do, Anti-life Shell?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's awesome.","response":"DM: The top of the round, the Broker goes. Rolled a very high initiative. High dex character."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That is the Broker.","response":"DM: Yep. “Sweet Lillith, you've been a very bad girl. Nefertiri, Nethspira, and Bellenore would all like to have a word with you. They've paid quite a bit of sum, and proven legally: you need to be taken back. Now, to your friends here, it's your choice: the easy way, or the hard way.”"}
{"prompt":"KIT: I use Minor Illusion, one of my cantrips, and I puff up like a cloud of nightmare, and I glow, and my eyes come alight. My tail whips, my fangs get longer. Oh, I bet you did. I bet they paid you so much. You tell my sister, I hope her face still festers.","response":"DM: “Choice is made.” And with that, (whoosh) he vanishes from sight."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ooh!","response":"DM: That ends his turn."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Wait, is he casting that? Did he cast Vanish?","response":"DM: There was a casting, yes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sweet. Counterspell.\nORION: 4th-level, too.\nMARISHA: Do you mean 6th-level?\nORION: No.","response":"DM: It's a spell."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (humming) What is this? What?","response":"DM: Oh no, it just fails. You don't have to roll for this one, this is Invisibility. So as he goes to vanish, you “Oh!” as a reaction, pull out your Counterspell, and his image shimmers, and then returns. “Oh, that's not even fair.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I haven't gotten to do much today. And you won't, either.\nKIT: Okay. I would like to…\nLIAM: Buy a vowel.\nSAM: Come on, Kit Buss! Come on, fuck him up! Kit Buss!\nKIT: Can I use Phantasmal Killer again, please?\nKIT: Against the Broker.\nKIT: 17.\nLAURA: 4d10? Holy shit! Do you need extra ones? Here's a gold one for you.\nKIT: Thank you! Oh wow, I have so many pretty dice right now! It's lovely. Ooh, yeah! Ooh, so 29.\nLIAM: Little bit of Kit.\nKIT: I'll stay where I am.\nLAURA: I want to tell Trinket to cannonball over the two lined up right there!\nLAURA: Eat it! Go, Trinket!","response":"DM: He is knocked prone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good job, buddy! Little buddy!","response":"DM: That's Trinket's attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Then I get a move, still. I mean, I get an action. I'm going attack him! I'm going to attack the Broker!","response":"DM: For how that works for you and your bear, because that's his attack this turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I mean, yes. I'm assuming that's his attack, or was that his move?","response":"DM: Well, that's his attack. It's been a while since you attacked with Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I get to have Trinket attack, and then I get to attack.","response":"DM: Once, right."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait, attack action plus Trinket attack. It says one attack for me and two attacks for Trinket.\nLIAM: Trinket gets two attacks.","response":"DM: You can make one attack yourself while commanding it, so you get one weapon attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I think you should erase that and write seven.","response":"DM: As Trinket goes by, since it didn't hit him, he gets an attack of opportunity on Trinket. Does hit. Trinket does take seven points of slashing damage from the Broker as he misses him and he hits as he goes by."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, and then I'm going to shoot an arrow. Okay. That would be 26.\nLAURA: 14. I'm going to assume– I mean, it's probably way too far, but I want to keep my Hunter's Mark on Lord Briarwood for the time being. So I'm not going to break that, even though he's probably far away, so it's just 14 damage to the Broker.\nORION: Okay. Can I see the Broker where I am at now?","response":"DM: Grog's in the way. You can barely see."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Don't hit Trinket!","response":"DM: Right there it would hit both of them and not hit Trinket."}
{"prompt":"ORION: There it is.","response":"DM: Okay, so they both have disadvantage on their saving throws?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's what heighten spell does.","response":"DM: Okay, cool. As you arc around the side, you release the one single beam of flashing red energy, sparks at the end of the finger, lobs forward. (explosion) With a gargantuan explosion, red flames swirl into the area, sending the whole area, the dark part of the night, open field alight. You see all the green, dried grass is immediately burnt to a black crisp. Go ahead and roll damage. What's the DC?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 17.","response":"DM: Yeah, they both fail with disadvantage. Full damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: All the dice!\nORION: All of them.\nORION: And then I'm going to spend one sorcery point to empower the spell. And then I'm going to use the six and I'm going to choose one, two, three, and four, and five, and six to re-roll.\nLIAM: Think of how handy that would've been against the Briarwoods.\nORION: Four, five, six. Okay, I'm going to roll these.\nSAM: Much better.\nLAURA: That's amazing.","response":"DM: You can only use one metamagic option on a spell when you cast it."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Empower spell is the only one that doubles with any other metamagic. I can do it.","response":"DM: Oh interesting. Good to know. Thank you for the heads up. That's cool. I like that."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 38. 41.\nORION: 46.","response":"DM: 46."}
{"prompt":"ORION: (spellcasting sound effect)","response":"DM: As the explosion bursts forth, the flames dissipate. You can see the Broker there looking angry, frightened. Immediately takes some of the flame…"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I make it. But it's fire?","response":"DM: It is fire damage."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Good, instead of missing it I'm going to (swoosh, gulps) swallow it. (grunts) That's 20. My dex save was 20. Sorry.","response":"DM: Oh, okay, good thank you for the heads up on that."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You swallowed it?","response":"DM: So you take half damage. The angry tiefling hits you with a Hellish Rebuke."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Blowing smoke through my nose (snorts).","response":"DM: It would be seven damage. You take half damage from fire, so that would be four fire damage as you take the Hellish Rebuke's burst of flaming, dark, arcane energy and (gulps) swallow it and take it in. You blow it out the side of your nostrils. And it burns, but damn does it look cool."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And that's my turn.","response":"DM: Scanlan, you're up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Me? Shit. Is that the old lady over there?","response":"DM: Over here on this side, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, I'll take a step towards her and I will try– it's never worked for me, it probably won't work. I'll try Eyebite on her.\nLIAM: This is the time. Right here, right now.\nSAM: What do I roll? I'm doing it through my Horn of Clarity or whatever.\nSAM: 19.","response":"DM: Okay. So no, that does not make it. So what're you choosing?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's awesome.\nLIAM: “I didn't watch Matlock–”\nSAM: And then I'll just inspire our new tiefling friend with a little sexy dance.\nKIT: Is he always like this?\nLAURA: Yes, he is. Don't you feel so inspired?\nKIT: Oh, you have no idea.\nKIT: Oh, how special.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I get like behind her so I can– I need the laser pointer.\nTALIESIN: You want to get right there, right?\nTRAVIS: Yes. Yeah, on the opposite side of her from where I am.\nSAM: She's asleep. What are you going to do?\nLIAM: Kill that motherfucker!","response":"DM: You can get there."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's what I'd like to do.\nMARISHA: She will wake up. Unless you cleave her in half, she will wake up.\nLAURA: It's Grog. He doesn't give a shit about that.\nTRAVIS: I take out the Javelin of Lightning. I whisper the command word, which is Penelope, and I throw it in a straight line, which will hit all three of them, in a five-foot-wide line that extends 120 feet.\nLAURA: You're so smart, Grog!\nTALIESIN: You just did math!\nLAURA: Look at you! When it comes to battle, he knows things.\nTRAVIS: The guy that's standing.\nLAURA: Yeah, the Broker. Get the Broker.","response":"DM: So you pull it out and as you throw it downward. The javelin goes from a metallic blade into a bolt of arcing electric energy that slams downward. Penelope does not– not Penelope. You keep shouting it at me. The old woman on the ground gets no saving throw because she's unconscious and she takes double damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Double damage?","response":"DM: So 4d6."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 4d6. 14.\nLIAM: Killed that old woman so good.\nTRAVIS: And if he makes a saving throw of a DC 13, it's halved.","response":"DM: The javelin arcs through and goes towards there, and then he does make his dexterity saving throw against that. He's a pretty dexterous guy."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It takes a little shock, though.","response":"DM: Right, so it takes a little bit of damage which was, what was it you rolled, was it a 14? So it takes seven points of lightning damage for that, and then make a ranged attack on the actual javelin."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What does that do? I don't even have that on here. I have no idea.","response":"DM: Oh, sorry. That was against the target, so since he was the target, he takes the impact. The lightning bolt arcs through the old woman. She (screams) shakes awake, screaming as the bolt arcs upward from the ground, and right before it goes toward the Broker, as he rears back in fear, it solidifies into the javelin as it once again slams into the front of his torso. He's like, (grunting, gasping). He pulls it out. Shakes it for a second, looking at it, confused."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I look at Tiberius and I go, I did magic!\nORION: It was very impressive. Good job, Grog!\nTRAVIS: Thank you! Penelope.\nORION: That's my mother's name.\nLAURA: Oh no, he got up.","response":"DM: The guy gets up and only has a half move."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can he get that close?","response":"DM: On half movement, yeah. Runs up to you. As he does so you can see, holding on his side, gets up and goes bolting towards you, arcing around the side."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He runs, he runs smack-dab into my wall. My arcane–","response":"DM: Anti-life Shell. The Anti-life Shell does–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Blocks living things. They can't come in.\nORION: Unless you invite them.\nMARISHA: Like vampires.","response":"DM: It was a ten-foot radius you said?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Vax'ildan flips him the double birds as he hits the wall.\nLAURA: From inside the wall.","response":"DM: So he's unable to, just runs forward, hits the barrier, skids past, hold his place there instead then."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's unfortunate!","response":"DM: However, has a spear."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh shit.","response":"DM: Still rushes around with it, both hands on it, arcing towards you with it. That is going to be–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Can I use Uncanny Dodge with it? Or is it too late?\nLIAM: For ten points of damage. And then I'll throw my Dagger of Venom at him, see what happens. Oh, the same hit, same amount. The last one hit. This one hits. That is three, six, nine. Plus, he has to make a saving throw against a DC 15 for poison.","response":"DM: Constitution. He is going to fail that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, go fuck yourself. That's not the right die is what that is. Let's see, poison damage is– that's not great. Ten. Ten points of poison. You are awesome! (whooshing)\nSAM: Wait, what if Lillith is the bad guy instead of the good guy?\nLIAM: Kit Buss is not a bad guy!\nLIAM: Where I am. I'll stay where I am\nTALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to walk to the very edge of the spell right here, so I'm standing one closer to our friend there. Not just to you. I want to be close to the big strong schmuck.","response":"DM: Okay, so right there?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is the Broker holding anything? Is he, is he using a weapon?","response":"DM: The Broker you see has like a shortsword out. He's currently tossing it and catching it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Just a shortsword?","response":"DM: Or he's tossing it and catching it but like (grunts). He's having a bad day. The Broker was not prepared for Vox Machina."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. Before I start to do anything I'm going to look at him, look him in the eye: What is wrong with you? Don't you see there is nothing here for you? Run away before you die! There is no option! And I'm just going to start unloading. Natural 20!\n(yelling)\nLIAM: Damn, son!\nTALIESIN: Pepperbox.\nMARISHA: What is wrong with you?\nLIAM: Percival de something something something de Rolo the III, you badass motherfucker!\nTALIESIN: That's 16 points of damage.","response":"DM: That's to the Broker?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: To the Broker. I'm just shooting at the Broker.","response":"DM: 16 points? That is doubling the dice?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That is doubling both of the dice. Now a sharpshooter shot.","response":"DM: The Broker can't do anything. It already used its reaction."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shot misses. And another shot, seven, 19?","response":"DM: 19 hits."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Three more? That seems terribly unfair.\nTALIESIN: That's 25… that's ten points of damage, plus four points of fire damage. Sharpshooter shot. That's a 22. That's 21 points of damage. Another  Sharpshooter shot with ice fire. Finally, I get the breakdown on that one. The gun jammed. I put it away.\nMARISHA: But that was awesome. That was pretty dope.\nTALIESIN: How many fired shots did I get? Was that five shots or six shots?","response":"DM: That, that was five shots. Well, all in all, it was six shots, but five hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Did you see the nostril? His little nostril twitch.","response":"DM: I feel bad for him."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to do something weird here and I'm going to hold you onto this. I'm going to get a little weird, and I'm taking straight chest shots and I'm just firing chest shots, and I'm just making a hole the size of a baseball in his chest. And as it happens, as I keep unloading, the gun still breaks and I'm still pulling the trigger.","response":"DM: (booming, gasping, coughing)"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (yelling) You fool, your soul is forfeit! Die! Die! I'm going to look at the other two and start pulling out my bigger gun.","response":"DM: Make an intimidation check with advantage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And putting on the fucking mask.","response":"DM: With a d6 inspiration dice."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Picked a bad day to do your job, son!\nTALIESIN: A d6 inspiration die?\nMARISHA: And advantage. With advantage and a d6.\nTALIESIN: Oh, this is embarrassing. 17, wait with intimidation, 19.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Mask, gun, fuck it.","response":"DM: Standing there, smoking, giant hole, Tombstone style, in the center of his chest. There would be no dripping, except for the cauterization of the heat round that exploded in his chest and is a blackened, cinderous tube where once there was a chest cavity. The Broker (death rattle, thud) falls onto his back with a smoldering spiral of black smoke pouring forth from the chest wound on the ground. As you stare at the other two, screaming that out, you can see the old woman  who's still on the ground. (panicked gasps) Looks extremely out of place and freaked out."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Sorry, Doris. You'd better just lie down.","response":"DM: The masked individual, from what you can tell behind the eyes of the mask, does not seem emotionally affected by this."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Also, just checking, does my glove still have a charge, by the way?","response":"DM: It may."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. I mean, is there any indication, like it would have a slight glow to it.","response":"DM: There is a slight vibration. That ends your turn?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That is the end of my turn.\nLIAM: (old lady voice) I feel happy. I feel alive.\nSAM: You're in Atlantic City. Everything's okay.","response":"DM: As a bonus action, casts Misty Step and appearing 30 feet over here."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do I get to swing?","response":"DM: No. Because Misty Step happens."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Damn Misty and her steps.","response":"DM: She stands up and vanishes in a swirl of vapor. She appears a little ways away in the field and immediately, (mumbles a spell)."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Counterspell! 5th-level. Fuck it.","response":"DM: You would be able to, because it has been your turn, you would have your reaction back. So yes, you could. So go ahead and roll a d20."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Matt's like, damn you and your Counterspells. You're ruining my plan.\nORION: 23.\nTRAVIS: That's the best running I've ever seen! The little gait!","response":"DM: Tries to run away, the slippery wet grass, she slips a little bit as she's trying to get away now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I feel bad for her.","response":"DM: That ends her turn. Keyleth, you're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Upon seeing Percy go absolutely insane and screaming “Your soul is now forfeit,” out of shock, my Anti-Life Shell dissipates, and I spend my action staring at him.\nLIAM: Wow. Going for the roleplay, not the damage.","response":"DM: The Broker's not getting a turn. Lillith, you're up."}
{"prompt":"KIT: Okay. I would like to use Animate Dead on the Broker, please.\nLIAM: (gasps) You nasty woman, you.\nLAURA: He's so happy about it.","response":"DM: You can begin using it, because it's a one-minute casting time. You have to get closer because you're probably a ways away."}
{"prompt":"KIT: Right. Okay.\nLIAM: You've got a naughty streak.\nKIT: It's my family. I cannot help it.","response":"DM: We'll say, from there you begin concentrating on Animate Dead as you begin pulling through and speaking in guttural tones that have multiple layers of tonality and volume. It's this weird symphony of discordant voices as she begins to speak. You can see now the smoking, ruined body of the Broker begins to shift and twitch on its own. So that'll conclude your turn, Lillith. Vex and Tiberius, you guys are up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You've got asshole.\nLAURA: I'm going to attack him with a bow. I'm going to attack him with my Entangle arrow.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That old lady has to die!\nLAURA: That's a 28.","response":"DM: Yeah, that definitely hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's the arrow.","response":"DM: Right, the one that he built? So what happens is that the front of the arrow, it doesn't do any actual damage on the impact. Instead what it does is it, when it smacks into it, there's a pouch in the front that detonates from the impact and sends this very quick-setting tar, like glue substance. That just spatters across the body and lower torso, it expands like a foam. There's no damage on that one, but it's currently (grunts) grappled by it and cannot move from its place."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Awesome. And so I'll shoot another arrow at the other lady.","response":"DM: Okay. Go for it. Roll for an attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I know she's running away, but she's a bad guy. I didn't hit her, though.","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 16.","response":"DM: Heh. It's funny– mages don't have a lot of armor. Even with mage armor, you manage to hit her square in the back. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 16.","response":"DM: She goes (cries out) and stumbles, and catches herself and gets back up and you can see the arrow sticking straight up out of her back. Probably four inches into the back of her shoulder blade."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: This is becoming a Monty Python sketch.\nLIAM: (old lady voice) I feel fine. I feel happy.","response":"DM: Trinket growls (growls menacingly). She goes, (terrified shriek) and yelps out as the giant bear–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Will you start running for us again, please?","response":"DM: When we get to her turn. I'm saving it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to command Trinket to run after her.","response":"DM: What's Trinket's movement?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is like an afternoon at the gym for us.\nLAURA: I don't have any idea. I don't know.","response":"DM: Actually, I have it here. Trinket's movement is 40 feet. Okay, that's as far as Trinket can get right there. I have a little Trinket cheat sheet."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That is the tiniest cheat sheet ever.\nLIAM: Littlest character sheet ever. Can you hold that up again? Look how tiny it is! Aw, that big bear and that tiny piece of paper.","response":"DM: Okay, Scanlan, you're up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, the guy in the mask is prone?","response":"DM: The guy in the mask is currently grappled. His lower body is currently held in this weird tar-like substance. He's like, (grunts) trying to break free."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I only get one 6th-level spell but it says on Eyebite that every subsequent action, I can do it again.","response":"DM: You just choose somebody else to do it to, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to do it to her again. To the old lady again.","response":"DM: Let me see if you can. For another creature. But can't target a creature again– oh, if it succeeded on a saving throw. You're right, so she can. So what do you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think it's Tiberius's turn. He and I have the same initiative.","response":"DM: Oh, that's right, sorry about that."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, are you going to hold?","response":"DM: So he waits for you to finish. But he can hold his turn."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'll just run up, as far as I need to be within 60 feet and do it again to her.","response":"DM: Yeah, she's within range. And what're you doing?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Just fall asleep again. Back to sleep.","response":"DM: That is a 17. Nope. (panicked breathing) Falls asleep on the ground. With the arrow (arrow twang) right out of the back. And you acquiesce to Tiberius. It's your go."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That was a wonderful toot, Scanlan!\nSAM: Yes, thank you.\nORION: Where do I put this d10? Doesn't matter. Cool. I'm going to go as far as I can towards the old broad.\nMARISHA: We're focusing so much on this poor old woman and there's big intimidating–\nLIAM: Poor old woman? She's an evil mercenary. She deserves to be taken out!\nORION: He hasn't taken any damage, has he?","response":"DM: He's taken quite a bit of damage"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Don't be ageist! That is an evil bitch! She needs to be killed.\nTRAVIS: Ageist?\nORION: Am I within 60 feet of the old lady? That's pretty far still. Don't know whether I am or not.","response":"DM: Nope, she's just out of the range."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I've fallen, and I can't get up!\nORION: Okay. I am within 120 right? So what I'm going to do instead, is I'm going to look down and I'm going to pull out my Krull Blade and I'm going to throw it in the air and cast Telekinesis on it (spinning).","response":"DM: Okay. As you do it catches itself, spinning in the air up ahead of you, (spinning) this strange vibrating high-pitched whine sound as the blades are spinning in rapid circular motion."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And I'm going to go, (swishing) and I'm going to huck it at the chick.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and roll a spell attack roll."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's 31.","response":"DM: Yeah. It's also a critical hit because she's currently asleep. So it's an auto-crit. So go ahead and roll 5d4. A d4 for each dagger on the spinning blade, spinning at high speed. Plus five. Or 5d4 times two plus five."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 5d4 times two plus five?","response":"DM: Yep. So just roll 5d4 and then multiply everything by two."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13.","response":"DM: So 26 plus five is 31 points of damage. The unconscious woman face down on the ground, the blade tears through and grinds a large wedge out of her back. Spraying a bit of gore across the nearby grass. Thankfully, she was asleep, so she probably didn't feel it, it was so fast. But she is definitively gone."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We are being sadistic today.\nORION: And I'll bring it back to me. I'll keep it hovering, maintain the spell. I'm going to bonus action Misty Step towards where Grog is. That's my turn.","response":"DM: I'll say for the sake of brevity at this point, because you have a glued guy, and the entire team pretty much at full health here, over time you all slowly gather around the guy who's glued to the ground. And he's fighting at first, (grunts) and you see he lowers his head, giving into his fate."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Smart to not test your fate, boy.\nTRAVIS: Lillith, can I go play t-ball with his head?\nLIAM: No. Let him live. Let this one live.\nTRAVIS: What, we're letting people live now?","response":"DM: At which point the head lifts he goes: “No. Kill me, give me honor. I have fallen.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry I retract that.\nORION: Krull Blade in the neck.\nMARISHA: Oh you just elbowed me.\nLIAM: Did you just hit Keyleth's funny bone?\nMARISHA: Yes, right in the funny bone.\nORION: It's kind of funny.\nLIAM: Grog, will you kill this guy?\nKIT: If honor is what he wants, do not give it to him. Let him live.\nLAURA: Ooh, I like it. I walk up and I take his mask off.\nLIAM: I know what to do– Scanlan. This is your moment. Shit on his face.\nLAURA: No, that's disgusting!\nSAM: Listen, that's not just something I can do whenever.\nLIAM: Who are you kidding?\nLIAM: My sister's right. Do it on his chest.","response":"DM: At which point, you pop the mask off, and from immediately beneath it reaches up and covers the face–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: This is the Broker?\nLAURA: This is the masked guy.","response":"DM: You can the face beneath. It's humanoid, but right as you get past the nose and the mouth area, it's all melted, like a horrible acid burn. There's severe damage to the face. He looks at you and goes “Kill me. It's all I have.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sorry, darling. You live.","response":"DM: (angry growl) And it's flexing and reaching out at you but it can't quite get the range. It's going to attempt to try to– no it just cannot break free of that (strained grunts). As you're still concentrating on the spell, slowly the Broker steps up, the eyes rolled back and white, the giant wound in the chest, hobbles towards you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It was almost my turn. Can I throw daggers at him?\nLAURA: No, she just reanimated him.\nLIAM: You reanimated him? Oh then, never mind. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.","response":"DM: As you pull your blade out, she commands and gives a hand motion, and the Broker hobbles towards her."}
{"prompt":"KIT: My sisters, they sent you? They are still hunting me?","response":"DM: You look down. The mark that was there on your chest has vanished. Upon the point of the Broker's death, whatever enchantment was placed upon you that was keeping you under his gaze was abolished."}
{"prompt":"KIT: Return to Palac Lusterka and present yourself to my sisters. Let them see what good it will do them to hunt me.","response":"DM: Turns around and starts shambling off."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, wait a minute, hold on. And I as he's walking away, I'm going to loot that dude. Take shit off him. Come on. Hold on, let me take this.","response":"DM: There is a mostly ruined set of studded leather armor that is enchanted, plus one. It's basic, but it's need of serious repair as it currently has a large gaping hole in the chest area. And a shortsword. Plus-one Vicious Shortsword. As Tiberius is pulling everything off of the corpse as it's trying to shamble away into the distance. Eventually, this half-naked ruined body of this tiefling begins stepping off into the night."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What about the old lady? Do we get any loot off her?\nLAURA: Here's a wand. I toss it back to them.\nLIAM: Scanlan? Tibs? Who wants a wand?","response":"DM: Plus-one Wand of the War Mage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Plus-one Wand of the War Mage.","response":"DM: A simple Ring of Protection."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: There's a ring. I take it, put it on. For the time being.","response":"DM: And about roughly 320 gold. Amongst the two of them. At this point in time, the other guy's exhausted himself now, just still in place. You see the Broker vanish into the shadows, heading southward."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Shall we throw him in the pen with the other guy?\nORION: Hold on a second, why would we keep this one around to tell us now? What'd be the point? I will kill this man unless you give me a good reason not to.\nKIT: I look at him and I ask, this? My sisters, they are responsible for this?","response":"DM: He gives you a look for a second. “I've been this my whole life. They gave me purpose. I follow them, and you've hurt the Mistresses.”"}
{"prompt":"KIT: That is true. I did do something similar to Bellenore's face. But they will not give you purpose. You are better out of their shadow. Trust me, I know. You should find better purpose for yourself. Go. Be free. I doubt that they will trouble you any more.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Plus? Plus zero.\nSAM: You still have my inspiration.\nLAURA: Inspiration! Plus ten!\nKIT: 15?","response":"DM: 15. The tension in the muscles eventually relaxes, and the head hangs. “I know not for what reason I live.”"}
{"prompt":"KIT: You seem a capable fighter, yes? My cousin recently became member of the Slayer's Take in Vasselheim. Perhaps you would care to go find purpose in testing your skills there?\nLAURA: And if not there you can always fight in the Crucible.","response":"DM: (grunts)"}
{"prompt":"KIT: They look for nothing but strength and honor.","response":"DM: At which point there's a large cracking sound as the hardened foam breaks from one leg. (grunts) Breaks the other leg free and stands there now before you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Your purpose in life is only what you make of it.\nSAM: You can do anything. You could be President of the United States.\nORION: While this is going on, I'm writing on a piece of scroll right now. Which I give to him.","response":"DM: “I will walk, and I will think. Perhaps I will drown.” And he turns and starts walking towards the shoreline on the other side to the west–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Lillith, does this mean you are free from those who are hunting you?\nKIT: I'm very much afraid not. This is but one of the attempts my sisters have made to find me. However, I have no intention of returning to my home.\nMARISHA: And what was the name of your homeland again? It sounded very exotic.\nORION: Not tourist-friendly?\nKIT: Not particularly welcome, no.\nLAURA: I've heard some terrible things about– what is it, your father, is it? Or is it your uncle? Your uncle.\nKIT: My family in general have interesting attitudes towards affection, shall we say. My sisters– well, you see, I'm not particularly cut out for making a good first impression. However, my sisters did always tell me that what was inside was most important. They did tell me this as they were removing intestines to divine with them, so perhaps maybe not usual meaning of this phrase, but Zahra is perhaps the member of my family that I like best.\nLAURA: Understandably.\nMARISHA: We all have those.\nLIAM: All we care about is deeds. You've proven yourself to great depth today.\nKIT: I believe in this circumstance I pale to my present company. I've heard many wonderful things about you from Zahra, and I'm honored to not only have met you, but also to have had your aid in this matter. I'm profoundly grateful. If there is ever any opportunity at which I can return the favor, I am not useful for much, but perhaps a little smoke and mirrors I can do.\nORION: I would actually like to know how you keep your horns so shiny and clean.","response":"DM: The cold wind picks up as the night air begins to darken, a distant storm blowing over the horizon to the northeast. The time draws late and cold."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Lillith, would you like to stay the night before you move on?\nKIT: If I would not put you at any–\nLAURA: Not even a little.\nMARISHA: Please, have dinner with us.\nKIT: Then it would be my pleasure.\nLAURA: And we head back to the keep.\nMARISHA: And I go in the back into the garden, and I take the glissfoil out of my pocket that I was given, and I revive it from its dried state that it was given to me in, and plant it in the ground.\nLIAM: And as the twins are walking I say, clearly, I'm eating shit here today. I guess I'm going to make a promise not to stray from your side.\nLAURA: Remember that promise.\nLIAM: I promise.\nSAM: I lick Tiberius.\nORION: That's what that feels like.","response":"DM: That will be our freeze-frame credit high-five for the evening."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Nice job, Kit!","response":"DM: Thank you so much, Kit, for guesting with us this evening, and for coming out and visiting us."}
{"prompt":"KIT: Thank you so much for having me. We've had an absolutely amazing week and– oh, it's really nice to speak in my own accent again.\nTALIESIN: Your accent good. We enjoy.\nKIT: Thank you. No, it's been absolutely amazing. It really has been an honor and you will definitely be seeing me again in LA, because this was wonderful. Thank you so much.\nTRAVIS: Yeah!\nLAURA: And everybody check her out on twitter.\nMARISHA: What's your twitter?\nKIT: My twitter is AnemoneTea dot– not even dot com, just AnemoneTea. It's that simple.","response":"DM: Travis and Laura have to run to catch a plane flight. You guys go, rock it out, safe flight. You guys are off to…?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: A wedding. And our anniversary is tomorrow.\nTRAVIS: But we got to go.","response":"DM: Go. Travel safe. Bye, guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I love you guys.\nLIAM: Can I hold your mug? I want to see what it feels like. Wow! Look at the size of that.\nSAM: It's still got some booze in there, if you want to take a slurp.\nLIAM: Yes.\nKIT: That's amazing!","response":"DM: The Broker was designed by one of our viewers, one of our Critters."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Thank you for the target practice.\nKIT: Thank you so much!\nMARISHA: That is so cool.\nKIT: That's amazing.","response":"DM: We're hoping to do stuff like that every now and then in the future to bring in some Critters to throw their creative mind in here and incorporate a character into our world. My heart's been going a mile a minute that entire game, because no DM wants to have to kill a player."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I was on the verge of bawling my eyes out.\nLIAM: If I ever died, I thought– and I still think I'll probably be the first– but if I ever died, I thought it would be more like a bus accident. I would just go (impact) and that'd be it. I didn't think the doctor would look at me and say, I'm sorry, you have one week to live. And the whole week I've been sweating.","response":"DM: Yeah, it's pretty harsh. The internet was very vocal."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, thanks guys, for putting the pressure on.","response":"DM: Oh man. Well, that was awesome."}
{"prompt":"[end of transcript]","response":"DM: Welcome back! So picking up after the events of last week, to give you guys a little bit of a refresher. After the party had returned from their journey into Vasselheim for quite a few weeks, they discovered upon returning that the illustrious Briarwoods, current owners of Castle Whitestone and overseers of the entire city of Whitestone and sticking point in Percy's background, were coming to Emon to meet for essentially a political banquet with Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei to discuss construction of a bridge. It was a very political endeavor. And the council of Tal'Dorei was invited, including Vox Machina. There was a week of preparation in going into this event to see exactly what the Briarwoods were about. Information was gathered at this banquet. Vax went on his own little adventure into the Briarwoods' room, in which they nearly killed him. (chuckles)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hey, everybody!","response":"DM: I didn't notice the shirt until now. So yeah, the party rushed out to his aid. Much violence ensued. The Briarwoods eventually escaped through some sort of magical means that was not uncovered. However, they are no longer in the picture. The party was left with a destroyed carriage, a young carriage driver who had his hand shot off by Percy, and was then told to the guards to haul off and bring to their keep to throw into their cell for further questioning. Uriel was eventually drawn out and confused by the sudden chaos and vehemently requested that Vox Machina return the next morning to go over what has transpired. After which, the party during this event had encountered a tiefling by the name of Lillith, who was masquerading as one of the servants within the palace of Tal'Dorei. Aided them in the battle and revealed that she was being hunted by her sisters in a distant land and revealing herself here essentially opened up her physical presence to be pinpointed and then immediately sought and hunted by whoever was after her. The party then brought her back to the keep. They were on the way back before they were encountered by this bounty hunter and a small team of individuals that were coming with him to seek down, capture Lillith, and bring her back to her sisters. The party then defended her in this circumstance, brutally murdering one of them. Sorry, brutally murdering two of them. One of which was then raised and sent off as a present to the sisters by Lillith. One was salvaged, not given an honorable death, and sent to find his way somewhere northwest of Emon. Possibly towards Vasselheim or wherever else he may find his adventure. They then gave Lillith the opportunity to come stay the night to rest in the keep and they\nall made their way back to Greyskull Keep for the evening. And that was where we left off. So as the evening progresses you all manage to get your rest and gather your thoughts over the rather stressful experience you had the previous evening within the palace. The next morning comes around. You all come to consciousness. Breakfast is prepared by the servants of the keep. As you all wake up, start getting your meals and gathering what you want to do for the day, two individuals have not come down for their meal. Lillith and Percy."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Good morning, everyone!\nSAM: Not everyone. We're missing two. A male and a female.\nLAURA: Oh. No.\nTRAVIS: You don't think?\nLAURA: Percy was upset.\nSAM: Maybe he needed some comforting.\nORION: Oh, I see. Are you saying they're having relations?\nSAM: I'm not saying that.\nLAURA: Perhaps we should check on them?\nTRAVIS: We should totally check on them!\nSAM: Okay, but if there's a sock or a gun on the doorknob, don't go in.\nLAURA: Or a ribbon. She wore a ribbon.\nORION: Well, I was thinking last night, Grog, that we're probably going to be here for a little bit before going anywhere. Do we go anywhere?\nLAURA: We have to go see Uriel.\nORION: Who? Oh. Right! Yes! Also, I really want to see Allura. For no particular– actually for very specific reasons. Yes.\nTRAVIS: I think he's lying.\nORION: One of them is: I want to pick up one of the Earrings of Telecommunication. It has been finished for quite some time. We just have to go to where she resides to pick it up. Then one of us could have another one.\nLIAM: That robe just takes it to a whole new level!\nLAURA: Yeah, it really does.\nORION: I feel so good.\nLIAM: I'm somewhat entranced.\nORION: I'm telling you, it's helping, too.\nTRAVIS: Do I feel a little tingle from my belt? And can I roll for a beard check?\nSAM: Oh, beard check?\nTRAVIS: Six. Two.","response":"DM: You wake up, realizing that the morning has transpired. You reach up and grab. And what you guys notice as he comes up is there is a dark charcoal smear across one side of his face where facial hair would once be, to match the other side that is currently beautiful, coiffed and shining in the dapples of morning light that come through the keep window."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You know the remedy for it, you just turn your face in the looking glass.\nLAURA: Yeah, from this angle you look amazing Grog.\nTRAVIS: My god, I'm so handsome. Right? And then just horror. Sheer horror.\nORION: (poof) A little dust and fix that for him.\nLAURA: Oh, so it looks normal again? I like it! Yeah. Beautiful. Don't touch it.","response":"DM: The color's a little off, but it looks better than not having it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: In my head you're like those Mr. Wooly magnetic toys when you're a kid.\nTRAVIS: I would shave it and get it even, but let's be honest, given history, it's going to take care of itself soon enough. These things don't live very long.","response":"DM: You knock on the door. A moment passes. No response."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lillith? Are you with Percy? Lillith?","response":"DM: You knock a second time and the door (creaks) opens a little bit. It has not really been locked or closed."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I peek my head in.","response":"DM: You peek in and look."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Did you check for traps?","response":"DM: Roll a– no, I'm kidding."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Damn it!","response":"DM: Already off! No. As you peek into the room, the lights are dimmed. What little bit of candles are in there are already down. Glancing in, the sheets are clean and set, the bed's been made, and there is a small piece of parchment that is folded on the edge of the bed."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Go and read it.","response":"DM: Read it? It reads, “Vox Machina, thank you all for your hospitality and protection through this past evening. I would stay, but the longer I remain, the more danger I am in, and as such, put all of you in as well. I shall travel across the Ozmit Sea to seek the guidance of my cousin Zahra, in hopes of finally getting out from under my sisters' baneful gaze. Nevertheless, I wish you all the finest of journeys, and I hope we meet again soon. Lillith.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: She's so cute.\nMARISHA: I liked her bow. It was cute.\nLAURA: I tell everyone that she's gone. Gone.\nTRAVIS: No, she's in Percy's room! Scanlan, let's go see if he's banging!","response":"DM: You run up and Percy's room is– the door is already partially ajar."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (boom)","response":"DM: It bursts open. (wham) Slams on the side of the door, looking in the room. He's not there, is the first thing you notice. However, what you do see are a series of different books of sketches and designs and half-concocted blueprints for different things are crumpled and torn across the room. The bedsheets are thrown off the bed. It looks like the room has been continuously tossed through some sort of frenzied action, either seeking something or just out of emotional frustration. This room is left in far more disarray than you're used to seeing true to Percy's character."}
{"prompt":"SAM: My god, Grog. Percy's a hoarder.\nTRAVIS: Right.\nSAM: Or he's in serious distress.\nTRAVIS: I think it's the previous.\nSAM: The hoarder?\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Probably.\nSAM: We must find him, don't you think? Our friend's in trouble. I proceed down to his tinkering lab. Doesn't he have some sort of lab downstairs?\nTRAVIS: My room's like shit, and I'm not in trouble.\nSAM: Well, that goes with your character.","response":"DM: Yeah. You head down to the basement area, and to the right is the cell, to the left is the workshop. The workshop door is currently closed. There is a small slider eye vent where you can peek through."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I reach the eye vent?","response":"DM: You can if you leap hard enough and catch it on the edge."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I boost him up.","response":"DM: Okay. Looking inside, you can see, the forge is aglow. You hear the tangs of metal being hammered against the anvil, and you can see the form of Percy framed against the backlighting of the forge. He's feverishly working away on some sort of project."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is he naked?\nSAM: No, he's working too hard. Maybe we should just leave him be. Seems focused, driven, like a madman.\nTRAVIS: Oh. I get it. Like a madman?\nSAM: I don't think you do.","response":"DM: At which point a voice rings out from across the room: Percy unmoving, still continuing his work, shouts over his shoulder, “Please, leave me be. I have a lot to think about right now.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Would you like a meal brought down?","response":"DM: “I'm fine. Thank you. Really. I need some time.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I drop Scanlan and I lean in and I go, beware the water! It burns!","response":"DM: “Yes. Yes, it does, Grog. Good boy.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Understandable.\nLIAM: Let him get it out of his system.\nMARISHA: I'm really worried about him.\nSAM: Yes.\nORION: Matthew? Rolling– 12. I'm just trying to teach my pet something but I rolled a 12.","response":"DM: For?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, I want it to follow. To follow.","response":"DM: To follow. Okay. You gather, based on the recent intensity of trying to teach things to Lockheed over the past week. You succeed in a few. There is a bit of balking frustration that perhaps you've overstepped a little bit, and Lockheed feels maybe there's less of a friendship here more than a real master-servant relationship, at least in this moment, and does not seem to be receptive to your attempt."}
{"prompt":"ORION: He's in a mood, also. Why is everybody in a mood today?\nSAM: I know. Percy's hate-smelting downstairs.\nLAURA: Percy has good reason to hate-smelt. He seems rather disturbed that the Briarwoods got away.\nSAM: Yes. I feel responsible.\nMARISHA: Out of curiosity, did anyone else hear him– did anyone else just happen to hear what he said in that fight last night?\nLAURA: I was a little bit preoccupied by watching him shoot a servant boy over and over and over again.\nMARISHA: It was after that, actually.\nLAURA: What did he say?\nMARISHA: Never mind.\nSAM: What? No, spit it out. What did he say? It seems important.\nMARISHA: It's hard to say. You know Percy. I don't know where he gets these lines.\nSAM: Is it fuck? Is it shit?\nTRAVIS: Cock! Bulls! Dong! Wang!\nLIAM: Steampunk!\nMARISHA: Jeez. Okay.\nTRAVIS: Donkey wang!\nMARISHA: This is getting really off subject.\nORION: I'm going to go down to my laboratory.\nLAURA: What did he say?\nMARISHA: It was when he was screaming the cluster of things as he was shooting that mercenary in the face, and he said, “What are you doing? You have no reason to be here. Your soul is now forfeit.” Really, that last part is the most important one. The first stuff is fairly average. But yeah, “Your soul is now forfeit.”\nTRAVIS: It's a good line.\nLAURA: It's a really good line.\nSAM: Thought he was just trash-talking. You think there's more to it?\nMARISHA: I thought it was maybe a line and then it seemed really aggressive and strong and specific, so it made me think a lot. I don't know.\nLAURA: Did you ask him about it at all?\nMARISHA: We haven't seen him since that happened.\nTRAVIS: What do you think?\nLAURA: What, do you think his Pepperbox is– what?\nMARISHA: I think he's not telling us everything, that's for sure.\nSAM: Well, we all have some secrets.\nMARISHA: Yeah. But screaming, “Your soul is now forfeit?” That's not a secret. That's saying you peed the bed when you were a kid.\nLIAM: I worry, too, but he did lose his entire family.\nLAURA: He did pee the bed when he was a kid.\nMARISHA: Oh, really?\nLIAM: I am assuming. But he lost his entire family to those people.\nMARISHA: Sure. But he wasn't screaming this at the Briarwoods. He was screaming this at a random mercenary.\nLAURA: Well?\nMARISHA: What does that mean?\nTRAVIS: Maybe his soul is forfeit.\nMARISHA: To what?\nTRAVIS: Death?\nLAURA: Maybe we keep an eye on Percy.\nSAM: That's a fair point, though. We'll keep an eye on him. He seems to be in a fragile state right now.\nLAURA: Percy's not the one who killed a poor old woman, though.\nSAM: Did we kill her? I thought we just made her sleep and then walked away.\nTRAVIS: Nope. No. Total massacre.\nLAURA: Tiberius destroyed her.\nSAM: Tiberius, you killed an old woman?\nORION: I'm not there.\nMARISHA: Yeah, that's actually another thing I wanted to talk about. That was also really intense. You know, I get it. It was a hard day. It was a hard day, and we tend to get a little aggressive sometimes after hard days. We've all been there. But he didn't just murder an old woman. He chainsawed her. A sleeping,  unconscious woman.\nTRAVIS: It was pretty great!\nSAM: Are you saying that we should take it down a notch? Or maybe not brutally destroy the bad guys?\nMARISHA: You also were the only other one who seemed to be confused as to what was going on.\nLAURA: I shot her. I shot her in the back. Let's be honest. I didn't chainsaw her, but I did shoot her in the back as she was running away.\nSAM: I made her go to sleep. That was peaceful.\nMARISHA: That's what I'm saying. That was good. That was nice.\nLAURA: I was aiming for her shoulder, if it makes any difference.\nTRAVIS: She did have that sweet little run, which was so cute.\nSAM: Are you taking moral exception to some of our behavior?\nMARISHA: That might exactly be what I'm saying. Man, you see this is why I like you, Scanlan. You're so much better at the words than me. I don't think I even knew that's what I felt until you said it just now.\nSAM: Well, this is something perhaps you should pray on and think on. If there's something you'd like us to change about our behavior, we can consider that. We're all friends. We're allies here. We should pay respect to you.\nMARISHA: I just don't want us to–\nLIAM: It's a fair point. We don't want to be corrupted by the very evil that we mean to stamp out in this world. She was trying to kill us. But your point is taken.\nMARISHA: She was a really old woman.\nLIAM: But she wasn't the secretary. She was trying to kill.\nMARISHA: Sure. But she was unconscious.\nTRAVIS: She actually didn't do anything, either.\nMARISHA: Yeah, she didn't really do anything at all.\nTRAVIS: She could have been taking notes.\nLAURA: She had a wand!\nMARISHA: I'm not saying she wasn't a threat and I'm not saying we shouldn't handle threats. I'm saying maybe we shouldn't dissect a woman with a spinning Krull blade who's sleeping on the ground. Defenseless, running away. She was fleeing.\nLIAM: I don't know! I mean, I see what Keyleth's saying, but I don't really want to cramp your style, Scanlan.\nSAM: Oh, I'll shit on things. Maybe not people.\nLIAM: We're like the A-Team, and that's your specialty. I don't really want to– See, you should just shit when you feel the urge.\nLAURA: What time is it? Do we need to be getting to Uriel?\nTRAVIS: Oh yeah, what time is it?","response":"DM: At this point, it's probably pushing on 11 am, close to noon."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should probably be getting to the palace.","response":"DM: Tiberius, what did you say you were doing down there? What did you say you were doing down in your laboratory?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, I was doing my research on that stuff last night and this morning.","response":"DM: Your which one?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's just my ability because of my class. I do the backstory.","response":"DM: Your backstory is?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I am a noble sage.","response":"DM: Well, there's a noble and there's a sage."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yeah, I know, and I spliced them because it made sense. No. The noble part is the RP. The sage is the perk.\nORION: And I was writing down the sigil to the keep. That's completed.\nORION: Wonderful.\nTRAVIS: Do you want to tell us what you've learned?\nORION: I did it right this time! Knowing that, I take some files and– I want to check if I can– Nope. I can't do anything yet. That's it. I'm going to go upstairs.","response":"DM: Okay. So as you guys have gathered the time and what you might be, going forward, doing for the rest of the day, Tiberius comes upstairs with a bit of a smile and an air of confidence."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh good, you're back.\nLIAM: Tibs, we were just discussing the future of the group and the direction we've been taking. And a point was introduced that maybe perhaps, we started as a sort of a– mercenary group is a bit strong– but this alliance we have formed out of convenience. We all needed to eat. But now that we're at the stature we are, in a keep, in Emon. Friends to the emperor. We want to figure out what we're doing here. Do we want to be just powerful badasses who walk around getting what they want, or are we trying to enact some positive change in this world?\nORION: Yes, absolutely. That's what my items are for. I've only found one of them. There are still three or four, if they even exist out there. There are countless things to go and venture forth and explore.\nTRAVIS: What? Your items?\nORION: The artifacts, the Ring of Boros, the old hag. That is the next step in my quest. She told us it would be in the Feywood. Right?","response":"DM: Feywild. Close. Researcher."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That is where we need to go. But that's why we ran into her in Vasselheim, and she wouldn't tell me anything more.\nMARISHA: How do you plan to use your items? For better good in the world?\nORION: Well, you've seen how I've used my Mending Wheel. Countless ways.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, thank you. You healed my cask. I'll always be grateful.\nORION: Moreover, it would prove to the council that all of the things that I went on this journey for to begin with, it was true. Or for naught. And really, to gain the respect of my father and everyone else. You don't know how hard it is to be a chromatic dragon in a metallic world! It's not easy.\nLIAM: Well, there's no question that you are an invaluable member of Vox Machina, and our friend, and our family. And that is not in question.\nORION: Of course. Which is why I have pledged my loyalty to you all. And I need your strength, as well. There is no way I could accomplish in my mission alone. I mean, Grog, when I ran into you in that one bar. How many men were you beating up? I counted eight, if I recall.\nTRAVIS: I think that sounds right.\nSAM: He can't count.\nTRAVIS: It's that many.\nORION: Here was this brute who I would have ran away from, but here you were, and I found you to be rather charming. I figured, well, that's some good company to keep, rather. And then I met the rest of you, and look where we are now!\nLAURA: Yes. Tiberius, the point of this is you killed an old woman last night, very brutally. Please maybe don't do that again.\nORION: She felt nothing, but of course. And I was giving my new Krull blade a good old try.\nLAURA: Yes, you were. Maybe not on sleeping people anymore. People who are actually attacking us.\nORION: She was– okay, fine.\nLIAM: Well, I think the point is your abilities in arcane wonder are expanding daily. Exponentially. And perhaps be a little tentative. Do a little practice run in the woods on your own, once in a while, and see what the effects are before you go whipping it out.\nORION: Are there woods nearby?\nSAM: This is an intervention. We love you very much, but you killed an old lady.\nTRAVIS: I like the way you kill people.\nORION: Well, yes.\nLAURA: We're all on the up and up now, right?\nORION: One raises a hand to me or Vox Machina, they are going to die.\nTRAVIS: Yeah! Yeah, they are!\nORION: It is simple. I do not know why this is a discussion. I won't be as cruel–\nMARISHA: You know, she didn't even really do anything. She was really old.\nLAURA: She was attacking us.\nLIAM: Keyleth.\nMARISHA: What?\nLIAM: Clearly, we all love you as family, and nobody blames you, but you once killed a child, and none of us blame you for that.\nTRAVIS: Is it too early to start drinking? I pull out the cask of ale.\nLIAM: And that happened in the heat of battle.\nMARISHA: You know, I'm really sensitive about that, Vax. I'm really sensitive about that, Vax!\nLIAM: I'm well aware.\nMARISHA: And that was different.\nLAURA: It was an accident!\nMARISHA: That was pretty fucking deliberate, what he did.\nORION: Yes, to someone who was opposing us. That was a child who was innocent. Or was he opposing us, too? I don't remember, actually.\nLIAM: And it all falls apart.\nMARISHA: He was being puppeted by sorcerer Michael Jackson.\nLIAM: No one agrees with you today more than I, and I think we can adjust our perspective slightly. Right, Grog?\nTRAVIS: What's the word?\nLIAM: See?\nSAM: Kill softer.\nORION: I'll show you how. You just have to do it really slow.\nLAURA: Uriel's waiting for us.\nSAM: Let's table this. We'll stick a pin in this discussion. We'll all be thinking long and hard about this.\nLAURA: Keyleth, it wasn't intentional and everybody knows that.\nLIAM: Absolutely. Not intentional. No.\nMARISHA: I turn into Minxie and start walking.\nTRAVIS: Minxie! I go and give a little scratch behind the ears.","response":"DM: You guys gather and make your way into the city of Emon proper."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Actually, before we head towards Uriel, we probably should– do we have any sort of proof that the Briarwoods actually did horrible things and it wasn't us attacking them?\nLIAM: Well, I've got these little scars right here.","response":"DM: The scars are still there. They're still wounds that are healing."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And then there was what's-his-name, Awesome Pants, who was there.\nLAURA: Seeker Asum.\nORION: Allura saw everything, as well.\nSAM: Did she see the fight?\nLAURA: Allura didn't see the fight.\nLIAM: We know she knows what's up, but whether she can be used as a reliable witness is– we've got multiple witnesses.\nSAM: There were those guards, too. There was guards outside the door.\nLIAM: They were incinerated.\nSAM: Oh yeah.\nLAURA: Plus, they were the Briarwoods' guards, anyway.\nORION: One of them was still alive. I didn't kill both of them.\nLAURA: He went away with the Briarwoods, I'm going to assume.\nTRAVIS: What a dick! We go to see Uriel.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I made a choice for the team!","response":"DM: As you're having this discussion, all of you make your way into the city of Emon, across the districts to the Cloudtop. You're greeted and let within the gate into the central district there. You make your way to the palace of Tal'Dorei, through the front doors. The guards that are there lead you in and one of them says, “Uriel is waiting within the throne chamber.” You guys are led down the main hallway into the very center of the palace."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I come out of Minxie.","response":"DM: The nervous guard, thankfully, puts his weapon away and is like, “Oh! Lady Keyleth, my apologies.” And puts his spear to the side."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket's still here, though.\nLIAM: I buzz over to that specific guard and say, do you have a lost and found here? I have this really badass serpent-style belt. Sometimes it crawls around on its own. Sometimes it's just a belt. And I lost it here the other night. And I'm really hoping– I mean, it ties everything together. Is there anyone I can check with?","response":"DM: “Check back after you've spoken with the Sovereign, please. Thank you.” Leads you guys on. As you head down the main hallway– and you recall this hallway. This was a long, dangerous trek the first time you came to the palace. This was where Uriel's family was possessed. This is where you had your battle with the glabrezu. This is where Pike was slain. This is where you had to pull the shadows from the bodies of his family. This is a very emotional place that you really haven't been to since that sequence of events. Walking in already has this tenuous state of low-simmering energy. As you're brought into the main chamber, you can see there is the dual thrones for Uriel and his wife. His wife is not present; his family is not present, just Uriel sitting on the throne. There are a few guards on the different entrances to the room. As you walk in, Uriel just sits there on the throne and gives you acknowledgment and ushers you into the room. You all step in. Trinket behind you keeping an eye out. Like a bear is wont to do. You guys make your way up towards the very edge of the central raised dais where the  thrones are currently set up on. You now see on the opposite side of the room, Seeker Asum and Allura walk in, as well as Arbiter Brom, who is the cleric that is the Master of Law in the city. They walk up and flank the sides of the throne, stepping back a little bit to not gather all the attention, but definitely be there as a show of support. As they enter, the doors on the other side of the room and the door behind you open, and roughly 30 guards enter the chamber quietly. They all filter in, blocking all the exits. The doors close. No weapons are drawn, but there is a very strong showing of muscle in this room that you weren't expecting for this meeting. Once all the guards are settled and a really awkward silence hits the room, Uriel stands up from the throne and looks upon you. Pacing slightly, back and forth. “Thank you all for joining me. I must say, I am troubled by recent events, and I wish to speak to you regarding them before taking any action. I owe you that much for all you've done for me. Before you left for Vasselheim, you showed immediate interest in the Briarwoods. Percy in– Where is Percival?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, he's not feeling well today after the events of last night, so he stayed behind.\nORION: Yes!","response":"DM: “Now, I am quite disturbed by the events of these past 14 hours, and I would like to hear an explanation. Arbiter, if you could please, prepare the space.” Arbiter Brom steps forward and pulls forth from underneath his robes a necklace that contains a holy symbol. The same symbol you saw across the temple beneath the Slayer's Take, an eye-like inscription of the god Ioun. Brom grasps it, looks about you all, and prepares this slight hand gesture, and you feel a slight tingle across the skin that lasts a few seconds."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I recognize the spell he's casting?","response":"DM: I'll say go ahead and make a– this would be a religion check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He's doing a cleric thing, yeah? Seven.\nMARISHA: Son of a bitch. Always a problem.\nORION: 19.\nMARISHA: 11.\nSAM: I get advantage, and I rolled a 27.\nLIAM: 19.\nLAURA: 13.\nTRAVIS: 18.\nLIAM: I step forward.\nMARISHA: Can I do a quick insight check on Asum to see if I can still recognize if he's still affected by the mind-control thing?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an insight check, sure."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ooh yeah! 28.","response":"DM: Glancing at Asum, the way he's looking at you and the general tension and feeling of the room, you gather that Asum is not his normal self completely. You step forward."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Uriel. With all respect, I needn't remind you what the group of people before you put themselves through on your behalf and your family's behalf. We almost lost one of our own. And if that counts for nothing here, then nothing makes sense. But if that is not enough, let us start here.\nORION: The Briarwoods are vampires. And that old lady, who was a butthole by the way, was with this demonoid person who we had to fight as well.\nLIAM: One thing at a time. That's true, but one thing at a time. We had prior knowledge of the Briarwoods' intentions before this evening. And I myself went to spy on them.\nLAURA: Here's the thing. Percy doesn't like them because they killed his family. They took over his home, after killing his family. He got away. He knows they're scary. We're trying to protect you.\nORION: So the point is, we all know how dangerous it is that the knowledge of vampire existence and the spreading of those vile creatures. And now we know they do exist. So however the means that that came about is neither here nor there. We know where they are.\nTRAVIS: And if you're wondering how we know they're vampires– (whispering) Vax, this is your cue.\nLIAM: I will subject myself to any test, to any wizard or mage in this city who you know can ascertain the truth. To look through my eyes, to see my memories. I don't know shit about magic, but there are people who do.\nSAM: Cleric Tristan also treated him last night for his vampire-inflicted wound. I know this all looks really bad on the surface, and we did not want to cause any disturbance within these hallowed walls, but there was a danger, we acted. Perhaps too abruptly and without telling you.\nLAURA: We tried to get your attention. I called for you immediately. As soon as we knew there was danger.\nLIAM: And don't take our word for it. Anyone, have them look in here.\nORION: Actually, you take a Stormwind's word for–","response":"DM: “Silence! Silence. You're in my court now, Stormwind. You put so much weight upon this trust, and you have done a good service. But also I've heard whispers that you've thrown this trust around in many circles. Remember, we held a parade in your honor; we spread the word of the good deeds you've done. We, at our own  costs of Emon, built you a keep, a home, at great expense, to show thanks. And also, I believed, upon allowing you to join the council, put us square. I owe you nothing. Just as you owe me nothing.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do you not want the truth?","response":"DM: “I want the truth, but I also want you to understand the stakes that are here and why there is this question. As the leader of this– not this city, but this entire countryside, I have to be sure, and this is not the first time I have been lied to by very close, trusted people, so I have to be thorough.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is why I offer myself completely into your control and put myself under your supervision and any user of the arcane arts you want to  peer inside my mind, let them step up to the plate, because I have nothing to hide.\nLAURA: Also, while you are inquiring about him, you might inquire about Seeker Asum.\nSAM: If you're worried about lies within your own ranks, I think you should start with him.\nMARISHA: In fact, I actually might be able to help Seeker Asum, if you will allow me to.\nSAM: Help him?","response":"DM: You glance over at Asum, and Asum gives a look to Uriel and Uriel–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He was mind-controlled last night.","response":"DM: “I have had Asum at my side for the better part of 15 years. He is responsible, far more than your merry band has ever attempted, for keeping and maintaining the good and lawful state of this country.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Uriel, your own family was not themselves! And you know that! Look into my mind! Now! Today! You don't need to guess anything.","response":"DM: “It would also do you well to show respect. We are speaking, half-elf. Now, I would assign Allura to such an endeavor. However, it has also been noticed that she has grown quite friendly and attached to your group, and in this circumstance, there is question. So you will be, in a few days, assigned an individual to this ritual of which you are presenting yourself.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Uriel, please–","response":"DM: “Shh. The Briarwoods, regardless of what you may think they may be, or we do– that will show in time– have shown nothing over the past five years but graciousness, and gone through all proper channels to establish this relationship between our city and theirs. Far more than the previous family ever attempted.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, one may smile and smile and still be a villain.","response":"DM: “That goes both ways. Now, please.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just let me do a quick restoration spell on Asum. If nothing is wrong with him, nothing will happen. It's harmless. It's like taking medicine when you're not sick. It can't hurt. And if I am wrong, then we can continue on. We can have Vax tested. Please, it'll take ten minutes. What can it hurt?\nLAURA: Up until last night, he was himself. Trust us that now he is not.\nMARISHA: He came to us.\nMARISHA: First, I meditate for a second, and I cast Enhance Ability on myself.","response":"DM: As a note, as you begin casting, you notice the guards all go for their weapons and ready themselves, uncertain of what's about to transpire. There is a tension in the room based on what this is going to be."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh! (chanting)\nMARISHA: Am I maybe inspired by that?","response":"DM: Sure. In the tension of the room, this slow droning hum of the gnome, which you can notice some of the guards look at each other, confused. And Asum puts his hand up like, hold off."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Self.\nSAM: What ability?\nMARISHA: To enhance wisdom? Wisdom.","response":"DM: Okay. You reach out with Greater Restoration. You complete the ritual. You touch onto the arms of Asum. It fades, and you see in his eyes there's a moment of clarity and an inhale. A slight gasp, like some realization hits him and his expression changes and looks towards you and just goes– He puts his hands out like this for a moment, just trying to almost tell you something. Go ahead and make a wisdom check. Just a d20. Or no, make an insight. Make a straight insight. This is more of an insight roll here."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Oh! 29.\nSAM: Objection! That's it. I just wanted to say that. Please continue. I just want it noted that we object strongly to this.","response":"DM: “I understand. And this will only continue until all of our investigations are complete.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are we still allowed free rein to roam about as we please? Are we under arrest for anything?","response":"DM: “You are not under arrest. You are revoked from the council, and you will be closely watched until our investigations are complete.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How long will your investigations take?","response":"DM: He looks back to Asum and Asum says, “Well, depends on how quickly we can acquire the information; it could be weeks. I'll do my best to make it thorough and quick.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are we allowed to leave the city in that time?","response":"DM: Uriel looks back and says, “You may leave if you wish. Know that there have been precautions taken. Should you attempt to flee, we will find you.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And when are you to look into my mind?\nLAURA: Weirdo!\nLIAM: It freaking ends here. Right away.\nTRAVIS: Can you read my mind?\nLIAM: There is no spoon.","response":"DM: “We ought to speak to the Lyceum to find a proper individual of sufficient power and trust to do this, as Allura right now is being kept out of the scenario.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are we allowed to speak with Allura?","response":"DM: “If you wish. Outside of these chambers. Do what you must to clear your name. I would like very much for this all to be true, what you're saying. But do not flee. Do not give an inclination that you attempt to escape this judgment, for we will take that as a sign of guilt.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We've no intention of going anywhere.","response":"DM: “Should we conclude that your actions were beyond reason and the moral fiber of this council before your return, we will have no choice to put a bounty on your heads, should you not return. I really, really do not wish to do this. Do not make me do this.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I stand up. “No need for threats, friend. Are we done here?”","response":"DM: “I want to believe you all. I ask you, show that my trust has not been misplaced all this time. Now, you may leave.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I look forward to the second parade you'll throw for us after our names are cleared.","response":"DM: “Very well.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I turn to the guards that were grabbing at their weapons and I flex real fast at them and then I walk.","response":"DM: Four of them go, (yelps)."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Bitch!","response":"DM: As you guys go back out the doors that you entered, the guards now a little closely following as you exit, leading you out of the palace, down the front steps, and essentially stand at the front of the palace gates."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm sorry. I was just talking to one of your friends. Have you seen a belt that is shaped like a snake? Sometimes it moves around on its own. And it answers to the name Simon, but usually it's just a belt and looks really cool. Have you seen it? Is there a lost and found I can check out? It's very dear to me.","response":"DM: The guard just looks for a second and goes, “I think you've got more important matters to deal with before you go looking for a belt, sir.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Where's that other guy? He was more receptive to this. Do I see that other guy?\nLAURA: Darling. Seriously.","response":"DM: The guards all turn around and start ascending the stairs."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's on all the fan art. It really makes sense to have it on me.","response":"DM: They don't appear to be listening."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Keep an eye out for it. 100 gold to any chap who finds it and holds onto it for me.","response":"DM: Two of them stop in their step for a second and then keep walking."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm a nice guy!","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You're going to get six belts thrown at you.\nLIAM: That's terrible. Six.","response":"DM: It was a brief pause. But also. A brief pause."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You have a two in persuasion? Oh wow.\nSAM: We'll break in tonight and find it.\nTRAVIS: Could we wait outside for Allura?\nLIAM: I'll risk it all.\nSAM: Keyleth, what happened? Your magic didn't work?\nMARISHA: No, it worked.\nLAURA: What happened?\nSAM: But Asum lied.\nORION: He gave her a magic winky face.\nMARISHA: Yeah, essentially. Yeah. He gave me like a–\nLAURA: What does that mean? Does that mean Uriel's under their control? I don't understand.\nLIAM: Is he playing some sort of long game here?\nSAM: It must mean that we have something to fear from Uriel. Or someone else close.\nMARISHA: I don't know who to trust anymore, to be totally honest.\nTRAVIS: Really?\nMARISHA: It worked. I could feel it break. It worked, and he's got some sort of long game. I don't know if it's because he doesn't want Uriel to know, for whatever reason. I don't know if it's because he has some deeper, ulterior motive.\nLAURA: Do you think he was faking that he was healed, and maybe he wasn't?\nTRAVIS: Or maybe we have to bring proof of their vampirism back?\nMARISHA: No.\nTRAVIS: Oh.\nMARISHA: Wait. No to Vex. What was your question?\nTRAVIS: To bring back proof of them being vampires.\nSAM: Proof would help. Hey! Don't we have a prisoner? Can't we question the prisoner?\nLAURA: Is he bleeding out? What if he's dead? We're so screwed!\nMARISHA: I made sure.\nLAURA: Yeah, the guy that Percy shot the hand off of.\nMARISHA: I cauterized his wounds, remember?\nSAM: We should question him. He could have proof.\nLAURA: Oh shit! I hope everything's okay.\nORION: Wait a minute! I really need to go to Allura. She's our best interest right now.\nSAM: We get it! You want her body. Now's not the time.\nORION: It is beyond that. There are several reasons to go. We need to get the Earring of Telescription. I need her to enchant something for me, too. As well as the fact I fear that our keep may be in danger. I would like to ask her if she may be able to set up a warding spell for–\nMARISHA: Well, we can split up. I can go with you.","response":"DM: As you guys are having this discussion, the palace doors open and you hear the quick footsteps of Allura, rushing from the palace now, running towards you guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Saving the day. Again.\nMARISHA: Wait, she's coming out of the palace?","response":"DM: She's coming out of the palace, behind you guys. Like after the council had just closed. The meeting had finished. She basically gave chase to you guys and is now catching up to you on the street."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What the shit happened in there?\nMARISHA: We were just talking about you!","response":"DM: “Everyone– I don't fully know what happened last night, and–” She looks to you, Tiberius, and says, “You didn't, did you? Please tell me you did not kill that woman.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, I absolutely did!\nLAURA: But she was attacking us.\nSAM: It looks bad, but she was a threat.\nORION: Her and another one with this– what was he, a tiefling? Named the Broker attacked us. And that's why I killed her.","response":"DM: “Brom's divination is very clear. And he divined that the woman was currently filled with fear, attempting to flee, and unconscious when she was murdered.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How did she flee when she was unconscious?\nTRAVIS: She fled, went unconscious, then we butchered her.\nMARISHA: Just accept it for what it is, guys.","response":"DM: “I just worry. I know not what happened here, and I heard what you said, and I honestly do not trust the Briarwoods myself either. There was something about that meal and the conversation, and their presence that put me off entirely. It was strange. And what you say makes a lot of sense. Vampirism is a bit beyond what I was expecting. I did sense some powerful masqueraded arcane essence from Lady Briarwood. Look, I would recommend for this to do your best to be thorough in this. Bring back any and all information you can. From the words I hear, you probably have at best a few weeks before this comes to a close. And if you don't have enough evidence to support your argument– well, I don't know.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Allura, all I know how to do is break locks, but I've seen these people do things with magic that have defied expectations. Why can no one look into my memory? You have looked across miles. Cannot anyone look into my mind and see?\nLAURA: They're going to do it!\nSAM: Yes, but that might not be proof enough for them. Someone could have corrupted your mind.","response":"DM: “You have to understand. Not all arcane works that way. There are magics that can dabble in that realm, but none that specialize that here in Emon. Divination, yes there are elements of that. We can see the physical. We can see certain events. But to look into one's mind is a different magic entirely.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Are there no spells that can divine if someone's speaking true?","response":"DM: “That was attempted during that council, but after you left, Brom notified Uriel and the Council that many of you were resistant to the spell, and as such, it could not be verified.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: If we came back with proof?\nSAM: What sort of proof do you think they would accept? The head of Lady Briarwood?\nLAURA: No, because it'll disappear the minute we kill her or something. They're vampires, I don't know what they do.","response":"DM: She gives a thought to that. She goes, “Interestingly enough, if an artifact or an item brought forth from them could be divined, that should tell all.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is there still the remaining wreckage of their carriage? Is that still there?","response":"DM: “The carriage has been disposed. It's been picked over, and there were remnants within the rubble of some sort of a 'siggle' of teleportation. But that is no– a sigil, if you will.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Are we talking about that motherfucker's teeth?\nORION: I need to see that sigil.","response":"DM: “Sigil. We're all learning together. That, I believe, has all been investigated and kept under lock and key with Asum. You would have to speak with him. I would like to help. I cannot come with you. I'm working on something else at the moment. Ah!” And she reaches into her pocket and brings out your Earring of Transcription."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Thank you so much, Lady Allura!","response":"DM: As she hands it to you, she gives you a really, really concerned look. And just gives it to you and hands it back. And it's a look of– and it hits you: it's a look of disappointment with a hint of heartbreak."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, that's the worst! I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed. Ugh!\nLIAM: I feel like I've failed you.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: She looks back to you as you take it and goes, “Do your best to clear your name.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I shall.","response":"DM: “I know you come of noble blood, and many of you stand to inspire many others of noble blood. As celebrated heroes of this city, there is a lot more on the line here besides just your well-being. There's a lot of people in this town that look up to you. Nevertheless, I've already said more than I should. Good luck.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Thank you, Allura.","response":"DM: She looks behind and you can see she takes this small hood of the same material of her robe that she's wearing and puts it up over her head and rushes off towards her white tower towards the edge of the Cloudtop District."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Fucking politics.\nSAM: No one insight checked her.\nTRAVIS: She's telling the truth. Let's go make sure the prisoner isn't dead.\nLAURA: We say as we're walking back to the keep.\nSAM: We have a prisoner we can question. Who knows if that will yield anything. And then, we might have to go gather evidence, which means leaving town against his word.\nLAURA: Well, we're allowed to leave town.\nLIAM and SAM: No!\nLAURA: Yeah! No! He said we're allowed to leave. We just can't look like we're fleeing, so we tell them where we're going. They can even fucking follow us. I don't care.\nLIAM: So we tell them that we're going to their political– the people that they're trying to create a political relationship with? We're just going off to invade your political allies.\nTRAVIS: Oh come on! You half-elves. I swear to god! Have you never heard of lying before? Yeah! We don't tell them where we're going. We're going on a field trip. We're going to pick berries. Fuck all, but we go there.\nORION: The only way we can go there is telling them.\nTRAVIS: What? And we're going there, what for?\nORION: When I talk to Asum and get that sigil to that damn Briarwood keep. That's how we get there.\nTRAVIS: Why don't we say we're taking a picnic– oh, we took a wrong turn. Hey, it's the Briarwoods!\nORION: We don't have to lie to them. We tell them where we're going, and we can just go there.\nTRAVIS: We don't have to if we don't want to.\nLIAM: You're pretty.\nLAURA: Especially that beardy side, Grog.\nTRAVIS: It's a full beard right now.","response":"DM: What you do know is the sigil that a teleportation circle is attached to is known when you cast or create the circle. The circle does not necessarily indicate or maintain the sigil it's attached to."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's just a piece of it?","response":"DM: Meaning, there are two parts to it. There is the sigil that it sends to, and there is the actual ritual circle that is created. The circle that attaches to it is not the same as the destination. There are elements of it that connect it, but you would not be able to ascertain a sigil to Whitestone immediately from looking at the initial circle."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Thanks for the cups, guys! The cup.\nTRAVIS: I just noticed that!\nLIAM: Well, let's go check on this poor little shit in the dungeon.\nSAM: And then the next step will be to seek out Seeker Asum?\nORION: I'd like to stop by the temple real quick to pick up my decanter.\nSAM: How many errands do you have to run?\nLAURA: Endless errands.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I want to be there when we talk to the prisoner, too.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys make your way back to Greyskull Keep. Are you going with them or you're–"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm doing all the shit.","response":"DM: What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: He's got a list.","response":"DM: I would like to know the list."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to stop at an armory because I want my crossbow reinforced. I don't know what that means. I want to learn a different sigil. The one that I researched for the waste fair, or for the way– the Feywild! There's this big city next to it that I researched, that is near it, and in that city might be a sigil. So I'm going to go see if I can learn it. And then I want to come back and start enchanting my blades.\nSAM: It's a busy day.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I can give it to you. I wrote it down.\nSAM: Coming soon on Friday nights: The Adventures of Tiberius's Errands! 7:00 to 10:00 every Friday night on Twitch.\nORION: And then I have to go to the dry cleaners for my robe.\nSAM: Wait, what? Say that again.","response":"DM: There's two individuals waiting for you at the gate. You can see at a distance, but you don't recognize."}
{"prompt":"SAM: They're our handlers, probably.\nLIAM: Grog, come on. Let's go have a talk with someone.\nLAURA: I walk with you.\nSAM: We're all going!\nLIAM: Let's go arm in arm in one big line!\nLAURA: Well, they're right at our fucking keep. It's not like we're all headed in the same direction, anyway.\nORION: Who doesn't have a ring?\nSAM: A ring of what?\nORION: An earring.\nMARISHA: I have one right now.\nSAM: I think I do?\nLAURA: I have one.\nLIAM: I have one.\nLAURA: Grog doesn't have one.\nTRAVIS: How far away from the keep are we?","response":"DM: You're probably a good 100 to 150 feet."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I whistle really loud and say, who are these fucks in front of the keep? to the guard that we have employed.","response":"DM: Okay. So. Let me try and see who's on duty right now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He has notes on who is on duty.","response":"DM: This would still be Shayne and Cordell. Cordell shouts down from the top of the wall and says, “I don't think they're a threat.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right. We'll be the judge of that. As you were.\nSAM: Grog, keep in mind, these are our allies.\nLAURA: Hello!","response":"DM: As you walk up and you get close, you get a better view. You're expecting ominous, armored guards. Somebody possibly assigned to escort you. Instead, you're greeted by what looks to be an older couple waiting at the gate. A man and a woman, dressed in simple clothes, weathered skin. And as you go out to them, they both smile."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We hate old people.\nLAURA: Who are you?\nTRAVIS: Favored enemy!","response":"DM: They begin walking up, and the man steps forward. You can see he's got small dirty glasses at the end of his nose and says, “Hello, hello! Good afternoon, everyone! I'm sorry to be a bother. But unless my eyes and tales do deceive me, might you all be the heroes known as Vox Machina?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I insight check to see if these guys are legit?\nSAM: Legit what? Old people?\nLAURA: It could be Lord and Lady Briarwood, for all I know!\nLIAM: Me too. I did well. I rolled 18 on them.","response":"DM: Okay. From what you can tell, they are both happy, simple folk that are here with a tension of purpose, but nothing that seems to set off any alarms."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We are Vox Machina. I'm sure word of us has spread far and wide. We're a pretty big deal. Why have you made this journey to us?","response":"DM: The woman, who's holding his side, lets go of his arm and says, “We come to you humbly as representatives of the farming community just north of Emon's walls.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I love farmers!","response":"DM: “I am Riley Klaus and this is my husband, Ben.” “Pleasure to meet y'all.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hi.","response":"DM: “You see, many of us here, we make our living through livestock and small crops.” Ben takes over at this point and says, “Word is that the Sovereign will be calling down troops from Fort Daxio for a while, so the need for meats and fresh produce has been elevated.” The wife, Riley, then says, “Around this time, over the past two weeks, a number of our finest cows and sheep have gone missing. No struggle or mess or signs of dire wolves. Nothing! We suspected thieves,  initially, but we sent up our neighbor's boy Kyle to watch over them until sunrise and he saw the culprit. From what he described, a giant bird, larger than anything he's ever seen or heard of.” Ben then takes over the conversation, “Wings at least ten carts long, tip to tip. Just swooped down, he said, without sound and in one motion snatched up one of our most virile bulls. Mr. Simms, just gone like that!”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Mr. Simms?","response":"DM: “That was the bull.” Riley says, “Kyle said he saw it fly northwest.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Northwest? Can I do a nature check to see if I can recognize the creature he's describing?\nLIAM: Are we certain he's not describing a dragon?\nMARISHA: 26.","response":"DM: 26. You've seen some big birds in your time. This is, from what they're describing, a lot bigger than any birds you've encountered in your experience. You've heard whispers of larger birds in the wild, but you've never seen anything like that. You haven't had any personal experience hearing or seeing anything of this size."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But it is a bird?","response":"DM: That's what they described it as. At night."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: When did these birds start showing up?","response":"DM: “About two weeks ago when the whole thing started to happen.” And then Ben kicks in and says, “Should this keep up, most of us will lose everything before the year is out. Now, we've talked with the leaders of the farming community this side of Emon. We've scrounged up what we could.” And he brings up a couple of coin purses and she goes, “512 gold pieces, 37 silver, and 103 copper. That's all we can spare.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Keep your money.\nMARISHA: Yes, keep your money.","response":"DM: “We can't possibly–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: However, despite what my companion is saying, we are not agreeing to go after this winged beast quite yet. We hear your plight, and we sympathize, and we will do what we can, but we have very pressing matters right now. Is there a deadline of some sort? When is your next harvesting season?","response":"DM: “I mean, there's no deadline, but the longer that goes by, the more and more we lose by the night. Two weeks in and we've lost half of our livestock. If the creature is this big, I imagine it eats quite a bit.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And how long of a ride is it? Is it walking distance?","response":"DM: “To… where?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA, LIAM, and SAM: To your farm.","response":"DM: “North side of Emon.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, so real close!","response":"DM: “Yes.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We are friends of the elderly, obviously, and also of the farming community, so we are very interested in helping you. May we talk about it a bit before we decide how and when we would tackle this problem?","response":"DM: They look at each other and nod and he taps her hand and says, “Yes. By all means– If you could, please help us stop this beast from ruining our livelihood.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And can you please tell us how to get to your place. Do you normally stay there? Are you normally home?","response":"DM: “We wander about the community, but we do have a homestead. If you look, it's the large red wood and partially brick-based homestead closest to the city walls, on the north farm. Right outside of Emon. It's hard to miss, if you're headed that direction.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Quickly. Presently, we will find you. Guys, we were told to sit and spin basically. I mean, what's wrong with earning some brownie points in the eyes of Uriel?\nTRAVIS: Mr. and Mrs. Kraut, as friends of the elderly–","response":"DM: “Klaus.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right, Kraut. Do they normally come at night, or have they ever abducted any of your sweet bulls during the day?","response":"DM: “We've not seen it during the day. It'd be easier for us to identify if we had. Seems to only hunt at night.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: And have they ever messed with a human?","response":"DM: “Not that we've heard of. Not yet.” He gives you this sudden look of realization and fear. And pats and comforts his wife who suddenly realizes, oh my. Are they going to take us now?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We'll probably be by like tonight or tomorrow morning.\nLIAM: Yes. Tomorrow morning at the latest. We have a little bit of business. Yeah.\nMARISHA: So we're in the middle of doing something. We'll get to it.\nLIAM: I take him by the hand and say, we will see you presently.\nSAM: Here. My business card.\nLIAM: And you can take that to the bank.\nLAURA: You can't actually; it's worth nothing.","response":"DM: “Well, thank you for listening to us ramble on, and we look forward to hearing from you in the next day.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You will.\nTRAVIS: Travel safe, Mr. Kraut!\nLIAM: Hide your bull; hide your wife.","response":"DM: They both wander off."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We are in danger of being ostracized. We should really be nice to everybody right now.\nSAM: We were just having a conversation about how we should try to be nice from now on. But we do have very pressing matters.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, let's get fucking in there and talk to that little–\nMARISHA: It's funny how that type of thing can come back to bite you in the ass.\nSAM: I call up to Cordell. Oi, Cordell!","response":"DM: “Yeah!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Remember when I told you not to let anyone linger outside the keep?","response":"DM: “To be fair, the Klauses are well-known in the community.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The Krauts?\nLAURA: The Klauses.","response":"DM: “They came here for business. I figured it was probably something you'd want to hear. I apologize.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: By all means, use your judgment over the orders of your master. That's fine.\nMARISHA: Scanlan!","response":"DM: Cordell bows his head sheepishly. “I apologize. I'm sorry.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ignore him!\nLAURA: We are here to help people! We're here to help.","response":"DM: He does his finger like this and the gates open in towards the inside of the keep wall."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And what is wrong with you all today?!\nSAM: We had a really bad dinner last night. That's all.\nLAURA: I head straight to the jail.\nMARISHA: I follow.","response":"DM: As you guys are doing that, Tiberius, what's the first thing you're trying to do?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Stop by and pick up the decanter from the temple.","response":"DM: Okay. He said it required two days. It's been less than a day since you dropped it off, just so you're aware."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Then the only thing I do is visit the keep with the sigils library or whatever.","response":"DM: Oh, the Lyceum? Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm not going. I'm just going to go hang out up on the wall outside the keep.\nORION: The sigil that's closest to the Feywild.","response":"DM: Okay. In researching what they have at their disposal, you understand that the Feywild itself, because it is a separate plane, the magics to traverse it are a little more difficult to do. If you notice– and I'll confirm here just to be sure that we're on the same page– before I go full on this here. Pardon me, just a moment while I scan through the book. The mighty book. The book of might. Yes. Sigils of teleportation require the same plane of existence, meaning you can teleport anywhere within the Prime Material Plane that you exist in. To traverse into the Feywild, you have to actually find a door into the Feywild, and then you would be able to use a sigil from the Feywild."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Then I only pick up my decanter.","response":"DM: Which is not ready yet."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I don't do that! Damn, I forgot! My short-term memory is just jacked!","response":"DM: It's all good. It's all good."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You know, somebody's been to the Feywild.","response":"DM: Yeah. The Feywild. What you do find is that the Feywild– the boundaries between this realm and the Feywild tend to grow weaker at full moons. It's tied to the moon cycle. And at certain places where nature is set to run wild. A lot of druidic tribes tend to mark these locations, and in some cases actually guard them."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We know where a hole in one is. Grog went through it.","response":"DM: And if you recall– good memory– in the Frostweald, the partially frozen forest where you had that conversation with the nymph– that portal that she existed through was specifically a door into the Feywild, which you recognized."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What city was that near?","response":"DM: That was south of Westruun."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Then I'll go to the thing and I'll find the Westruun sigil.","response":"DM: Okay. Through your research, you do find a sigil to Westruun. This is allowing you to go into this portion for this sigil because you've already used the favor that you had to get the sigil of Kraghammer."}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, I didn't. I used the amulet and we got permission to come there. I saved that favor for this.","response":"DM: Right, the favor for Gilmore. All I'm saying is, you've used one of two favors to get that sigil. You have to invoke Gilmore's favor to get this one. Okay. And since you're a part of the circumstance, you acquire the secondary sigil. You now know, in your memory permanently, a sigil to Westruun. You don't know where in Westruun, but you are connected there. If you choose to teleport there, you know how to. That favor has now been used by Gilmore, so you can mark that. And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a five minute rest break. So yeah, restroom, snacks, drinks and we'll be back here in about five or so minutes. We'll see you guys and continue this tense adventure."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 50? Come on!","response":"DM: If we can get there, that'd be awesome! We'll have our giveaway– the signed cast Critical Role photo and the cast signed art poster by Kit Buss."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Kit Buss, ladies and gentlemen!","response":"DM: Yeah! So you have all returned to the keep. You have found yourselves down to the basement area. You hear the distant pinging of metal, an occasional squeaking metallic noise. Like something is being altered, turned, or quenched in a water trough. Like the process of blacksmithing."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I go to the edge of the door and knock.","response":"DM: As you knock on the metal door, it's like a (boom). The pinging stops. Just hangs for a second."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Percy? It's Keyleth.","response":"DM: “Not right now. Please. I'm sorry. I just need to clear my head.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. We'll be here.","response":"DM: A moment later, you see Percy's eyes appear at the edge of the door."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hi!","response":"DM: Just looking at them, you can see they look a little sunken, a little weary."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Did you sleep?","response":"DM: “Not as much as I'd like.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do you need anything?\nMARISHA: We went and saw Uriel. Everyone in the city hates us. They think we're all criminals.","response":"DM: “Great. I have to get back to my work.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, yeah.","response":"DM: The slit shuts."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, we'll see you later, then.","response":"DM: You guys, however, walk down to the other side of the cell. The cell door's been closed. The keys are hanging on the nail by it. You have not used the cell until this point. It's technically pristine and unused since the construction of the keep, but the keys still hang on the key ring. On the inside of it, there is no thatch. Nothing has been put in to really make a comfortable floor. And hanging from manacles–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's hanging?!\nSAM: We're the worst.","response":"DM: He was put in as a prisoner."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I go and get the keys, and I take him down from the manacles.","response":"DM: As she rushes into the cell, begins unlocking the manacles. He's unconscious at this time. Dirt streaked on his face and spatters of dried blood from the blast of the gun."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I go ahead and I administer Cure Wounds.","response":"DM: The wound at this point has been cauterized. You cast Cure Wounds as he starts to come to consciousness, in a heap on the ground. (coughs) It appears he may be healed of any damage he may still be sustaining from that, but the fingers are gone. This is beyond the magic you're capable of. He comes to consciousness on the ground, dirtied, sore. Essentially broken before you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does he look like he's been bitten at all?","response":"DM: You want to inspect?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I look at his neck?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 20.","response":"DM: Okay. You don't have a whole lot of medicinal experience, but you take a moment and inspect both sides of his neck, tilting his head side-to-side, as he's groaning and coming to. “What's going on?” Looking at the sides of his neck, there does not appear to be any sign of any puncture wounds, anything that would be reminiscent of what your brother currently is healing from."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do an insight check to see if he is also under a mind-control spell?","response":"DM: At the moment, no. He is barely coming to consciousness. There isn't enough of a presence at the moment to really read past."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hey, there. Welcome back.","response":"DM: “Where am I?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You are being held, at the moment, for your own safety.","response":"DM: “For my own safety?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: “How?” He looks at his hand."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, you were captured. We're pretty sure the Briarwoods are going to be pissed as hell that you let the carriage get hit. We're just trying to protect you, really.\nMARISHA: Really?\nSAM: I mean, his friends all died, so.\nMARISHA: Do we not feel like terrible people enough already?\nSAM: Let's not have this conversation in front of the prisoner. What's your name, boy!","response":"DM: “My name is Desmond. Desmond Otham. I am the son of a messenger, a courier of the de Rolo family.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He's the son of a messenger! That's even more ironic!\nLAURA: Keyleth, do you need to step outside?\nMARISHA: No, I'm good. Continue. Son of a messenger.\nLAURA: Right now, everyone is at risk. The Briarwoods are bad people, you can attest to this, yes?","response":"DM: “Yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes. Can you tell us everything you know about them?","response":"DM: “It's not going to matter. They're going to find me. No one's supposed to get away.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You did!\nTRAVIS: There's always a first time.","response":"DM: “I don't even know where to begin.” He adjusts himself, sliding back, putting his back against the wall of the cell."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I reach into the Bag of Holding. I pull out the little goblet, and I pour some ale into a cup, and I hand him a little bit of ale. No, it's fine. I take a little sip.","response":"DM: “Please don't take offense if I don't trust a drink from strangers who've, well, to be honest, put me in this position.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We want to know if the Briarwoods–\nSAM: Are vampires.\nLAURA: Pretty much. They're vampires, right? I mean, they're vampires.","response":"DM: “All I know from the stories I've heard. Mothers would tell their kids not to wander out at night because dark things crawl in the shadows. From what I know of vampires, they're not supposed to go out during the day, right? But I'm sure I've seen Lady Briarwood walk in the sun many a time.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Only Lady Briarwood?","response":"DM: “As I recall, yes. Lord Briarwood doesn't make too many public appearances.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Have there been any strange goings-on in their residence? Sounds you've heard? People disappearing? Boxes coming in or out?\nLAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on him. I know Cure Wounds, bitches! Level up!\nORION: Have I reached the keep yet?","response":"DM: No, not yet. You're probably about an hour away, at this point. From the time you've taken to research, find this, learn the sigil to Westruun, and begin your trek back. Fortunately, you got what you wanted, but you're out of the picture for a little bit. He flinches as you put your hand up, and as you touch him, he exhales. You get to him just as he can react, briefly."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 11. Do I add anything to that?","response":"DM: I believe you add your Wisdom modifier to that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 14.","response":"DM: He goes, “Look, my father worked for the de Rolo family before the Briarwoods came. My father vanished the night of their fall. My mother was taken in madness and lost to the night this past year. I was left alone. However, I knew the roads well between here and Whitestone and places between, growing up, traveling with my father. So I was made to be a coachman for the new nobles. I was paid, albeit little, and I was left alone. Now, when I say the new nobles, there were nobles that lived in Whitestone and worked along with the de Rolos, and they helped oversee parts of the town, the business, and the people. They had been there for many generations of their respective families, all under the de Rolos' guidance. But the night the castle fell, those nobles were dragged out. It's strange. I mean, after the brutality of that first night, it took days before the people of Whitestone knew what had happened. We saw the fires, we heard the battles, but no word of the victors until three days had passed. We were too scared to approach. By then, the Briarwoods called a town meeting. They explained their new rule over the town. A number objected, which is expected. Many strong-willed folk in Whitestone, those days. They were subsequently shot down at arrow-point. The rest were quiet. They then dragged out the noble families and executed them, gifting their property and titles to the various cut-throats and mercenaries they had hired, brought across the channel to help them take the town. They're not just two people; they've used a lot of money and influence from wherever they came from and brought a whole slew of very dastardly folk, who have since been given the titles once held by the other nobles of Whitestone, living in their homes, taking their tithes and most of the profits made from the businesses they've forced us to continue to run from within the city. A number of families fled into the woods the night after the executions, using the shadows of a moonless evening to keep safe. They were all found hanging from the Sun Tree the next morning. They kept things going as they were, mostly: farming, logging, manning the white marble mines. Business went as usual, all filling the pockets of the new nobles and the Briarwoods. We were given food, kept our immediate property. As long as we didn't attempt to leave, we were promised safety. That lasted for a few years, until the nobles grew bored. Twitchy. They began to abuse the people of Whitestone: scare us for fun, brand, cut, steal the children, leave them back, destroyed. They treat us like animals. Folks went missing. I was beaten so bad by my employer, Count Tylieri. But Lord Briarwood noticed, one night he was passing through the city. He saw wounds on my back when he was meeting with Count Tylieri. When he asked me in private how I got them, I couldn't lie. Couldn't resist him. He has a way of drawing the truth out of you. Now, he told me this unrefined violence was boorish to him and his wife. That was the last I ever saw of Lord Tylieri. Lord and Lady Briarwood took me in as their own driver and showed me Tylieri hanging from that same Sun Tree the next morning. I was thankful, then. In a strange way, life had been so terrible for so long, it was the first time I saw someone reach out and save me. They took me in as their driver after that. It was a better thing to be away from the anger and the fists of the thugs. But the more I got to know the Briarwoods, the more nightmarish I realized they were. Behind the walls of that castle was no longer a grand fortress that we heard it was. Seeing it, keeping watch and guard over our people. No, that was a domain of perverse magics and sacrilege, it was. The green fog drifting out from the ground where it stood. The same servants still run the halls, but they aren't living.  They're walking vessels of undeath, their flesh slowly tearing away. The garden in back lies shriveled, a foul green mist forever pouring out. They're excavating something in the dungeon, plundering pieces. A lot of their attention seems to be down there; I don't know why. I dare not wander too far down. They bring up old things. Ancient things. Relics, books, bones. You live in that world long enough, you believe there is no way out. Death would be easy, though I've seen that death is no real end there. It's just the beginning of a whole new terrible existence. A far worse fate.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: If we keep you here, protected, would you be willing to tell your story to someone else?","response":"DM: “Who would you want me to tell it to?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The emperor. The guards here. An army that could go and fight the Briarwoods.","response":"DM: “Maybe.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: This could be an option to save Whitestone, and you would have your freedom.","response":"DM: “I don't know. You don't know what it's like. You don't know what they've done. They're going to find me.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We can protect you. We are safe here in this keep, and you're surrounded by very powerful allies now.\nTRAVIS: We've stood before them, and we did not fall.\nLAURA: It's true.","response":"DM: “I'll think about it.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Would you like to stay in the guest room upstairs? You'd be more comfortable. You could get a good night's rest.\nLAURA: Far more comfortable. A little less safe. I'm going to put it out there.","response":"DM: That resonates with him immediately, and his eyes flash open. “I mean no disrespect, but if this is safe, then I'd rather stay here.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think it is. And we will bring a bed down to you, make sure you're comfortable. I don't want you sleeping on the floor. That's terrible.","response":"DM: “You're all being very accommodating.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You'll get every consideration for protection. We value your info very much.\nMARISHA: You're also the key to our own freedom, so it's important.\nSAM: You also caught us on a day where we're trying to be nicer to people.\nSAM: Lucky for you.\nLIAM: Just be glad you're not an old woman.","response":"DM: “I'll stay here for now.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: From the Briarwoods?","response":"DM: “From a few. And they're dead. An enemy of an enemy doesn't necessarily make them a friend, I've discovered.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, but it can make them allies if they have mutual enemies. Of their enemies. It's a little complicated.","response":"DM: This whole conversation, the emotional recalling of everything, you can see has been very taxing on him and his still mostly conscious state. He looks exhausted, scared, and still trying to suss out all the information coming at him right now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Grog, why don't you carry the bed down from upstairs?\nTRAVIS: Not a problem. Keep the goblet nearby. It is very nice ale.\nMARISHA: Would you like something to eat?","response":"DM: “Yes, please.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We'll have our staff bring down some food.","response":"DM: He takes the goblet. He looks at it, smells it, but still holds it at bay as you walk off. You eventually go– easy enough for you– take the bed. You have to turn it to the side to take it out, which causes all of the cushions to fall out."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Aw, shit.\nTRAVIS: I grab a little pillow with my toes, and I hobble down.","response":"DM: It takes about 20 minutes and three trips, but you manage to get the bed down there from the guest room."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Not a problem.","response":"DM: When you fit it in the cell– and it's not a large cell; it's maybe ten by ten feet maximum. You place it there. As you guys walk back, you notice as you see Grog walking back down the stairway– right around the corner as you go down the steps, the hallway goes to the cell, and it turns to the right and to the left to the workshop. You see around the corner a shoulder, listening in. There's a person. And you recognize that it is Percy. Percy has stepped out of the workshop and apparently has been hearing everything this entire time."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Give him time.\nSAM: So moody!\nLAURA: So yeah, I'm going to lock it. I'm just going to lock your door. To make sure you're safe, make sure nobody can get in.","response":"DM: “Keep him away from me. Who is that?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: He's a friend. I know it doesn't seem like it from the condition of your paw, but he's a friend. He's in the same boat as you, trying to stay safe from danger.\nLAURA: The Briarwoods destroyed his family, as well.","response":"DM: And you see now, there's like this look of tension on his face that's mixed with tired. And eventually finding the bed and takes the goblet– still filled, has not drunk from it– just slips it next to the side of the bed. Eventually food is brought down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And a chamber pot, because come on!","response":"DM: All the basic pleasantries are brought within the cell. He lies on the bed and takes the plate up with him and starts just scarfing some of the bread rolls down. And immediately starts going for the mashed potatoes. You can see a decent meal hasn't been had in quite a while. Especially the journey, what is essentially a seven to eight day journey from Whitestone, probably has not been very kind to him. Eats and then promptly passes out on the bed. Food still mashed on the side of the face. Just goes straight into a slumber."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is there any other entrance to the cell area besides the door? No barred windows or anything like that?","response":"DM: No. It's underground. It's all solid, solid stone walls. And there is the barred front door, and then just goes right into the hallway that goes up the stairs to your left and across the way and around the corner to the workshop."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You can't cast any kind of alarm system? A trigger?\nLAURA: So that Percy can't get anything through there?\nMARISHA: Let me reference my spell tome. It's not a common one. It's situational. But let me check real quick. I haven't read that chapter from my book in a while.\nORION: Is Allura on the way back from the Lyceum?","response":"DM: No, the Lyceum is in the Erudite District. Allura's tower is in the Cloudtop, which is the central part of Emon."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I do want to go check out that bird creature at the farmhouse tonight.\nSAM: Yes. Well, have we stationed a guard down there?\nTRAVIS: We should. We have five or six.\nTRAVIS: No, not Cordell. Let's get somebody else.\nLAURA: Get the crossbow guy that we like so much. The guy that's the captain of the guards.\nSAM: Is that Kendrick? Or Shayne? Oh, the girl?\nLAURA: No, the guy. He's awesome and he's an archer, as well.\nSAM: Jarett?\nLAURA: Jarett. That's it!","response":"DM: You make your way to the back part of the wall, and there is a small tower that's constructed as part of the back wall. That's where Jarett usually keeps watch. Jarett has the in-between shift between the guards, so he can be present for both sides and keep a watch during the afternoon until the nighttime. Probably till about midnight or so. So as you make your way out of the keep, Tiberius, are you heading back to the keep or are you heading toward the Cloudtop District? This will dictate whether or not you show up around this time."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to Allura's.\nLAURA: I'm staying down in the prison, just for the time being. I don't want to leave him alone with Percy.","response":"DM: You go to find Jarett, who's up at the top of the tower. And as you call to him, Jarett leans over. And you see him, you know, short jet-black hair, darker complexion. Very handsome, younger, early-twenties guy. Well-dressed over his studded leather armor that he wears underneath and has the crossbow on the side. He leans over. “Scanlan, it has been some time. It is so good to hear from you. What can I be of service for?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We need you to watch a prisoner for us, downstairs in our jail cell, which we had built and are now using. You'll be guarding the prisoner to make sure he doesn't escape, but also making sure he stays safe. He possesses information that's very valuable to us. And one of the people who hires you might try to kill him, so if Percy tries to go in there, can you stop him without hurting either party?","response":"DM: “I imagine this would be very well-suited for my skill set. It will be strange to keep watch against one of my employers, but he's been a bit sheepish around me anyway.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You think you could take Percy?","response":"DM: “Well, I think I can at least talk some sense into him!”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I like him!\nSAM: Wow! Jarett, you're ballsy! Just out of curiosity, if he was running at you, what would you do?","response":"DM: “Well, first and foremost, I would dive in the forward motion, leg out, to put him off balance. This would be from a frontal melee– you're messing with me, aren't you?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: A little bit!","response":"DM: “Ah, gnomes! Very well.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do you need anything to help?","response":"DM: “I have access to my own private armory, and I have utmost faith.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Pathetic!\nSAM: I don't know! Ten! Ten gold!","response":"DM: “Gnomes.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't know how money works. We'll talk to Vex about it.\nLIAM: I wasn't there for any of that. I was upstairs on the roof, just thinking.","response":"DM: Tiberius, you make your way into the Cloudtop District. As you come to the front gates of the district, the guards that normally recognize you and welcome you in, recognize you and stand firm, weapons at the ready."}
{"prompt":"ORION: At Allura's tower?","response":"DM: At the Cloudtop District entirely. You guys had to get written permission to enter there when you first came to Emon, anyway, since that's where the nobility and many of the important figures of Emon reside. It appears that since you've been taken out of the Council and you're under investigation, your access to such a sensitive location within Emon has been temporarily revoked, and the guards are not letting you through."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Is that it? So I just turn around? Go back?","response":"DM: It's up to you. The guards are just there, standing."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Greeting and salutations. I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia. Moreover, a member of Vox Machina, over at Greyskull Keep. It seems that you all are posturing and whatnot. (chuckles) It's adorable. But I'm here to see Lady Allura. Could you let her know that I would like to speak to her, or get out of my way so I can just go over there and tell her myself?","response":"DM: “We have direct orders to not let you or any other member of Vox Machina into the Cloudtop District until your investigation is complete. So no, and no.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, do the second thing. If you don't do one thing, do one of the other things.","response":"DM: “Your information and wish has been processed, taken into consideration. Thank you very much. Please be on your way.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, it has been, it has been processed! Oh, that's good to know! I appreciate that. Very well. I cast Fly on myself and I go back to the keep.\nLIAM: I hide behind– I don't want to get hit, so I'm going to crouch down a little bit, carefully behind one of the pieces of wall. Yeah. Rough landings, sometimes.\nORION: I fly in. Vox Machina!\nLIAM: Easy. Be careful.\nORION: Sorry. Hi. What are you doing? Are you up here thinking?\nLIAM: Why, I suppose I was. The others are downstairs interrogating that boy. Where have you been?\nORION: Off doing things that wasn't really that productive, overall, but they don't like me anywhere, especially now.\nLIAM: Do you want to have a drink?\nORION: Yes, actually, I do.\nLIAM: I've got a flask. You normally drink water. You want a shot, though?\nORION: Yes, I would love some alcohol. This calls for alcohol.\nLIAM: I pull out my flask, and I'm amazed, because I've never seen this and I hand it over to him.\nORION: Oh yes. (whoosh)\nSAM: Did you eat the flask?\nORION: No, fire breath.\nLIAM: Do you want to pass that bad boy back? Is it hot?","response":"DM: It's empty."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, it's empty! Well, I guess that was worth it.\nORION: (slurred) What? What are you talking about? Don't you tell me how to drink. Oh, you!\nTRAVIS: I come out from the castle into the courtyard, and I go, hey! I feel like chicken tonight! Can we go hunt this big bird?\nLIAM: Tiberius– I just got him drunk!\nTRAVIS: Really?\nORION: (slurred) He gave me a shot of his flask water, and it's so good.\nTRAVIS: Are you sure you didn't hit him with the blunt side of your knife again?\nLIAM: No, no, he took a shot of the old firewater, and I don't know. We might want to slap him a bit–\nORION: (slurred) Allura doesn't like me anymore because I killed that bitch who tried to kill us, and now she's fucking– nobody likes us!\nLIAM: Let's find Keyleth.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Smart. Keyleth!\nMARISHA: What? I was reading. What?\nTRAVIS: Tibs got turnt up. Will you fix it?\nMARISHA: How?\nORION: Vax gave me–\nMARISHA: What did you do? Why are you touching me?\nORION: Oh, I love protecting you, it is– and Lockheed is, he loves you, too–\nMARISHA: Don't touch me right now!\nORION: See, I'm telling you, nobody likes me.\nLIAM: I gave him his first drinky. I'm sorry. Do you think you could pull him out of it?\nMARISHA: What?\nLIAM: I thought he was going to say no! He didn't leave me any.\nORION: It's good. Hi. How are you? I'm Tiberius– Draconia. You are princess pretty face. He likes you, too.\nLIAM: Vax walks away, off the roof. Out of here. I'm gone!\nTRAVIS: Grog is riveted.\nORION: Human kissy mouth, with you is– (vomits)\nORION: I'm good.\nMARISHA: If you touch me one more time!\nORION: Oh! Sorry. Did you need to go somewhere?\nMARISHA: I am doing something else, a request that was already made previously, before “can we fix drunk Tiberius,” so I'm a little busy! Why don't you go sleep it off, take a nap, and I will deal with you in a second.\nORION: Is it sleepy time?\nMARISHA: For you.\nORION: Should I cast Fireball?\nMARISHA: Oh my god. And I shove him into the cell and put him in bed–\nTRAVIS: No, we're not in the prison. We're out in the courtyard.\nMARISHA: Oh, I thought that you said– everyone was like, Keyleth!\nLAURA: I'm still in the prison. Everybody else is out of the prison.","response":"DM: So where do you push him?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: She pushed me off the roof.\nMARISHA: No! I thought we were downstairs.\nORION: I fall off the roof. I still have Fly on myself, don't I?\nMARISHA: You don't fall off the roof. I don't know what I do with him. I let him pass out.\nORION: I'm going to get a sandwich.\nMARISHA: I let him go get a sandwich.\nSAM: I encourage sandwich!","response":"DM: That's the quote of the night. Encouraged to get a sandwich, Tiberius wanders off. What are you doing to prepare what you were doing?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't know! I got distracted!\nORION: I'm not there.\nMARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: Well, as the day progresses, what would you guys like to do?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait. My idea. Okay. We were wanting extra fortification? We were wanting extra protection. Okay? I can't necessarily cast a big spell. I could cast Hallucinatory Terrain. We have a few options; I'm giving them to you all. I can cast Hallucinatory Terrain to make this look like something else. I don't think– I don't know. I don't know if that's a good idea. I don't know. I could conjure a few woodland beings for, like, extra bears. We could have some bears guarding the palace. I could also throw up a Wall of Thorns, to barrier the cell with the wall of thorns. You're not here?\nSAM: I think everyone left. I think it's just you and me up here, and drunk Tiberius.\nMARISHA: I went downstairs, and I'm saying this to the group so I don't have to repeat myself!\nORION: Oh, so then I turn around with my sandwich and am like, we have to just make Allura talk to us. She can fix everything.\nTRAVIS: I grab Tiberius's mouth and I cover it. Please continue.\nSAM: Wall of Thorns could be good.\nLAURA: I like Wall of Thorns.\nMARISHA: The thing with Wall of Thorns is it's not super big. It's 60 feet.\nSAM: That's pretty big!\nLAURA: Oh. That's not the whole place, though.\nSAM: Oh, 60 feet long. I thought you meant high.\nMARISHA: No, it's 100 feet high. It's really high. Actually, I don't know how high it is. Don't quote me on that. But it's not that long, but we could fortify the doors more. Have bears. We could do multiple things, too.\nLIAM: I think that the Hallucinatory Terrain wouldn't work. I felt like they could see right through me.\nTRAVIS: I think so, too.\nMARISHA: On the Briarwoods?\nLAURA: Yeah, they can see through illusions pretty darn well.\nSAM: Listen, Percy's here. He can defend for us.\nORION: No, you need a warding spell.\nSAM: Why don't we just leave someone behind?\nMARISHA: Percy's behind.\nTRAVIS: Percy's here and so are five? Six? How many employees do we have?\nLAURA: Our very capable guards.\nTRAVIS: Why don't you make some extra bears that don't hate us?\nMARISHA: Huh?\nTRAVIS: Why don't you make some extra bears that don't hate us?\nORION: Put some little hats on them and make them cute.\nLIAM: Do you think you could fix him? Because he's a lot of firepower if we're going to go–\nLAURA: Maybe Restoration?","response":"DM: Restoration would probably take care of it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't want to burn a Restoration spell on your drunkenness.\nLAURA: Can you cast little Restoration?","response":"DM: You could also just give it a couple of hours. Drink a lot of water."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What time is it?","response":"DM: At this point, it's probably close to 3:00 in the afternoon."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So it's 3:00 in the afternoon. The bird doesn't even come until night. We could let him wear it off.\nMARISHA: What time is it?\nSAM: 3:00. We just established this. We're going to wait until night and go.\nLAURA: She said she hated you. How did that feel?\nLIAM: Fine. That was fine. That was the heat of the moment. She was angry. We're a team.\nSAM: The plan is we're going to let him sober up. We're going to give him some coffee. And then we're going to set off for the north farmlands at dusk.\nORION: Oh, we should get some corn and other harvestments at the farms.\nMARISHA: I make an army of bears.","response":"DM:  Okay. This concentration will last an hour."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! That's it.","response":"DM: The Conjure Woodland Beings?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait! No! Hang on. What if I conjure a bear, and then– let me make sure, while they figure their stuff out. See, we're all figuring stuff out?\nLAURA: What if I leave Trinket in the prison with Jarett?\nTRAVIS: Yeah! That won't freak him out at all.\nSAM: Well, with Cordell. Jarett's down in the cell. This is defense against invading vampires.\nMARISHA: Okay! I have a better idea!\nTRAVIS: Yep?\nSAM: Oh my god.\nMARISHA: Why don't I conjure an elemental, and then I can cast Planar Binding on him and he'll hang out for 24 hours.\nSAM: Great! Do it. Make it done. Let's go kill a bird.\nTRAVIS: Lead with that next time.\nMARISHA: I was figuring it out. It's new.\nSAM: You've got to talk it through.\nMARISHA: Figuring it out.\nTRAVIS: That's awesome!","response":"DM: Yep! That'll do."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Don't vampires hate fire? Can you do fire?\nLAURA: Yeah, fire! Fire elemental!\nLIAM: Running water.\nLAURA: Ooh, water elemental! (gasps) Tiberius, remember that you–\nTRAVIS: He's drunk!\nLAURA: I know.\nSAM: Don't talk to him.\nTRAVIS: He won't remember anything.\nORION: (slurred) I love how you shoot arrows at things' eyeballs.\nSAM: I use Minor Illusion to create Lockheed, and I have him scamper away.\nORION: Oh, that's you. But where are you going? You go play up there. Tell your brother to be good.\nAnyway, you're so pretty.","response":"DM: So are you doing that, Marisha? Keyleth, are you summoning an elemental?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes.","response":"DM: Okay. Which kind?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Water elemental.","response":"DM: Okay. And you cast Planar Binding. Part of the material component cost is a gem that's worth at least 1,000 gold pieces."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I have one of those.\nLAURA: You do?\nTRAVIS: Yeah. It's a jewel that's red and palm-sized.\nLAURA: I have a diamond of awesome. And a regular diamond, as well.\nLIAM: If I create a trap here, can you bind some magic to it?\nORION: You can do anything with magic. You can make things go. You can make things stop.\nTRAVIS: I cover Tiberius's mouth again.\nLAURA: I give her a diamond.\nLAURA: This is a regular diamond. The awesome diamond is special.\nLAURA: No! Don't do that!\nMARISHA: I know! Why do you do that?\nLAURA: Diamonds are really expensive! Any diamonds!\nMARISHA: I know! And an awesome diamond has got to be more than 1,000, so this time there's got to be at least 1,000. Grog, what kind of jewel do you have?\nTRAVIS: It's a palm-sized ruby.\nMARISHA: A palm-sized ruby?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I got a big palm!\nMARISHA: Tiberius.\nSAM: No, just don't.","response":"DM: Vex. Your keen eye is able to ascertain that the palm-sized ruby is worth roughly 1,200 gold pieces and would be suitable for this ritual."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think we should use the ruby. Because I have an eye for these things.\nTRAVIS: Do we think they're going to come while we do this? Do we want to waste it? Because that's an awesome outside defense. Do we want to waste it for this? What if they're coming? Does it cost one jewel per–","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Maybe we should save that, because that's awesome!\nLIAM: Is there a possibility, DM, that I could– if he's sobered up– if I set a trap, that a spell of his could be bound to it, somehow, and go off? I have no idea.","response":"DM: It's hard to say. There are certain spells that can enable that. That can take certain spells that trigger at a certain time. Nothing that's particularly in your guys' realm of experience or understanding though, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Keyleth, I like that. I think we should keep it in case there is an actual attack coming. Because it might just, 24 hours and then we waste it. Nobody came.\nMARISHA: That's true. To be fair, the castle's being heavily watched by outsiders, as well.\nSAM: Okay! Listen. Let's just go.\nORION: Grog is big. Scanlan's small. Everything is great. Hi.\nLIAM: Can we leave Trinket? To watch.\nLAURA: What? He's going to go down in the prison with Jarett.","response":"DM: Okay. You bring Trinket down. Trinket stands watch right in the center, plops down right up against the bars."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I knock on Percy's door and say, Percy?","response":"DM: “Yes?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket's out here. If you need anything, you just come out and you pet him.","response":"DM: “Thank you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Welcome.\nORION: I also go up to the door and go, Trinket. (mumbling) Percy.\nLAURA: Aren't you sober yet?\nORION: No, it's been like five minutes, hasn't it?","response":"DM: Yeah. Over time, over the next two to three hours or so, you guys have set up a place to go. They have given you some water, and you've managed to sober up a bit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I actually picked his pocket and took his bottle of endless water. Don't you have a bottle of water like that?","response":"DM: No. That is currently left to be blessed for holy water."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh. Oh, well.\nTRAVIS: And we take the scenic route to let him walk it off as we head up towards Big Bird's house.\nSAM: Great!\nSAM: We're here to help. We're the heroes that you asked for.\nTRAVIS: We love old people.","response":"DM: “Thank you. That's really good of you. We will happily provide you with fresh produce, going forward. We've talked to a few of the members of the community and we're going to make sure that's taken care of.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Where do you think we should stake out this bird? Where are your livestock kept?","response":"DM: “The livestock are kept on the eastern side of this community. If you look about, say about half a mile out to where the actual residences stop being clustered together, you'll see there are a number of large livestock containment areas. Hard to miss out there. We have pens for sheep; we have pens for cows; we have pens for horses, other beasts of burden. That whole vicinity is where most of these attacks seem to be coming. So that's probably your best bet there.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And the biggest you have are the bulls, you said?","response":"DM: “Bulls. We have a few big cows, as well. We've lost a few of them, unfortunately.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That'll be all we need.\nLAURA: Can one of us polymorph into a giant cow?\nSAM: Sure.\nMARISHA: I could also talk to cows again. Maybe these cows will know something.\nTRAVIS: We head out to the pasture.\nMARISHA: First can I ask her, you said your neighbor boy, Kyle?\nSAM: Kyle. The neighbor boy. The neighbor boy's son. Yes.","response":"DM: “That's true. Kyle's the one who originally spotted it, yeah.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Where does he live?","response":"DM: “He's actually the son of the man who runs most of the livestock areas over there. You can go and head over there. He's probably still up, keeping his eye out in case it comes back.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thank you. I go to Kyle.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys make your way over there. It's easy to find. There's large pens. You can see that for as big as the pens are built and their structure, they are noticeably dwindled. You can see why there's been some worry in the community here. The fact that it's only been two weeks and this many creatures are gone is a little disconcerting. As you get there, you can see the house has its light on. There are glowing windows. And sitting in a chair, holding a crossbow across his lap, you see a 19-year-old boy, rugged chin growth, dirty red hair that's disheveled. And he's sitting there looking around in the sky. Rocking back and forth in his chair as you approach. “Who goes there?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Don't worry, we're friends. We're friends of the Klauses. Mr. and Mrs. Klaus.","response":"DM: “Okay. Okay. So you the ones they say was coming to help?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes.\nTRAVIS: Aye.\nLAURA: We hear you have a keen eye, Kyle.","response":"DM: “I've seen some things, yeah.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Where have they been attacking lately?","response":"DM: Points to the whole area in front of him and says, “Are you keeping watch now? Great. Thank you.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No! Wait! Don't leave yet. We need you.\nORION: Yes, yes. Keyleth. We are Vox Machina. Over from Greyskull Keep. I'm Tiberius Stormwind.\nMARISHA: That's irrelevant. The point is, I was wondering if you had any more information about the creature.","response":"DM: “I mean, other than the fact that it was just a really big bird. Really big. Huge.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do you remember any other details? Any other defining details other than “bird?”","response":"DM: “It's hard to see in the moonlight.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: When it picks up a cow or whatever it's been picking up, does it strike with the beak or the claws? The talons.","response":"DM: “Claws, and sometimes it takes two at a time, one in each claw, and just carries them away. ”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Have you seen any of its droppings anywhere?","response":"DM: “No. ”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Have you managed to hit it with your crossbow?","response":"DM: “I've missed.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And you're certain this is a feathered beast, or no?","response":"DM: “Best I can see. It's dark out here at that time of night and it looks like a bird. It doesn't make any noise and swoops on down and takes them away and flies off in that direction.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I've heard that those giant birds are attracted to red-headed, 19-year-old, scruffy-chin folk with crossbows.","response":"DM: Make an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Awesome.","response":"DM: This would be with your charisma."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 22.","response":"DM: Nice. He goes, “Well, I don't want to be here, then. You guys can keep an eye out. I've got to go.” And unloads the bolt in the crossbow, slings it up under his arm–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait! Before you leave. I'm sorry. I have an itch. And it can only be scratched with a cowbell. Do you have a cowbell anywhere around here? I just need a cowbell. Can I borrow a cowbell from you?","response":"DM: “Your kid's weird.” And he keeps walking."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Your kid is weird!\nSAM: I'm not a child!\nLAURA: Do I see any cowbells on the ground?","response":"DM: You can take a glance about. You eventually can see that there is set up on one of the fences that fences in the cows, there is a cowbell, yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hey, there's a cowbell, Scanlan.\nSAM: Great. It will help the ruse. Here's my plan: we're all cows. Is that an okay plan?\nLAURA: I like it!\nMARISHA: I'm into this plan. But doesn't that essentially make us the bait?\nSAM: Yes, we're our own bait. Are you cool with that?\nLAURA: Should one of us maybe not be a cow?\nMARISHA: Well, here's the thing, maybe a few of us should not be cows because only a few people are going to have the ability to turn out of being a cow once they are a cow, unless they take damage.\nTRAVIS: We went from all cows to pretty much no one is a cow.\nLAURA: No, Keyleth is definitely a cow. No, I mean– I didn't– we didn't mean like that. You're very lovely.\nMARISHA: It's okay. What Vax said was way worse, earlier.\nTRAVIS: How do you come out of being a cow, if you are one?\nSAM: I can get rid of it.\nTRAVIS: You would do it? Let's do it! When else are we all going to be cows? Come on! Unless it kills them instantly, we'll be fine.\nORION: I'm fine. I go invisible.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to lay in wait with an arrow. All the rest of you can be cows.\nLIAM: I think I'm better served waiting to strike.\nSAM: You and me, Grog. We're cows!\nLIAM: If it grabs one of them, I'll deal more damage. If it grabs me, I'll deal no damage. But if it grabs Scanlan cow, I can–\nMARISHA: Another thing is, I can turn into a cow. I can turn someone else into a cow. Well, Polymorph is a concentration spell.\nSAM: I can turn us all into cows.\nMARISHA: Oh. Because you got that thing.\nTRAVIS: Cow or no, Keyleth? Give us your answer.\nMARISHA: Oh, I'm a cow.\nSAM: Seeming.\nORION: Oh, we are not actually cows?\nSAM: We'll just seem like cows.\nMARISHA: Except for me who is going to be an actual cow.\nORION: If it's Polymorph, I couldn't cast stuff. I redact my Invisibility and I'll be a cow. I'm also going to be a cow. I want to be a brown cow.\nMARISHA: We're all cows! Just embrace it.","response":"DM: You can't change a target's body type."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What? No.","response":"DM: So the same form of your limbs– you're right."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You can't change size, but we can all be Grog-sized cows or Scanlan-sized cows.","response":"DM: It's going to be an array of very strangely sized cows."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Scanlan would be like a calf. Big calf.\nSAM: What do you think?\nMATT and SAM: I'll allow it!\nSAM: Gather close to me!\nTRAVIS: We want to get in the pen first, right?\nSAM: Yes, let's go into the pen, and if I may, I'm going to wear the cow bell.\nTRAVIS: Sure! You've earned it.\nLAURA: How you going to put it? I'm just going to put it around your neck right now.\nTRAVIS: Super loose.","response":"DM: You guys make your way into the cow pen. The little bit of moonlight that's coming down from the sky illuminates. You see the cows are clustered underneath this overhang that is used for temporary shelter. You hear this distant (mooing) as you approach and make noise. No one's not too upset yet. It's more low muttering."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What if that was attraction?","response":"DM: Not yet."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: If we use Seeming, we just appear to be cows, but we can still speak, right?","response":"DM: Yeah. Anything sees you as cows–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Would be like, holy shit, those are talking cows!\nSAM: It's “cow-moo-flage.”\n(groaning)\nSAM: Thank you.\nORION: That's good.","response":"DM: I have to give you experience for that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wait. What's going on? Are we turning into cows?\nSAM: We just will seem like cows.\nLIAM: I don't understand magic.\nTRAVIS: Just go along. Go along.\nLAURA: That way we can ambush the bird.\nMARISHA: We are going to look like cows. Are we going to look like cows to each other, too?","response":"DM: You'll find out."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: As you all gather around the small gnome, currently adorned with the cowbell around his neck."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just like the brothels, eh?","response":"DM: You complete the spell and with a sudden (whoosh) of cold night air, your vision blurs and you blink for a second. You look around and Vox Machina is now, instead, an array of slightly smaller than average cows. (mooing)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (barks) Oh, wait. No.","response":"DM: You're, by the way, more of a calf."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You are so cute, Scanlan.\nMARISHA: Okay, shall we go interview some cows?\nLAURA: Let's go talk to some cows. I want to walk over to the cows with you.","response":"DM: You guys step up, awkwardly, towards the cows, some of which are sleeping, some of which are noticing and sitting there just chewing."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Which one looks like the alpha male?\nLAURA: The one that's got horns.","response":"DM: There are no males in this pen, because they are cows."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I try to speak to the cow.","response":"DM: Okay. What do you say?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Hello, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia.","response":"DM: You speak Common. You don't know Cow."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Tiberius, just because you look like a cow doesn't mean you can talk to the cows. The cows don't understand English. No matter if you look like a cow, they still don't understand Common.\nLIAM: Boy, if Uriel could see us now.\nTRAVIS: We are “cow-nsel” worthy.\nMARISHA: I cast Speak With Animals.\nMARISHA: Yes. Actually, how many animals can I hit with Speak with Animals? It is called Animals, right? Or is it just Speak with Animal?","response":"DM: I think it affects you. I think it gives you the ability to speak with."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, just me the ability?\nORION: You're Dr. Doolittle.\nMARISHA: Oh, yeah. I think you're right. Okay, so I cast Speak With Animals on myself.\nORION: Make sure the cow– What? She may know a cow that is over there.\nMARISHA: Okay, so I go up. Is there a cluster of nice-looking ladies, sitting around?","response":"DM: All the cows are clustered in this one corner, up against each other for body warmth. And there are few that are just like (moo)."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hello, ladies. Good evening.","response":"DM: (moo) Which is what you guys hear. You hear as a response: “What are you doing? We're trying to sleep.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I do apologize to awaken you. I was just curious if you could tell me a little bit about some of the events that have been transpiring around here lately? Mainly, the results of your kind getting killed?","response":"DM: “My kind?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Just ask about the bird!\nMARISHA: Have you seen a giant bird flying around? Anyone?","response":"DM: At which point, all the cows start shuddering and say, “Yes. Haven't you? It keeps taking us. Why do you think we're hiding under this?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, sure.","response":"DM: “Be careful. If you stay out there, it'll see you.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Right. Where, exactly? Where have they been– okay. Damn, cows! It's never–\nSAM: Keyleth, what vital information have you learned?\nMARISHA: I'll get back to you in one second. Can you tell me anything about what it looks like?","response":"DM: “It's big and has wings. It's fast, and it keeps taking us.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Ask her where the moon is at night–\nMARISHA: Does it seem to come at a certain time of the night?","response":"DM: “The dark time.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's a cow. This is the same as before.\nTRAVIS: Because nothing is happening I am now trying to eat grass.","response":"DM: You bend down, and take clusters with your hand, and start eating grass."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, we are ourselves, still?","response":"DM: Yeah, you are not actually physically cows. You are still yourselves. You just look like cows."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I, for once, and it's not weird, I just shit on the floor.\nSAM: Seems totally normal.\nTRAVIS: We are in it, baby!\nLAURA: I'm just going to notch a bow to my bow, just to keep a lookout to the sky.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Can I Prestidigitate smells?","response":"DM: You could."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sweet. Go ahead.\nMARISHA: They're cows. I forgot that talking to cows never goes well.\nLAURA: Yeah, remember Dork?\nMARISHA: Didn't seem to know a lot. They're simple-minded beasts.\nLAURA: Dork the ox.\nMARISHA: Yeah, poor Dork. Dork the ox.","response":"DM: Rest in peace, Dork."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Pour a little out.","response":"DM: You guys make your way. You wait a while, a good two-hour period, as cows, before eventually you, keeping your eye to the sky with your arrow nocked, see a whisk of shadow across the moonlight."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whistles)\nTRAVIS: What was that?\nLAURA: I'm letting you guys fucking know there's a thing in the sky.\nORION: Is it Jumanji time?\nSAM: Not quite.","response":"DM: At this point, you guys look up, and you see something circle once. It looks like a bird. It's just not as big as you were expecting. Looks like a bigger hawk."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I cast Stoneskin on myself.","response":"DM: Okay. Bigger and bigger"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: My cow is going stealth.","response":"DM: Roll for cow stealth!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 23.","response":"DM: Okay. You're still a cow."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I make myself look available. I step away from the rest of the herd a little bit.\nTRAVIS: I go into a cow rage and start chewing faster.\nLAURA: I Hunter's Mark it.","response":"DM: Okay. Well, it has to come within range first."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: As soon as it is.","response":"DM: As it swoops down, you see this bird just gets larger and larger and you realize it was quite a distance away. And now that it's getting closer, the tales you've heard are true. This is at least a 100-foot wing span, if not more."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to fix my ring on it.\nMARISHA: 100-foot wing span?\nORION: As it gets close I'm going to brace my ring as it's coming towards us.","response":"DM: Okay. It comes. It dives down with extreme speed and goes into a dive. It comes into range. You cast Hunter's Mark on it. You have your ring ready. What you doing?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Cast Slow on it!\nORION: 17.","response":"DM: And what is the save?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is it wisdom or charisma or something?\nORION: It's concentration! No, wait, it is a concentration.\nORION: 17.","response":"DM: 17. That is an 18. Rolled a natural 18 on that one. As it swoops down, you release the spell, you are immediately attempting to be grasped in its talons. That is a 23 to hit."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That hits.\nLAURA: I thought we were just–","response":"DM: Oh. Okay. Sorry. You're not in cow form, are you? You're illusioned. You're staying normal?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, I'm normal.\nLIAM: How fast can the rest of us do anything? It's gone?","response":"DM: Now you guys can react. It is currently 60 feet away from you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I immediately– oh god! I shoot it.\nSAM: Do we have to roll for initiative?","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But I was notched already.\nLAURA: 21.","response":"DM: 21."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 17.\nTRAVIS: 18.\nMARISHA: 16.","response":"DM: Vax. Keyleth. Scanlan? Tiberius? What you guys got?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Six.\nORION: Five.\nLAURA: I'm going to shoot it through the Blazing Bowstring.","response":"DM: Okay. Go for it. Roll for the attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 16.","response":"DM: 16 hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (counts quietly) 26.\nLAURA: And then I'm going to shoot it again.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That one definitely hits: 26.","response":"DM: Yeah! That hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 26 again.\nTRAVIS: I take the Firebrand Warhammer, activate it, turn on the fire. And I put the Chain of Returning on it and throw it at the winged beast.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and roll with disadvantage because it's already roughly 40 to 60 feet away from you. It's tough to get there. But you can try."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 15. Nope. 16.","response":"DM: Okay. Due to its distance and the dark cover of night, it's harder to hit and you actually swing and throw it and the hammer– The chain goes taut and it just drops to the ground and it's just out of range of the hammer, as it escapes the range it would have hit it with."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I pull it back?\nLIAM: I'd like to use a bonus action to click Boots of Haste together, and I think if I do that, I have two actions at that point, right?","response":"DM: No. Well you do have an additional action that can be used only to attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just attack. So what I want to do is click the Boots of Haste together, use the original action to run as far as I can towards the bird, and then use my final action to sneak attack the thing since it's got Keyleth in its talons. That's up to you.","response":"DM: Okay. The sneak attack will not kick in because Keyleth is not threatening the creature. But you go for the attacks. You rush up, you dash, you get underneath it– for a moment, because of the Boots of Haste, you keep speed with this giant, darting creature. You, underneath, throw your daggers upward."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm trying to be a Boy Scout here. Wouldn't the Boots of Haste clicking be the bonus action? Yeah. That is 22 to hit.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's ten. Ten.","response":"DM: Ten?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Dagger. Roll again for disadvantage because it's just within your secondary throwing range."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh yeah. Then I missed.","response":"DM: Okay. It vanishes into the dark night ahead of you. So yeah. That is gone. You still have your Belt of Returning, you just don't have your snake belt. Yeah, don't worry guys. I saw the look on your face and I'm like, no, it's fine. It comes back. Okay. Keyleth, you're up. You're currently grappled and held within the talons of this giant bird. You see the entire ground below you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Judging by the fairly close up appearance I have of him at this point, can I tell it is probably a “beast” nature?","response":"DM: At the sheer size, it's hard to tell. You've never encountered a beast of this size, but you do look up and you can see the talons that are currently holding you in place and piercing the sides of your armor are bird-like talons. And you do see a series of dark feathers coating the entire underbelly of this entity."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to attempt to cast Dominate Beast.\nMARISHA: It has to make a wisdom saving throw.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is your Enhance Ability still active? From before?","response":"DM: That's for ability checks. So you finish casting the spell. Apparently, this entity is not affected by the spell."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Fuck-sticks.\nSAM: It's not a beast?","response":"DM: It is not a beast. There's a fine line when certain creatures of nature are altered by some sort of magical essence or their nature perhaps is not natural at the get-go. Either they were created or over time they became something beyond beast. This seems to fall under that category."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's my turn, right?","response":"DM: That's your turn. That brings us to its turn."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I try and break the grapple as a bonus action?","response":"DM: That would be your action to try and break the grapple. For this creature's turn, it does a full double dash of its full flight speed and is about 250 feet away from you and completely out of your guys' reach. You see it (whoosh) up into the sky, disappearing to the north, north-northwest area beyond Emon, carrying Keyleth in its claws."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Keyleth, just get out of its fucking hands and fall. You can change. We'll catch you; we'll do something! Just fall.","response":"DM: You're close enough where you can still hear this, as the desperation kicks in and you realize– seeing your whole party not even visible at this point except a couple of dark dots in the low light of the night."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is it our turn yet?","response":"DM: It now comes to Scanlan's turn."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. I Dimension Door.","response":"DM: What's the range on Dimension Door?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 500 feet.","response":"DM: You– and appear where? Where do you want to appear?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: On it. On its back.","response":"DM: Okay. You appear right on its back. You immediately land and start sliding back as the wind is pushing on you. The feathers themselves, due to the aerodynamic nature of its flight path; it's a lot of wind resistance against you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, make an acrobatics check.\nORION: Shush! What the hell?!","response":"DM: No, I was going there. Don't worry. That's what it is. You need to go ahead and make an acrobatics check to see if you can maintain balance on the back of this beast."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: My intelligence is not six!\nSAM: 20!","response":"DM: You manage to just, you tumble backward a little bit. You grab a couple of feathers and get yourself just on the side underneath where the wing meets part of the upper torso, where the wind resistance is the least amount, and you manage to hold on. You are now clutching the back of this giant bird. That's your turn."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. As my bonus action, I will inspire Keyleth. Right? She's right next to me?\nMARISHA: Scanlan? What the shit?","response":"DM: Due to the wind, you don't hear the last line. It's too loud around it. However, you can take a d10 inspiration dice."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and MARISHA: Yay!\nLIAM: What a heroic move! Amazing!","response":"DM: Which for the record, this currently right now looks like– you see the cow clutched below, and currently there is a cow holding onto this giant bird."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It lasts eight hours.\nORION: Good. I drop Stoneskin. At 5th-level, I go myself, one, two, three– I cast Fly on all of us. Fly, you fools! And go right after them.\nLIAM: The cows take off into the night sky.\nORION: (shouting) Fly, Vox Machina! Moo!\nMARISHA: Vox “Moo-china!”\n(booing)","response":"DM: A squadron of weirdly-sized, flying cows lit by moonlight, chasing after a giant bird. I love Dungeons and Dragons."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What is this?","response":"DM: What's the flying speed on Fly?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 60 feet.","response":"DM: 60 feet. Cool."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to dash. On that.","response":"DM: Yep. You guys can go 120 feet every turn. It can go 240. Two rounds pass before you guys realize there is no way you're going to catch up with this thing or get even close to it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I've got Haste!\nLAURA: I've got Hunter's Mark on it, so I can track it.\nLIAM: Double me, yo! I got Haste.","response":"DM: Your Haste speed– your physical body doesn't affect the Fly spell, unfortunately. You're only at the speed that the arcane nature of the spell can take you. I'm just saying. Your metabolism's real fast. Your heartbeat's hummingbirding it. But you're still only going 120 feet. So as you guys follow behind, you can see now, after a while on the edge of the shoreline, not too far from Emon– maybe what would normally be from horseback or a brisk walk, a half day's travel– you eventually come upon the– There it is! You come upon the coastal mountains known as the Shoreline Summit. It's a series of unusually steep mountain bluffs that hug the coastline, northwest of Emon. As you get closer, and at this point you've lost sight of the bird. Scanlan, I want you to go ahead and roll an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Athletics? Well, that doesn't count. That's not good. Athletics? 16.\nMARISHA: Do I have a turn yet?","response":"DM: You can go ahead and take your turn now too, yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah? I cast Polymorph on it. You're on it.\nSAM: Don't worry about me!\nMARISHA: Really?\nSAM: I'm fine! You never need to worry about me. Haven't you guys learned that by now? I'm fine!\nMARISHA: Out of thematic reasons, I also turn him into a cow.\nSAM: That's amazing!\nLIAM: Is what she cries out heroically.","response":"DM: Okay. What's the DC on this?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: My spell DC? 18.","response":"DM: Rolled a one."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm a cow on a cow with a cow!","response":"DM: So this giant flying bird– Moo! And just begins to plummet at an extremely fast speed. You both immediately are released from its grasp. Scanlan and Keyleth both are just falling. You guys don't see this. It's too far away from you now. At this point, you're probably close to about 500 feet in the air."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yo, I heard you liked cows, so I gave you some cows with your cow.\nMARISHA: I go eagle form.","response":"DM: Flailing cows. You go eagle form. You're fine. So you go into eagle form. That's your action this turn. That's your bonus action, because you can do that as a–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: As a bonus action!","response":"DM: Eagle form. Scanlan, you plummet full speed on this one. You probably have another two rounds before you impact with something very painful."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But he's as heavy as a dust mote, so he just goes like this all the way down. Right?\nMARISHA: I don't think that's how it works.\nORION: No, he's a little pebble.\nMARISHA: I can catch him, if you need catched.","response":"DM: You guys still continue to give chase. Eventually, you see this giant thing just go and vanish from sight. It's just gone. It just disappeared."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I go full Gandalf.\nLIAM: Never go full Gandalf.","response":"DM: You guys are pushing forward. So it's now the next round for you guys to react. What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I will become a pterodactyl.","response":"DM: So you're casting?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Polymorph on myself?","response":"DM: Okay. Because you are falling and this is a lot of wind, I'm going to have to ask you to make a concentration check to complete the spell."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Come on, Scanlan!","response":"DM: So go ahead and roll a d20."}
{"prompt":"SAM: This is a concentration not on holding a spell, but on casting it?","response":"DM: Correct. Because as part of the components of it and maintaining your attention to the spell–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What does he add? His spell attack bonus?","response":"DM: This? No, this is a d20 and– let me make sure, yeah– it's a d20 and then you add your plus five from your charisma."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Charisma? That's a natural 20.","response":"DM: With that– (screeches) pterodactyl."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Tables have turned, motherfucker! Tables have turned!\nORION: You're both flying cows!\nLAURA: Wait! Was Seeming a concentration?\nORION: I think it lasts for like eight hours.\nLAURA: Did it drop? Are we no longer cows?\nSAM: I think so. I'll check.\nLIAM: Hey! You're not a cow anymore!\nLAURA: Oh my god, you're not a cow anymore!\nLIAM: Oh! Awesome!","response":"DM: You guys keep flying. You guys catch yourselves."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Nope, not concentration. It just lasts for eight hours.","response":"DM: You guys are all still flying cows. You're all still just a squadron of flying, illusory cows, which you guys are both now transformed into an eagle and a pterodactyl, but you still look like cows."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: As the twins are flying, I say, hey, did you notice we have the same pattern? Twins!","response":"DM: About this time, you hear a loud, impactful boom. And there's a cloud of dust partway into the side of this first bit of mountain range that you come upon, a little bit distant from you guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I fly down towards it?","response":"DM: You start heading in that direction. Because of the speed it was traveling at and the way it was carrying at the speed it was going, it's still ahead of you guys. And you see the impact. You hear this loud screeching sound and you see now where there was a little poof of cloud, these wings unfold and (flapping) make its way back up."}
{"prompt":"ORION: How far away from it are we?","response":"DM: You guys right now at the close to six minutes you've been traveling–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Did it not drop the cow to zero hit points?","response":"DM: All the damage carries over."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The remainder of that damage went into its hit points.","response":"DM: You don't know. It looks hurt. It looks like it wasn't happy about it. It continues back up. From you Tiberius, it's probably close to 700 to 800 feet away from you. It's because of the speed it was traveling and the speed you guys were following. It was gaining on you every single turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it flying away from us now?","response":"DM: It's heading up into the mountain range."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Fly after that motherfucker!\nLAURA: Should we still track it? It's still nighttime, right?","response":"DM: It's still nighttime, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: It's only 500 feet away from me right now?","response":"DM: 600 to 500 feet."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay, cool. Well I'm going for it, still.","response":"DM: What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're all following it.\nORION: Where am I? It's taking off right now and I'm over here?","response":"DM: You're back here. It's now starting to take off and head up towards the top of this mountain range that you're just starting to come upon."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Okay. If it's doing that, then I'll fucking go higher and try to meet it where it's going.","response":"DM: Okay. Cool. The rest of you guys continue to give chase. Now that it's returned to its form, it travels an additional double dash: 240 feet. As this progresses, it's far beyond any of you guys in a matter of seconds."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is the mountain range really far away?\nLIAM: Can you track it?\nLAURA: I can track it! Of course.","response":"DM: So you're keeping your attention on it?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.","response":"DM: The winds also are pretty strong as you get close to the mountains. As you coast around each, you start actually diving into this middle valley area."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Does that affect any spells?\nLAURA: No, it just makes us stealth easier.\nSAM: It doesn't drop Hunter's Mark?","response":"DM: Is it concentration?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where does it say it?\nSAM: There's a C next to it somewhere.\nLAURA: Oh, never mind! It's a concentration. Forget it! I don't know how these things work yet.\nSAM: Yeah, stick to the bows and arrows.","response":"DM: Traveling through this area, you can see the mountains. The way that they're constructed in this area, it's not a gradual crag. A lot of these are just punched up in the air, like whatever heavy seismic force that created these initially was very localized and very powerful. A lot of the mountains are spire-like. They come up with very sheer sides and you can see why this mountain range is largely not utilized or traversed or generally spoken of often because it's too dangerous for most average folk to even attempt to climb or use for any good reason. The winds are high and powerful here at the tops, as well. And as you're flying around, the winds blowing across, and you get pushed off your course a little bit here and there, but you still keep up, best as possible. You leading the charge. Over about five minutes of searching through this mountain range, you sense that its movement eventually comes to stop."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: There's a nest.\nSAM: Wait, you sense that he came to a stop?\nLAURA: He came to a stop a little bit ahead of us.\nSAM: Let's go get him.\nLAURA: Can we all try to stealth in?\nSAM: I'm a pterodactyl, so–\nMARISHA: Yeah, let's go for the element of surprise. Well, technically, we're all still cows.","response":"DM: Yes. And you guys cannot talk because you're actually in creature forms."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I'll still fly.","response":"DM: So you would not get the advantage because air is not your favored terrain. So everyone who wishes to, go ahead and roll stealth checks"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: All of us?","response":"DM: All of you who wish to try and come at it from a quiet–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (pterodactyl screech)","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: With advantage, I rolled a two.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm not used to being flying, really.\nSAM: Five.\nORION: Are we flying anymore?","response":"DM: You guys are all still flying, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, no.\nMARISHA: 21.\nTRAVIS: 14.\nLAURA: 28.","response":"DM: Yeah, so. You guys following behind Vex, many of you clumsily and some of you shouting out to each other, “I think she sees it this way.” And you're like, “oh my god.” You come around this one bend and you can see one of the larger mountainous spires that has a lot of trees and green growth towards the top at certain places where the rock juts out and gives a shelf for such greenery to grow, outside of its sheer outside surface. You do see a couple of wings fold in against the moonlight in what looks to be an outcropping. And there are multiple layers of rock shelves on the side of this mountain. And on one of these outcroppings, there appears to be some sort of a nest: a cluster of almost like actual trees and pieces of wood that are all jammed into this giant nest that's nestled against where the shadow and the moonlight are fighting for some sort of visual on it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Big-ass tree fortress.\nLAURA: Did we just find like a mama bird and baby birds?\nMARISHA: Yeah, we did.\nLAURA: What are we going to do?\nLIAM: We're going to take out the mom and train the babies.\nSAM: What are we going to do?\nLIAM: Yeah. We're going to capture those babies and we're going to train them.\nORION: That's a good idea. I like that idea.\nSAM: Like Avatar?\nORION: Yes.\nTRAVIS: You could go in.\nLAURA: Me go in? There's a giant fucking nest here! I get close to it. As close as I feel safe getting to it.","response":"DM: You guys all stay back or do you go with her?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to cast Greater Invisibility on myself and then follow.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys have 12 seconds before you all plummet."}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh wait! No! I don't do that. Damn it! I forget we're still flying.\nTRAVIS: What part of the flying part did you forget?\nORION: I thought we'd landed already.","response":"DM: Are you guys all going with Vex, or are you all staying back and she's going on her own?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are we going to lose Fly, or do we keep it?","response":"DM: Are you casting Greater Invisibility?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No.","response":"DM: Then no, you're fine."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is it the same stealth roll or an additional stealth roll to go forward at this point?","response":"DM: No this was your stealth roll on approaching."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh. Well, I mean, I knew I rolled shitty.","response":"DM: You don't know you rolled shitty."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm going in.\nLAURA: This is so stupid.\nTRAVIS: Hoof in hoof.","response":"DM: Okay, yeah. So you guys all realize you must keep close together to Tiberius as you come in. Keeping too much of a distance would be a bad thing. You come upon the underneath portion of this outcropping, and you can see within a quick glance– go ahead and make a perception check, all of you guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: All of us?","response":"DM: All of you who are coming up in this cluster."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Three.\nLAURA: Do I get an advantage because we're in a mountain environment at all?","response":"DM: Nope. Actually no. Because you're seeing things on a mountain, I will give you advantage on this."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes!\nMARISHA: 12.","response":"DM: 12?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 16.\nSAM: Nothing.\nLIAM: 13.\nLAURA: 12.","response":"DM: So the highest was?"}
{"prompt":"ORION: 16.","response":"DM: 16. You got?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Three.","response":"DM: As you guys all look up, it's very shadowy over here. It's hard to see. The moonlight's in your eye a little bit and the darkness is so pitch. The umbra of this particular shadow is very dark and crushed. You make out, in the nest, the large bird creature has folded its wings and is currently leaning down. And you see something in the nest that's much smaller moving up next to it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't want to kill a mama.\nLAURA: But she's killing the farmers' stuff.\nMARISHA: Maybe we can transplant her.\nSAM: To a wildlife preserve?\nLAURA: Maybe. And her babies?\nMARISHA: Capture her and move her away from town?\nLIAM: That seems complicated.\nSAM: Are they on the highest peak?","response":"DM: No. There's two other levels up above this. This one just is one of the largest outcroppings."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to swoop up over them. See if there's any boulders to drop.","response":"DM: Okay. Looking over it, there are no loose rocks or boulders. In fact, because of the construction of these mountains, they're solid spires that jut up and then abruptly end. All the erosion that happens here appears to be gradual enough– that's why the sides of the mountains are so smooth and unclimbable."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So there's a sheer peak and they're nested on the side of it?","response":"DM: Yeah. It's a sheer peak that rounds off at the very top and there are little outcroppings that jut out in places as it goes down. But those are more towards the top, and as you go down further– as most of the erosion hits the mountain lower and lower, it has carved off or destroyed most of what would have been previous outcroppings, or smoothed them over."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: How far away are we now?","response":"DM: You guys are probably a good 60 or 50 feet if you're trying to get up within range of your Fly. Right? What's the range of on that? Fly?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Fly? Oh, here.","response":"DM: I got it. No! There is no range on it. You just touch them. So you're fine. Yeah. As long as you're concentrating on it, you're fine."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So we're within 60 feet?","response":"DM: Well, you guys have been keeping a little more of a distance down here. However, at this point, as you guys are all encroaching and Scanlan's gone overhead, a voice rings out against the darkness, “Flying cows? Really? I care not for this insolence. If you've come to mock me or fight me, do it now! Or leave this creature alone!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What? Where are you? Who are you? Who said that?\nORION: I rolled an arcana check of 17 of my surroundings– where it's coming from.\nLAURA: Ditto. I try to perceive where it's coming from.","response":"DM: Okay. Arcana check– there's nothing arcane in nature. It's not omnipresent or coming from any certain place. There is a direction it's coming from, which is from the outcropping or nest area. There's nothing arcane in nature to it. It's in the shadow. You can't really see it from this distance."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it in front of us? To the side of us? Is it coming from where the bird seems to be?","response":"DM: It's coming from where the bird is."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He's controlling it.\nMARISHA: I fly over as an eagle.\nLAURA: You still look like a cow eagle.\nMARISHA: Can we drop Seeming?","response":"DM: It's not under your control, and you can't talk, too."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay. I yell out, you've been stealing the farmers' livestock. Give us a reason not to kill you.\nSAM: That's good. That's good. Diplomacy.\nORION: Or, I mean, moo!","response":"DM: Okay. You guys are all keeping distance from it? The voice comes out again, “Your nature confuses me and your words seem ill-informed. If you're not going to come to speak of discourse, I'm going to assume that you're my enemy.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Then, as he's saying that, I'll approach.","response":"DM: So Tiberius cow goes."}
{"prompt":"ORION: And as I approach the thing, I'm going to Dispel Magic on myself.","response":"DM: Okay. Cool. For Dispel Magic, I need you to go ahead, just for the sake of this– I won't consider it contested because you're allies in this thing. So you land. Tiberius' form shimmers and returns back to that of a dragonborn, and you're standing there on the precipice. Go ahead and roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: What is that? 11.","response":"DM: Okay. It's hard to make out the details, but the voice is definitely coming from the nest. You see there is something vaguely humanoid, but it's hard to make out the shape at this distance with this low light, especially since you aren't a darkvision-gifted entity. However, it's close to this bird creature."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to say, is this big bird thing asleep?","response":"DM: “You will not harm this creature, poachers!”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm not trying to harm it at all. I'm just seeing if it's fine. If we could talk. I can't see anything, and I wanted to cast Light so I could see something, but I don't want to hurt your bird's eyes.","response":"DM: You can see the bird's moving and it's looking towards your direction. And it has this like (soft snarl)."}
{"prompt":"ORION: So it's awake?","response":"DM: It's awake, and it looks hurt. The voice is like, “You come here masqueraded as whatever manner of beasts that you are–”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Cows. We were cows.","response":"DM: “After tormenting and severely wounding this beautiful creature.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: We didn't do anything to the creature. No, we were– This creature was stealing the farmer's cows, and the farmers were saying, “You've taken our livestock,” which is hurting the farm. We came to help them and we posed as cows, and then your bird took our–\nLIAM: While he's blithering, can I make an additional cow stealth check?","response":"DM: To?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: To come up behind the guy. Near him. Not even near him. Just to get a better vantage point.","response":"DM: Go for it. Make it with a disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Does that cancel out with my advantage from my cloak?\nLAURA: A cow in a cloak.","response":"DM: You are a flying cow in the moonlight against an individual that is very aware of your presence."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Shut up, baby, I know it.\nLIAM: That is good.\nLAURA: That's 31.\nLIAM: Yeah. 31.","response":"DM: (chuckles) You stealthily cow your way up to the side of this precipice. Seemingly unnoticed. Getting a view of this creature now, you can see this nest is a cluster of driftwood and chunks of shipwreck and carts and wagon wheels and whatever pieces of wood have been scavenged from different time periods. Some are weathered, some are more fresh. And trees, whole trees that are broken and shredded have all been cobbled together to make this nest. In the center of this– I'm going to take the intensity down on this a little bit– you see, there up against this bird– and the bird itself is twitching and looks like it's hurt. Not deeply hurt, but hurt. You see a small humanoid. Pretty small. Scanlan small. Hard to make out details, but it is currently in the process of doing a repeated hand motion and then touching. A hand motion and then touching. And you've seen this motion before."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Touching what?","response":"DM: Touching the bird. There is a perpetual string of Cure Wounds being applied to this bird."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I also approach and come out of my eagle form.\nORION: Light.\nSAM: Are you landing somewhere?\nMARISHA: Next to Tiberius.\nORION: But I'm going to block it with my hand so it's not going to blind the bird.","response":"DM: Okay.  As the light picks up, you can see the bird turns away for a second and starts to like flap its wings instinctually. And once again, seeing it up close, this bird is really big. The humanoid entity becomes immediately visible. And it is a gnome. You can see, he's dressed in hides and roughly crafted leather and furs. He has tousled, greasy black hair that hangs past his shoulders, covering a bedraggled and bearded face. Holding up his arm– and looks thin. It's covering the light and he's like, “You!”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Sorry. I tried to not blind you. It was very dark. I'm sorry. Hello. We mean you no harm.","response":"DM: The gnome slams this small wooden, for lack of a better term, a small staff or cane. Slams it into the ground with a foot stomp and you can see the gnome's entire body suddenly begin to shift and change into this dark, gnarled-looking, hard surface."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I whack him in the back of the head.\nLAURA: No! It's just Barkskin! It's just defense!\nLIAM: Let's get ready to rumble.\nLIAM: I pause.","response":"DM: You pause? You are currently now crouched right behind the edge of this nest, and you can't even actually see the guy anymore because in order to get up there, you've come underneath to stay hidden and you're just there behind."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I see Vax?","response":"DM: No. Well, actually go ahead and roll a perception check. Is it higher than a 31?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is it higher than a 31? No.","response":"DM: You have no idea where Vax is."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm way up above them still, right? Do I see anything?","response":"DM: No, actually. You see, there's another section above there. It looks like there's nothing else of interest, other than some growth, a few bushes, and some vines that hang down the side."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Somebody talk to him before I kill this fucking bird.\nORION: I am talking to him.\nMARISHA: I land beside Tiberius and come out of eagle form. Tiberius, would you please Dispel this cow form from me. Please? Thank you.","response":"DM: Okay. And with that, you cast Dispel Magic and Keyleth's form reverts that to Keyleth. Normal Keyleth. Non-cow Keyleth. The gnome character now has the staff at the back and has a hand in front and is like, (panting)."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Are you a druid? I'm also a druid. I think our goals might be aligned.","response":"DM: “Really?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's okay. What's her name?","response":"DM: “This creature has no name to it yet. I, myself, am a protector of the wild, as you claim to be, as well. I have no tribe but the trees around me. I hear the whisper of the wind, and it calls for justice.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can relate to that.","response":"DM: “Then why do you follow? Why do you insist on harming this creature?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Because we were seeking justice for other people.\nORION: The life and purpose of their existence is to keep those other people alive.","response":"DM: “And why is it not the same with this creature? If they cannot guard their livestock, why is it not food for this thing, as well? It is the natural life cycle that they've removed themselves from.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: When one has an establishment, when one grows its own crop, and one steals something, it is considered a crime.","response":"DM: “Well, when one is not part of that civilization, but the civilization of the world as a whole, which requires hunting for what keeps you alive, perhaps that does not sink or hang on my conscience.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Fair point.\nMARISHA: Let's not let this escalate. Okay? What is your name?","response":"DM: “I was once called Byron.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Vyron?","response":"DM: “Byron.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Byron.","response":"DM: “I have not heard my name nor spoken words for many years.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Would you not like to be called Byron, or would you like something else, like B-roy or B-man? My name's Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia. And this is my friend Keyleth, who is also a druid. And we also have a friend who is a gnome who sings songs and whatnot.","response":"DM: The bird, now looking of much better health than it was when it arrived, now flutters its wings out in a stretching motion. And as it does, its head glides down and looks right towards you. This giant beak that looks like it could snap you in two with a single bite."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I reach up to it and reach out to pet its beak.","response":"DM: I'm going to ask you to make an animal handling check on this. Just to see where this goes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nSAM: I gently start swooping down to check on my friends.\nMARISHA: 19.\nMARISHA: I kneel down a bit. Produce a few Goodberries. Reach out.\nSAM: Bye, Keyleth. This is how we lose one of our members. Feeding a bird.","response":"DM: The creature leans forward and the giant bird, you can see its dark, black eyes staring at you. Each eye probably about the size of your torso. As the giant beak comes down, you can see the moonlight gliding off the smooth exterior of the dark black beak. It smells. And you take 27 points of piercing damage as the animal takes the Goodberries and almost your entire hand with it, as well. At that size, it's hard to be gentle."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's a good girl.\nSAM: Is it?","response":"DM: Swallows."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is it a good girl?\nORION: I'm feeding a tiny snack to Lockheed.\nMARISHA: I turn back to Byron–\nSAM: And say, ow.\nMARISHA: Yeah, and go, that hurt. Now. Please listen to me. Please, please listen to me. We did come here to kill the giant creature.","response":"DM: “I had assumed.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But upon seeing the situation, upon approach, realized the situation and decided amongst all of us that we did not want to bring such a great creature to its death.","response":"DM: Scanlan, you've landed by now. A pterodactyl. A cow-looking pterodactyl."}
{"prompt":"ORION: As he swoops, I've never seen anything quite like it.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'm going to aid her, too.\nSAM: All I've seen so far is Keyleth's bloody hand.\nMARISHA: 20 total.","response":"DM: You have advantage on this because Tiberius is aiding you on this conversation."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'll take that 20 total.\nMARISHA: Under one condition.","response":"DM: “There's always a condition. You call yourself a druid, yet you speak like the civilized folk. I get the feeling that perhaps your connection to nature has not been tended to for some time.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No, she really knows her stuff. I mean, we just fought this fire guy–\nMARISHA: Just because one can appreciate nature, does not mean that one cannot also appreciate humanity.","response":"DM: “Well, this beautiful creature is the only surviving young of a clutch, bred by a majestic roc high in the Cliffkeep Mountains. Its mother now lies dead, slain by the brutal giants that wander those peaks. This young'un is all that remains of that clutch and the memory of that blessed entity.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's a young'un?","response":"DM: This is a young one. “This new home serves us well. Abundance of feed. Lack of large, predatory creatures. I believe this is where we'll stay.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Question. If this is a young, adolescent creature, what do you think of the destruction it could cause once it reaches full adulthood? Are you okay with having that on your conscience? This creature could result in the lives of many. If you relocate out of town, just a few miles. Say like 50 or 100 or so because this thing's really damn big. So I'm sure it's got a pretty big– you know what I mean.\nORION: Or just the other way.\nMARISHA: I will help you. I will personally come with you and tend to their safety. And make sure that their location is proper and safe, and handled with respect. Then you will be out of the harms of poachers. You can live off the land, and you can be free and alone.","response":"DM: “Do you think we came straight to this mountain range? Do you think this is the first nest we've constructed? Me and this lone survivor have scoured the length of this side of Tal'Dorei. This, as far as I can see, is the safest. It's the most ignored by nearby civilization.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Listen–\nSAM: I'm going to drop Seeming and also drop my form of pterodactyl.","response":"DM: All of you now, your forms change. As this happens mid-sentence, it's noticed immediately by the gnome druid, who's like (gasps)."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes! That is correct. Listen. We are being nice. Don't think that we will be the first. You will have more people come and hunt you and kill this, as this beast continues. How long do you think you can survive waves of mercenaries coming to try and kill this? We are the nice ones. I suggest you heed our warning, take our help, and save the life of you and your creature in the long run.","response":"DM: “You have yet to provide a suitable alternative.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Oh! I might have an idea.\nMARISHA: There is an alternative. Tiberius can tell you of that alternative.\nORION: Yes! See, your creature is rather large and powerful, yes? You have a rather strong bond with him, which is quite unique with such a unique looking creature.\nMARISHA: I was setting you up for an awesome one-liner, man! You were supposed to be like, the other option is death.\nLIAM: Ask him if he's considered Whitestone?\nORION: Whitestone? Yeah! Well, I guess there's a couple of options, really. There's this town Whitestone that's pretty great and has a lot of livestock that this creature can consume.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I don't know about that.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a deception check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: That is a 24.","response":"DM: “Whitestone. How far is this Whitestone?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Well, the other option was, like I was saying, perhaps you can form an agreement with Emon. I'm sure it would pay in livestock rather well for the protection of you, such a powerful druid, over at least a section of the land. In exchange for free food for your friend.","response":"DM: “You, dragon man, are adorably naive of the ways of men and those that lie and deceive. I have yet to have met any civilized people who have kept their word when it came to creatures like this.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: That's right! That's true!\nMARISHA: That actually is fairly true.\nLAURA: There's so many monsters out there, they don't hunt them all because there's too many.\nORION: That's a wonderful idea, Vex. Yes!","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I'll aid her, as well.","response":"DM: I'll say you've aided one person recently. This'll just be her check on this. He really doesn't trust you, given the current circumstances."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 21.","response":"DM: Natural 20."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Then as a natural 20, you know that's good for you. That's the best place you can go. You can see the wisdom in my persuasion.\nORION: It is true, though. I mean, it's just feed walking all around for it.\nMARISHA: Please, please listen to us. We're only trying to help.\nSAM: Is there a young creature around here besides the–","response":"DM: No, looking about you, no."}
{"prompt":"SAM: There's no babies there?","response":"DM: No. This is the young. This bird is like the adolescent."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Please believe me. I let this thing almost take my hand off, and I'm still standing here fairly cogently talking to you, so please take that as a sign of honesty.\nLAURA: I go and put my hand on her back and cast Cure Wounds, because I got that spell now, yo!\nSAM: Where are we telling them to go?\nTRAVIS: To Vasselheim.\nSAM: Vasselheim?\nMARISHA: Listen. She's right. We have friends in Vasselheim. We can contact the Slayer's Take. We're a part of their guild. We can tell them that you're coming. They'll not bother you. We can tell them they are not allowed to take out a contract on your creature. You will not be harmed.\nLAURA: Don't bring up contracts, Keyleth. Maybe just don't even bring it up.\nMARISHA: Because they don't have mercenaries out there. It has to be approved! So it's really good.","response":"DM: “And what's to stop them from hunting down a majestic creature as rare as this one?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Us!","response":"DM: “You, who live here in Emon?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: Yes. No, us who are members of the guild.","response":"DM: “So you also are monster slayers, who come here under the guise to slay this monster?”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: No! Not here. Other places that we're forced to do it. But still we're members.","response":"DM: “It's too much talk.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can we kill this thing now? You guys are doing awesome.\nMARISHA: I feel like I've done pretty damn good! Come on, man!\nSAM: I start speaking in Gnome to him. Listen. Earlier, you said that this place was perfect. It was safe. There were no large predators. Well, you're looking at six large predators. We'll keep hunting you down and hunting your beast down until you get out of here. This is your one and only warning. You must leave, and you must leave now. We're giving you a good choice, a safe choice. We can help you get there and be safe there. But if you don't listen to us, we'll start killing.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How many fucking persuasion rolls does this asshole need?\nSAM: Persuasion?","response":"DM: This is essentially a conversational skill challenge. So every success and failure leads towards where the conversation's going to end."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 32.","response":"DM: He gives you a look. Very intense, looking into your very essence-type stare. His little beady gnomish eyes meeting yours. (sighs) “If we're going to make this journey to where you say this Vasselheim is, how far is it?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Several days' journey.\nLAURA: It's just across the water. You could fly no problem over it.","response":"DM: “Across the sea?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's across the sea.\nSAM: We can draw you a map. We can give you provisions. We'll even make sure the farmers provide you with a few pieces of livestock to chow down on before the journey. A parting gift to fuel up before the big ride. We can give you papers to hand to the Slayer's Take that will ensure that you'll be treated fairly.\nORION: I'll take out my Scroll of Telescription and start writing a note.","response":"DM: He looks back towards Keyleth, looks back at Scanlan, looks back at Keyleth, looks up at the bird."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Please. We really don't need another death on our conscience today.","response":"DM: “Then looks like we don't have much of a choice, do we? If you can assure us enough food to get across on this journey, we'll make our way towards this Vasselheim. I pray on the solidarity between our kin, and our kin, that you speak the truth that resonates this moment. Because if it does not, may the fall of this entity and myself weigh on your conscience.”"}
{"prompt":"ORION: I flip over the note that I'm writing to him and then I trigger it (flying noise) as he's reading it.\nSAM: I bow deeply and when I do, it goes (cowbell ringing).","response":"DM: For a moment, you think you hear a slight, uncontrollable chuckle from the gnome."}
{"prompt":"ORION: As that's going on, because we're going to head back right now to seal this up, right? Then I'll do my Teleportation Circle. Which is closer to the northeast: the Lyceum or the Keep?","response":"DM: To the north side of it? That would be the Lyceum."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We could fly back pretty fast. Couldn't we?","response":"DM: If he has another Fly spell, you could take it right back."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, we can just fly back.\nMARISHA: Before he leaves. Well, wait! We've got to go to the farm.\nSAM: We've got to go to the farmers. We've got to buy some cows off them.\nMARISHA: And I tell him, if you're up that way, there's a druidic tribe, a little village called Pyrah. They're Fire Ashari. You can find their headmaster Cerkonos. He's a friend. You might find your people there. Who knows? Maybe friends will do you good.","response":"DM: “Ashari, you say? My dealings with them have been mixed. Perhaps I'll keep my distance.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I see if there's any feathers dropped from the giant bird creature?","response":"DM: There are ample around."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I grab a few of them?","response":"DM: As you go and reach up, slaps you across the knuckles."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I have a feather that he dropped?","response":"DM: “Why?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Because they're beautiful. You have to admit they're beautiful.\nLAURA: Thank you.","response":"DM: You take three roc feathers."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: They're huge, right?","response":"DM: Yeah. They're almost boat size."}
{"prompt":"ORION: I put one in my Bag of Holding, too.","response":"DM: You guys manage to get one for you and three for you guys before he's like, “Now go! Now! My patience wears thin. I'm through with talking words.” (sighs)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Sorry.\nLIAM: I walk out from behind him and just walk past.","response":"DM: (yelps)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I pay them for their two cows. Being nice, man!","response":"DM: How much do you give them?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How much are cows usually worth?","response":"DM: You've never purchased a cow, so you don't know."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes I have! I purchased Dork the ox.","response":"DM: An ox is not a cow."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shit! How much do your cows normally cost, darling?","response":"DM: This is a good question. Let me look in the book. I've not had to look up the cost of a cow before. I would put it at about maybe 40 gold each."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's way more than I expected.","response":"DM: Because they can be used for meat, they can be used for milk."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 40 gold each to make up for the loss of your cows.","response":"DM: “Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate you helping with this. And you promise, this will–”"}

Stake them.\nSAM: Okay, we'll take care of it.","response":"DM: You guys take two of the cows. You bring them to the outskirts. With rope tied around their neck, you essentially hitching-post them to the outside of this open area, about 20 to 30 feet from the actual holding pen. A few hours go by, and the sun slowly begins to rise."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Along with some other food, right?","response":"DM: Place some of their feed and things around there. Eventually, the sun begins to rise across the eastern sky. As it crests, you can see some of the farmers come out, anxiously watching from their homes. You see different families gathering. The wings beating in the air, and it swoops down (swoosh) and grabs two of them. You can see some of the families gasp and rush inside, and some are amazed to see this even happen. It takes the two, carries them up, and heads out over the Ozmit Sea, passing to the northwest side, and over the next 30 or so minutes, slowly disappears over the horizon until it's no longer visible."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The sun rose, right? Can I make a beard check?","response":"DM: You may."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Two, zero.","response":"DM: With that, (creak) the beginnings of the other side of your beard slowly begins to set in."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What happens to the existing side?","response":"DM: The existing side has rounded itself off to a nice beard. It's pretty much where it's going to be on that side. The other side is now starting to finally catch up. And that's where we'll end: on a successful beard check."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm glad we didn't fight it.\nTRAVIS: Bad for us?","response":"DM: Well, just imagine a giant bird that grabs you and then drops you off the side of a mountain. Would have been an interesting fight. Cool. That concludes a unique Percy-less bottle episode of Critical Role."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Squadron of cows.","response":"DM: Squadron of flying midnight cows. That is probably the weirdest thing that's ever– no, there's been weirder. That's in the top five of weird things that's happened in DND for me."}

Seemingly responsible for the destruction of his entire family, and have for the past five years been essentially ruling his home city and castle. They were out for a political banquet with Sovereign Uriel in Emon and the party members of Vox Machina, they were all invited to be part of this. Didn't quite go as planned. There was a scuffle and the Briarwoods absconded back to Whitestone. They sent a couple assassins out to attempt to take out their driver, who was spilling information and essentially was going to be Vox Machina's way of being free of any sort of political issues based on their actions that evening, and after much discussion and preparation and purchasing a lot of mirrors, the party took their transit over to the east-northeast towards Whitestone, where they began to traverse the Alabaster Sierras to the north, using the mountain range as opposed to going directly through the forest. There they managed to avoid encountering a bunch of harpies that were distracted by eating the horses they left behind."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Damn.","response":"DM: They camped for the evening and began to make their way through some sort of a mountainous valley that led in towards the forest surrounding Whitestone. While they were traveling down this pass, there was a rumbling, and some sort of really fast, rapid-moving large blue creature that leaped down in front, catching them off-guard. And that is where we begin today."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, right? That would have been smart.\nTALIESIN: Okay, just checking.\nTRAVIS: I never do that.\nLAURA: I know.

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.\nTRAVIS: A sexy amount of facial hair, you beast!

It could reason with me!\nLIAM: There's a lot of heads in the way.

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, so that's 17.","response":"DM: 17 hits. Just go ahead and roll the attacks in succession."}

The cliff sides go up."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Fuck.","response":"DM: –optimal impact here, instead, it's going to go there."}

{"prompt":"SAM: I approve of that.","response":"DM: I realized that its bolt is only 20 feet long. So, utilizing its optimal Lightning Bolt length, you guys were clustered together."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay.\nTALIESIN: With advantage?\nLAURA: With advantage because I'm in the mountains?","response":"DM: You do it with advantage. It only affects attacks, not for saving throws."}

And slumps to the ground, smoking off the fur."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: For my move. Is that a move action, or would it be an action-action?","response":"DM: That would be more of an action-action, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh. Oh no.","response":"DM: But you angrily turn around, release your arrow, firing a completely furious Hail of Thorns into the creature. As it hits, it shatters across its hide, some of it scattering onto Grog. You don't even care. You just focus the anger, pull out a second arrow, unleash this one. Actually jamming underneath one of the scales. You can see a little trickle of dark, deep purple blood beginning to pour from the wound."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I get out of the line.","response":"DM: Okay, where do you want to go?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Towards the little crevice.","response":"DM: Right there?"}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Brought another sign.\nTRAVIS: 14 for the second one.","response":"DM: Mm-hm."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes. 17 and 18, 19, 20, 21 plus the fire damage.","response":"DM: Good to know."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Including fire damage.\nTRAVIS: I'm going to move. Can I move towards you a little bit?","response":"DM: This way, there?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes, staying next to him, but just out of the way of other projectiles that might be coming up my butthole.\nMARISHA: Okay. I'm right next to Trinket, right?","response":"DM: Mm-hm."}

I'll give him a– shut up, Scanlan.\nLIAM: Wake him up, wake him up, wake him up.\nMARISHA: I instantly felt guilty, dick.\nTALIESIN: You guilted her up to another level.\nMARISHA: Yeah, you did. Okay.\nSAM: I would've done a cantrip.\nTRAVIS: Dick.\nLAURA: 2d8 plus ten? That's great.\nTRAVIS: Guilted it for an imaginary bear.\nTALIESIN: That's not bad.\nMARISHA: That's an eight and a seven plus ten.

{"prompt":"MARISHA: And (shattering sound).\nSAM: (gasps)\nTALIESIN: Oh, wow! We're going there.","response":"DM: Okay."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my god.","response":"DM: – you pull up, reach out, and pull this. And you're going to hold it in your hands, you could feel it's warm to the touch. Almost too hot to hold. And there's this slight pulsing, almost like a heartbeat pulse to it. You hold it in your hands and just crush it, concentrating all your energy on it. As you do, what seemed to be hard and sturdy all of a sudden turns brittle in your fingers, and it cracks and breaks, almost like it was made of a very, very brittle earth. As it breaks and your hands come together, the “too hot to touch” becomes too hot to touch, and for a moment, your hands burst into flames–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ah.","response":"DM: And you instinctively pull back like you want to go ahead and put out the fire–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ow!","response":"DM: – but then it falls to a normal temperature again, but the flames remain."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)","response":"DM: And you can now see your hands are now emitting flame from all the fingers."}

{"prompt":"SAM and TALIESIN: (sing) Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control.","response":"DM: You can see both of the tiger's claws embedded into the ground of this rocky terrain are having licks of fire and flame curling off of the actual claws."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hell, yeah. I look like an Ed Hardy tattoo.\nMARISHA: Well, I moved to Trinket.","response":"DM: Right, but you can break your movement up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, yeah.","response":"DM: You've moved 20 feet, so you still have ten more feet to move if you want to."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'll start heading to try and flank him. To flank the blue beastie.\nLIAM: Okay, Vax drops low. I click the boots of haste together, and for everyone who keeps asking, if I click my boots of haste together, I then get to attack three times. I get that question about three times a week. So that's how I do it. So, I click the boots of haste together, and then I'm going to crouch low and scoot. No, the other side of Minxie, and I should be able to go 60 feet without a problem all the way past the fucker.","response":"DM: Mm-hm?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, keep going, as far as I can. That's as far as I can go?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So– First is a–\nTALIESIN: I love that die.\nLIAM: Two, three, 24?","response":"DM: 24 hits."}

Two, seven, is nine, plus– Ooh.\nLAURA: Ooh, oh no.\nLIAM: This is 13, 17, 19, 20, 26, 31 for the first.\nTRAVIS: Jesus.\nLIAM: Second attack go. Oh, that's not the right die at all. Second attack goes. Same. Eee, 23?\nLIAM: Okay. And this is–","response":"DM: Regular damage now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah yeah yeah. That's seven?\nLIAM: And then the last dagger, the keen dagger, stabs him in the butt again, and that is–\nLAURA: Ow.\nLIAM: Ow, 16.","response":"DM: 16. That does not hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Whiff!","response":"DM: You actually go with a third one. The first one stabs through, and you can see you've actually hit some sort of an internal organ as you pull back and starts gouting blood. You see that, you stab a second blade in the same area and tend to open the wound another inch, inch and a half. The third one, you pull back, but it slinks around over its shoulder, its long sinewy neck curling over and staring at you. And your blade catches the hide instead and streaks off of the scales."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, hi.","response":"DM: That'll end your turn. Scanlan, you're up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I have to heal Trinket anymore?\nLAURA: No, he's okay.\nLAURA: We want to hurt him!\nTRAVIS: Do what you're going to do.\nLAURA: Do what you do.\nTALIESIN: You hurt feelings.\nMARISHA: You do you, Scanlan.\nSAM: Okay. I'll do some Bigby Hand.\nSAM: I summon Bigby's Hand. (sings) Bigby's Hand!","response":"DM: This giant spectral hand, sparkling arcane energy appears roughly in front of your space."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's in front of me. I can't make it go in front of him?","response":"DM: You can."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.","response":"DM: Like, I'm just saying, from a flavor standpoint."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Well then, I do one of these, the Sugar Ray Leonard. I do this–\nSAM: And then I throw my other hand forward.\nSAM: And I'll just punch him in the face.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Right? Because I can do the– It says huge or smaller creature, at least with Grasping Hand. Is that only– does that count?","response":"DM: Right. Oh. You can just punch something with it, no matter its size, to do damage."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Good try, Scanlan.","response":"DM: That's good."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Vax sees it fly over his head, and watches it pass.\nSAM: I'll take a step to my left, so I'm not in the same line of fire as Percy.\nSAM: And I'll also inspire Grog.

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: With the Sharpshooter feat.","response":"DM: Okay, so yeah. Because it would have partial cover right now, but you ignore that with the–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have Sharpshooter, so I can ignore cover.","response":"DM: Good to know."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, so. But I'm going to be taking a negative for these hits. Still three attacks per–","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. Just making sure I'm doing this right.","response":"DM: But you have to reload after this turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: Oh no."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Misfire?\nTALIESIN: Misfire.\n(all groan)","response":"DM: First shot. As you pull up to the side, you pull your pepperbox out and go to fire. As you do, you pull the trigger and the actual barrel sticks out the side. Spins off, and (ping-ping-ping) on the ground."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Fuck.","response":"DM: So that's your attack."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Balls.","response":"DM: That's your turn because it'll take you the rest of the turn to collect the Bad News."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Just say, “Your soul is forfeit,” just for coolness.\nTALIESIN: This normally doesn't happen to me. I don't quite know what–\nTRAVIS: It happens to all guys sometimes.\nTALIESIN: So can I, at least, use my bonus to pick up the pieces and–","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to pick up the pieces and–","response":"DM: You collect Pepperbox and you pull your back up to it and mutter curses."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.\nLIAM: Make sure you grab your dignity as well.\nTALIESIN: I'm just going to leave that as an open target for a little while.","response":"DM: Fair enough. Okay. Now, on its turn–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh shit.\nLAURA: Oh no.","response":"DM: First off, let's see here."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Damn it, attack attack!","response":"DM: But that does not recharge its Lightning Breath. It's going to move here. It's going to go ahead and make two attacks. It's going to turn around and its head that's looking at you, now, after you stabbed it in the back."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Reaches down, its giant jaws open. You can see, like, this thick saliva that's coating its fangs, and it, with serpentine speed, bites at you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hey, rogue's Evasion.","response":"DM: That's going to be a 23 to hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So, Uncanny Dodge, I can dodge for half damage, so it was a what to hit?","response":"DM: 23."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 23 hits, but I take half damage.\nLAURA: (as Vax) Half damage.","response":"DM: So, let's see. That would be–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yesh.\nMARISHA: Does a bite attack–\nLIAM: Half. Not whole.\nLAURA: (as Vax) Half damage.\nLIAM: 152 hit points.\nTRAVIS: Stop rolling, Jesus.\nLIAM: Ah, nothing.\nLAURA: Okay, okay.\nTALIESIN: Ain't nothing.\nLAURA: Don't say that's nothing.","response":"DM: Points of piercing damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't say that's nothing.","response":"DM: And then, as it bites, it turns around and its tail begins to snake around your body, Grog."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)","response":"DM: And its whole body begins to try to reach around to constrict and crush you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh shit.\nLAURA: What?","response":"DM: That is a 21 to hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That hits.\nTRAVIS: Halved.","response":"DM: So that'd be 11 points of bludgeoning damage plus 21 points of slashing damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Whoa.\nTRAVIS: Halved.","response":"DM: As well. So a total of 22 damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay.","response":"DM: And you are considered grappled and restrained, currently, as the entire creature begins to wrap around you. And you're currently (sound of struggle). You're trying to hold onto your axe but your whole body's being crushed by this large serpentine creature."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You piece of shit.","response":"DM: You feel every pulse of its muscles tensing. As the pain and ache, you can feel muscles and ligaments tearing and popping as it pulls in on you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Not cool.","response":"DM: And it's going to, as part of its grapple, move you with it to there. And it'll end its turn. Vex, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. How does the Hide thing work? Do I hide at the beginning of the turn or at the end of the turn?","response":"DM: At the end of the turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. I'm going to move out.","response":"DM: Okay, it has a reach of ten. So you are technically within its melee range. So you can run but you'll take attack of opportunity from it if you do. Just so you're aware."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I still arrow it from where I am?","response":"DM: You can, but you have disadvantage on all your ranged attacks because you are in melee range."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does it cancel out because I'm in the mountains?","response":"DM: Doesn't affect your attacks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Damn it.","response":"DM: Sorry. It's up to you, you can stay where you are and take disadvantage on all your attacks, or you could run past and it gets a free swipe on you. Your call."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to try to back up.","response":"DM: Okay. Over to here? Like, how far?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no. Wait, I can't see. I forgot my glasses.","response":"DM: Okay, you're right here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Uh-huh.","response":"DM: You can try and back up this way if you wanted to get away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, I'll try to back up towards, who is that?","response":"DM: That's Scanlan there. Oh, here?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Percy? I'll try to back towards Percy.","response":"DM: Right there?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: Over here?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sure, yeah. Why not?\nSAM: What's Trinket doing?\nLAURA: Well, Trinket's healed, and he's going to come with me.","response":"DM: Okay. So Trinket gets up and used half its 40 movement. It can move–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Although he's angry about it, because he wants to fight, but I just won't let him right now.","response":"DM: Okay, so as you rush away, the creature takes– Ooh, that's a 26 to hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Aw, Jesus. Really?\nSAM: Oh shit, does it hit Trinket, too?\nLAURA: No, just me.\nMARISHA: 26.\nLAURA: Trinket was too far away.","response":"DM: So you take 18 points of piercing damage. Oh, it's 3d10, sorry."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, yay!","response":"DM: 19 points of piercing damage as its mouth lashes out, takes a chunk of your shoulder for a second, and you wrench yourself away and keep running."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh.","response":"DM: Take the rest of your turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh, okay. I'm going to shoot him.","response":"DM: Yes, you are."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. That is 22.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. 14 for the first hit.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Second one is through the blazing bow, at 22.","response":"DM: Second one hits, first one misses, or did it hit?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no, 14 was the damage to it.\nLAURA: And then, (noises).\nSAM: (noises)\nLAURA: (noises) Ugh. 16.\nLAURA: Oh, and I hide.","response":"DM: You currently are completely in its visual range. You have to be behind something to reasonably become hidden."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm hiding behind–\nTALIESIN: But you are behind me.\nLAURA: Percy.","response":"DM: No, behind a person doesn't work. It has to be, like, behind a pillar."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Human shield.","response":"DM: Or in deep shadow."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (groans) Oh.","response":"DM: Something that would break your line of sight to it–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Like me.","response":"DM: For a moment, to the point where it no longer knows quite where you are."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It works.\nTALIESIN: It totally works.\nLAURA: I hid in the wrong place.\nSAM: Who said that? Who said that?\nLAURA: I went to the wrong place.","response":"DM: But now you know."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's okay. Next time I know.\nTALIESIN: Putting glass for the dog–","response":"DM: That's your turn. Grog, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would like to try and break the grapple.\nTRAVIS: 20.","response":"DM: 20, yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can picture that. Why did you do that?","response":"DM: Because you are restrained–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Kicking myself.","response":"DM: Need to check what effect the condition– Here. Just to be safe. Okay, yeah. Go ahead and you're making an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Natural 20.\nTRAVIS: Oh, that was good.\nTRAVIS: I bite its tail.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nLAURA: You can.\nTRAVIS: Son of a bitch! Ahhh!","response":"DM: As your teeth sink into one of its scales and you yank it out with the sheer force of your muscly neck."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Throw it over my way. I'll catch it.","response":"DM: It unfurls for a second, you manage to pull yourself out of its grasp."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm so pissed that I broke free, that I would like to use Intimidating Presence on this creature.\nTRAVIS: Is it?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: I reserve Intimidating Presence–","response":"DM: For a later time."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I hit the shit out of it.","response":"DM: You gain another attack, go for it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay, 21.","response":"DM: 21 does hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, I get one more.\nLAURA: Ha ha! Also 22.\nTRAVIS: Also 22.","response":"DM: “Hit” meaning–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You hit once.","response":"DM: It was one better than your previous–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, got you.","response":"DM: You hit once, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.\nTRAVIS and MATT: Just one hit.\nSAM: Just keep rolling 22s.\nLAURA: Just keep rolling.\nTRAVIS: Nine, ten, 11, 12. 15.","response":"DM: 15 points."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: With fire damage!\nTRAVIS: Bitch.","response":"DM: To emanate from the impact. It shrinks back for a second and (growls)."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You grabbed me. You ask first.\nTALIESIN: This is a repair die.\nMARISHA: I'm going to do my Bite and Claw attacks.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to move in that crux a little bit more, one more, if I can?\nMARISHA: Beautiful. I'm going to do my claw attacks first.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: To see what they– what it does.","response":"DM: What was it?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It was cocked.\nSAM: It was halfway between two.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So that's 12, plus, it's always different. Okay, 20.","response":"DM: 20 hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.\nMARISHA: I haven't been Minxie in battle for a while, 1d10 plus five.\nLAURA: Plus your flaming claws.\nLAURA: Don't forget your flaming claws.\nLIAM: She's got the plan.\nMARISHA: Yeah, six, so 11 damage for the claws.","response":"DM: An additional 1d6 fire damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Plus 1d6, oh wait that's actually– What did I just say? I said ten, 11? And then an extra 1d6?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ooh, another four, so what did I say?\nSAM: 15.","response":"DM: So, any of your claw attacks or any claw attacks you do in any of your forms now get an additional 1d6 fire damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Nice!\nTRAVIS: Hell yeah!\nSAM: Nice!\nMARISHA: Then I'm going to do my bite attack.\nLAURA: I know, it was really loud!\nTRAVIS: It was a good one.\nMARISHA: 16, so plus– 20, plus my six, plus seven, so 24.","response":"DM: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage for the bite."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Which is 2d6. Eight plus five, so 12.","response":"DM: Eight plus five is 13."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 13, 14! Plus, I get an extra damage for my collar, so 14.","response":"DM: Right. Cool. So, your flaming claw strikes across its outer body, its legs pull away from the pain as you reach up and bite into the edge of its tail. As its tail tries to whip away, you catch it and it pulls you forward a few feet as you clench down on it. Eventually, it yanks its way out, taking a couple of scales with it, you can see a streak where teeth marks are on the back of its tail."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (growls)","response":"DM: Awesome. Does that end your turn?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Nice, Minxie!\nMARISHA: (growls)","response":"DM: Tiberius is going to go around the corner again and is going to cast Telekinesis and send his glaive up spinning."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Glaive?\nSAM: He has a glaive?\nLAURA: The thing that he killed the old lady with.\nSAM: Oh!\nLIAM: It's the granny grinder!\nMARISHA and MATT: Granny grinder?!\nTRAVIS: So bad.","response":"DM: Rolls a two, unfortunately, though. Just streaks off and spins back around and then, while it misses the creature and stops, hovering above his head with a slow spin. Sits there curling his fingers, grinning at the creature. And is going to the use of the rest of this movement to go back behind the rock because mama didn't raise no fool. Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's preoccupied, so I just leisurely walk backwards about 30 feet, looking at the same wound that I started before.","response":"DM: This way?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, back up the chasm here. Even further away. Yeah! And I'm just going to throw three daggers into the wound I already hit, so I'm going to do that again. I know that hits because it hit the last time. That's a 23.","response":"DM: That hits!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And that's Sneak Attack because he's occupied. That's 11 plus–\nLAURA: Ooh, those are good!\nLIAM: 11 plus 17, 21, 26, 29, 34, 39 for the first dagger.\nSAM: What, that's just the first dagger?!\nLAURA: Yeah!\nMARISHA: Whoa!","response":"DM: Sneak Attack, man."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Next one doesn't hit, probably, that's a 17.","response":"DM: 17 just barely hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just barely hits, yeah! That is an eight of damage. And just wait a second and go– and throw it. And because I was such a cock it misses, that's a 16.","response":"DM: So, oh, perfect! Second dagger wedges in with the second dagger, opening the wound even more. You're like, perfect opening! You go for the third one, and it's grown wise to it, and turns around and rakes its claw out and deflects the dagger midair."}

{"prompt":"SAM: Oh! This is unusual.\nMARISHA: A turn.\nSAM: I still have my Bigby's Hand up, so I do one of these where I say, oh, a wise guy, see? (taunting noises) and I just poke him in the eyes.\nSAM: 19.","response":"DM: So, you get to go ahead and–"}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's the eyes!\nLAURA: Into the eyeballs!\nSAM: 19.","response":"DM: 19 points of force damage as you jam both its fingers into the sides of its head. Both of its eyes recoil on it, it reaches out and starts thrashing at the air around as the hand dodges around for a minute."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I hide behind Trinket, the smell of smoldering fur in my nose. As a bonus action, I will– who's up next, who's coming soon? Is Percy next?\nTALIESIN: I'm up next.\nSAM: I'll inspire Percy. Just doing this move–\nMARISHA: Sexy dance.\nSAM: Going, pour some Scanlan on you! When you need a hand! That's all I've got.\nTALIESIN: Ugh!\nSAM: And I get closer. Pour some Scanlan on you!","response":"DM: You begrudgingly take 1d10 inspiration dice from Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is the creature blinded from the pokey-poke?","response":"DM: It is not. It is a resilient creature, and the impact was mainly absorbed by the ocular sockets, as opposed to the eyes themselves."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hey, I didn't ask for science. Jesus.\nSAM: Do I lose another spell for that, or is that just the same–?","response":"DM: No, you can maintain concentration."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.\nTALIESIN: I hit a 12, which is just barely enough to fix it.","response":"DM: Okay. So you take your action to go ahead and repair the gun."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And I'm going to burn an Action Surge, so I'm just– I finally get it, and it just starts going. And I'm just going to empty out the chamber.\nTALIESIN: Ho, nelly.","response":"DM: Using your bonus action to reload."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I got my finger on the trigger, I got my finger on the trigger, gun!\nTALIESIN: I don't have to reload, yet, I've got six shots, so we're still three in the chamber.","response":"DM: That's right. We– yeah, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Unless you, actually–","response":"DM: As part of the misfire, you would lose one, so you have two in the chamber right now."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have two in the chamber?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, so I'll do two, and then use the third one to reload.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Pew, pew.\nLAURA: (high-pitched) Pew, pew.\nSAM: Don't shoot me.\nTALIESIN: Sharpshooter shot. That's 22.","response":"DM: 22 hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Nice.\nTALIESIN: I'll just take the second shot right now. That's– really? Really? Really, are we going there?\nLAURA: Oh, no.\nSAM: Did he misfire again?\nMARISHA: No, you didn't misfire, did you?","response":"DM: What'd you roll?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Misfired again. I rolled a two.\nLAURA: No.\nTALIESIN: I got one shot off.","response":"DM: You got one shot off. Go ahead and roll damage. Sharpshooter damage, so it gets the plus ten damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.\nMARISHA: That's fun.\nLAURA: Could you have added inspiration dice to that?\nTALIESIN: To a misfire? No.","response":"DM: No, misfire still hits. There is a lot of strengths to the gunslinger. This is the one penalty, is if you roll bad."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So that's, okay, at least this is a badass, as I at least did some damage. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24 damage, plus four points of fire damage.","response":"DM: Nice. Okay. So, as you go, and you fix it– It takes the first shot, with a burst of flame that shoots out the front of the barrel. The second shot, this time, the actual metal in the front arcs upward, and it looks like this is going to take a moment, to really seriously repair it. Pepperbox is coming through pretty rough in this fight."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, no. Oh no.","response":"DM: So that's your turn."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: But not as rough as Stitch over there, huh?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're in a group.\nLIAM: Right.\nTALIESIN: Oh, I was about to say, and–","response":"DM: So you wanna move anywhere?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, I wanna get a little further back. I wanna roll to the other side of the cave again, if possible.","response":"DM: Which way? You mean over here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah. Like, see that little outcropping of rock?","response":"DM: Right here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Further back. Like that over there.\nMARISHA: That little chunky thing?","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Smart move, Percy.\nTALIESIN: That thing scares me.\nLAURA: Why are you abandoning me?","response":"DM: Okay. That ends Percy's turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The beast.\nMARISHA: I don't like the dice that I have.\nTRAVIS: Don't think too hard.\nTALIESIN: That's not good.\nSAM: No.\nLAURA: It just burps out lightning.\nTRAVIS: Jesus, I don't think we've ever seen anything this hard.\nLAURA: I know.\nLIAM: Guys, guys.\nSAM: What is he doing?\nLIAM: Guys.\nMARISHA: Have you seen anything like it?\nSAM: What is he doing?\nLIAM: Guys.\nLAURA: He's thinking.\nLIAM: Guys.\nSAM: We broke the DM.\nLAURA: I know.\nTRAVIS: You know the silence before the storm?","response":"DM: Considering optimal–"}

You get an attack of opportunity on it, Keyleth. So go ahead and take a swing."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Burn it.\nSAM: Fire slap!\nMARISHA: So. 16.","response":"DM: 16 just misses. It gets right out of your grasp. The flames just lick across the outside of its scales. As it pulls back, rears down right in your face, Godzilla-style, just unleashes a burst of electrical energy."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, God. Dodge it. Dodge it.","response":"DM: It hits you and Keyleth. I need you guys to both make dexterity saving throws."}
{"prompt":"SAM: With inspiration.\nMARISHA: Who, me and Grog? Okay.\nSAM: With inspiration.\nTRAVIS: I don't need it.\nSAM: Okay.\nMARISHA: Dexterity saves? That's not good.\nTRAVIS: 19.\nMARISHA: Four.","response":"DM: 33 points of lightning damage to you, Grog. 66 to you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I use my Stone's Endurance?","response":"DM: You can."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm now in Keyleth form.","response":"DM: And how much damage goes over?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Not that many, thank God. 12.","response":"DM: 12. Okay, so you– As Minxie all of a sudden gets blasted, you can see the form shrink down to Keyleth's crumpled form on the ground, hands still flaming, little bit of singe to the back of her hair, and stands back up."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll take that. I'll take that.\nLAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: That'll end its turn. Vex, you're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That felt like Shockwave.\nLAURA: Oh, God. Can I, as a bonus action, give Trinket a healing potion?","response":"DM: You can– that would be more of an action to feed it to something else."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, never mind. I am going to attack it.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. He's, oh, I missed. That's a 14.","response":"DM: A 14 does not hit, unfortunately. The first arrow just ricochets and shatters across the part of its body."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Great. Good times, good times. 16. Both miss. Fucking A. What a waste.","response":"DM: Both arrows just explode across its hide. It's too thick."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This dice is out for the rest of the game. I'm gonna run. Is there an outcropping where we are? I can't see.","response":"DM: Right here, a little bit. If you pull fully in on this side from where it–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to pull fully in on that side.","response":"DM: Okay. Don't forget your laser pointers, by the way, guys. It's good for letting me know exactly where you want to go."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I can't see.","response":"DM: I know. Just so you know. And Trinket's going to stay there?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's gonna rest. And he's going to keep protecting Scanlan, because–\nSAM: Oh, thank you. Giant gnome?","response":"DM: Giant hand, small gnome. Grog, you're up."}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's a 18.","response":"DM: 18. That hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 21.","response":"DM: 21 hits."}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'd like to reach up with my firebrand warhammer.\nSAM: Yes!\nTRAVIS: And I would like to smash it on top of its skull, and when it hits the ground, I'd just like to keep turning it into jelly and paste and sweet jams that I can bottle it up and sell later!","response":"DM: You guys watch this continuous barrage, this horrible bludgeoning. Every impact almost quakes the inside of this valley. Rocks are beginning to tumble and fall around it. And you can see, as each horrible, sickening smack, its head just collapses more and more.

Didn't it come out of a cave, when we saw it?","response":"DM: You saw it was up on a higher platform, you didn't see a cavern, or anything."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I thought it was a cave.\nMARISHA: I rolled a 21 to collect goods.","response":"DM: Okay, looking through the book that you have. You eventually take a while to look while you guys are having your short rest. You can use your hit dice to heal yourself. It is known as a behir."}

These creatures are difficult to harvest and a lot of their locations are unknown. A lot of them were hunted down for that long ago and almost thought to have gone extinct."}
{"prompt":"(all groan)","response":"DM: However, yes, you don't know anybody, possibly Karin in Emon. The hide can be harvested. There is also a gland in its throat that it uses to charge its Lightning Breath."}

It's steep, you slide down a few times. But eventually, because there's no immediate threat, you're given time to get up onto this upper platform. You can see that there are these various parts of the rock that jut outward, that have some short term passageways that this creature uses."}

You take time and with help from some other folks, you manage to harvest, I'd say about ten pounds worth of scales at most. It's not a whole lot. A lot of it has been torn and destroyed from the impact and damage you guys did. Parts of it are not really armory functional, but you manage to get enough to maybe make one set if somebody manages to work really well with it."}

You will not be able to use your hit dice for healing on this, because you spend your time harvesting instead.

You don't know how much it's worth. Probably a decent amount, as the book says that they're rare. Especially to find intact."}

The mountain range here is a large part of the material that is mined, well, was mined beneath the– It's very rare white quartz-like rock that is used for many purposes.

When I poo somewhere, I can see everything.\nLAURA: I didn't poo. I'm sensing with my mind.\nTRAVIS: Listen, if we do run across a dragon, remember we have the dragon slayer longsword, which is a plus one to attack and damage rolls, and if you hit a dragon or a dragon creature, it gets an extra 3d6 of damage.\nLAURA: What are you reading? How did you even know that?\nTALIESIN: That's the most complicated sentence I think I've ever heard you speak.\nTRAVIS: Sorry, I blacked out for a little bit.\nTALIESIN: Nothing.\nLAURA: Nothing. You're good, Grog.\nTRAVIS: What do you have to do to attunement?","response":"DM: Attunement, you take a short rest with the weapon, learning its properties."}

They're not small.\nLAURA: (gasps) You are seriously. What?\nTALIESIN: Wow.\nLAURA: That's disgusting.\nTRAVIS: I missed it. It must be good, though.\nSAM: She usually buries them quite well.\nLAURA: Really gross, both of you.

So Whitestone's to the east?","response":"DM: Whitestone would be to the east of you guys."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, okay. I thought we went up the eastern side of the mountains. I'm so confused. You wouldn't think I'd lived here before.","response":"DM: That would have brought you through the forest, and you were trying to avoid that. That's what I thought you said last time."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, that's very true. Oh, god.\nTRAVIS: West side's on the shore side, right? Ocean's there?","response":"DM: There's a giant peninsula to the north. Either side would have been coast."}

As you guys are walking forward and you're seeing this, and you're keeping back, Grog, you instinctively look over and go, oh. That's a stone giant fortress."}

This is obviously a stone giant fortress."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, and I drank some of that nasty dank in the fight with the Hammer, round two.\nSAM: Wait, should we– those are bad guys, right?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, that's bad.\nSAM: We should not go that way.\nLAURA: We should definitely stay away from that.\nTRAVIS: Maybe go up on the other side of the chasm opposite of it?","response":"DM: Or you can move around the side, you're welcome to."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: No, I don't want to bring any attention.\nMARISHA: I could create a diversion.\nSAM: What kind?\nLAURA: Like what?\nMARISHA: I mean, I could– What's nearby? Is anything nearby? Any animals? Have we seen any wildlife?","response":"DM: There have been birds that fly through, an occasional harpy, in the distance you hear screeching and you guys keep quiet until it vanishes and disappears."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Wow.\nTRAVIS: That was perfect timing!\nLAURA: How'd that happen? How did that frickin' happen?\nTRAVIS: His ways are mysterious, my love.\nLAURA: You are magic.","response":"DM: I am lucky."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Holy cow.","response":"DM: What were some seafaring like seagulls and various coastal birds have slowly been disappearing and turning into more eagles and hawks, things that eat small rodents, more of a lush side of the hill. You see as you get closer to the valley itself that the actual forest that surrounds Whitestone is more and more of these birds of prey are beginning to show up. Other than that, you see very few small things other than occasional lizards about that big in your hand that live on hot rocks."}

Perhaps?\nLAURA: Is it movable?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, it can't move with us.\nMARISHA: It could block their view of us.\nLIAM: Can you make some shrubs to come along with us?","response":"DM: You guys actually used it previously to camp for a night along a cliffside."}

Adding what?\nTRAVIS: Fuck yeah! Nipple tits.","response":"DM: You have advantage, you add your strength modifier. Or your athletics is what it would be."}

You make your way around and you can see this large fortress that is built out of extremely large and in-place stones and stonework. It looks ancient. For size-wise, it's two stories for a giant, which means it's probably close to six or seven stories of height."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Whoa.","response":"DM: Built into the side of a mountain, and it goes down almost like two giant steps. It's built on essentially where the giant bowl, the caldera if you will, of where this valley of this mountain range would be. It's built on the inside of it, so it's actually constructed, as you continue to descend into the valley. Looking at it, you can see openings, windows, there are areas up top where you see giant piles of rocks and boulders that are used for anti-siege, for throwing off the top, stockpiles of that. You do see boulders around the ground that may have been thrown and not picked up. Everyone make a perception check."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: With an athletics check?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does he get an advantage because of mountains?\nMARISHA: I love that he says 'roll your dice' like it matters.","response":"DM: Nope. He gets disadvantage because he's a big bear."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Strength modifier? He got a 15, too.","response":"DM: Okay. It's been difficult, and it slowed your guys' progression, but you've managed to keep Trinket along with you; this large bear is now like pushing against the side.

The two  front doors, you see these two large stone doors that are the entrance to it. One of the doors is actually broken in half and left partially ajar and open."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We gotta go in now.\nLAURA: No, no, no.\nSAM: They could be dead in there.\nLAURA: If something could've taken out giant giants. What could it be that could've done that?\nTRAVIS: Vampire giants.\nTALIESIN: It could've been the Briarwoods. We should see everything that's up here.\nSAM: (sings) There are giants in the sky.\nTRAVIS: How awesome would that be?\nLAURA: (sings) There are big, tall, terrible giants in the sky.\nTRAVIS: Can we please go see? Can someone please–\nSAM: You want me to go in?\nTRAVIS: Vax!?\nMARISHA: I can bird it. I can bird it and go in.\nTALIESIN: I can't believe I'm about to say this.\nMARISHA: Bird in and do a recon mission real quick?\nSAM: You're going to bird in? They're going to see you fly in.\nLAURA: No, but she's a bird.\nMARISHA: I'm a bird.\nSAM: It doesn't matter, they're still gonna see you.\nLAURA: Recon it.\nMARISHA: I'll go bat!\nLAURA: Yeah!\nTALIESIN: Now you're not going to be able to see anything because they have terrible eyesight.\nMARISHA: Not in a small–\nTALIESIN: I'm kidding, they really don't. That's a myth! That's actually a myth!\nMARISHA: They have echo vision!\nTALIESIN: They have actually very reasonable eyesight. That's a myth. You can look it up on Wikipedia, it's true.\nLIAM: You could also be a sparrow.\nLAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: So, at about the two in the afternoon day sun, 'cause that's what it is. But you're fine. You become a bat–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Bats come out during the day!","response":"DM: I know. She makes her way, down through; you swoop up to one of the windows and you glance inside and look around. You can see most of the furniture inside is in tatters. There are large, giant-sized tables and chairs that have been broken in half and strewn across the room. Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh, come on, Keyleth!\nSAM: Come on, oh yeah.\nTALIESIN: Oh yeah!\nMARISHA: Oh yeah! 28.","response":"DM: 28. Glancing inside you also see there are–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (squawks) That's my echovision.","response":"DM: – splatters and puddles of blood. Large bits of blood across the ground that is dried, but from your current vision from this, there is no sign of any living or individuals or bodies. There was a battle that took place here, but there is nothing present to signify who or what."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How big is this room?","response":"DM: This room is about 25 feet tall"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Does it look like it goes deeper?","response":"DM: It does look like it goes deeper, there is a slight– this is the upper floor, there is a grade, almost like a slow– the word escapes me for a second."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Like a downgrade.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Like a ramp.","response":"DM: A ramp!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: A slope.","response":"DM: Thank you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A siggle.\nMARISHA: I'm gonna go into that–\nTRAVIS: Careful. Oh no no no no! Don't roll! Don't roll!\n(all shout)\nTALIESIN: We turn on him.\nMARISHA: Fear of god.\nLIAM: Grog sacrifices the gnome.","response":"DM: So yeah, you do see the ramp, that's downward."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to go into the room that I see is for sure empty, and go toward the threshold of the ramp.\nMARISHA: Like it's been ransacked, or just a really nasty fight?","response":"DM: Like some sort of a major fight went down. No sign of any bodies or body parts. No sign of leftover weapons or armor from whatever giants lived in here. You just see large amounts of dried blood across the stone floors."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I tell if the blood looks– how dusty is this shit?","response":"DM: Did you want to land and make an investigation check?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Call us in.\nTRAVIS: Do it.\nLIAM: Do it, Batwoman.\nTALIESIN: You are the night.\nMARISHA: How much dust goes pff?","response":"DM: Quite a bit; a little puff."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: Not a huge amount, but enough where it's not fresh, and a closer look, the blood's been dry for a while. Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What is the sound of a bat coughing?\nMARISHA: (squawking and coughing noise)\nTALIESIN: Thank you. It's the simple things.\nTRAVIS: What did you get?\nMARISHA: Investigation. What about a 12?","response":"DM: 12. You can't really make it out, unfortunately. You know it's dried, it's been a little bit, but you can't quite gauge how long it's been."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You said seven stories, so it's like room, downgrade, room, downgrade, room?","response":"DM: Seven stories for your size, it's two stories for a giant size. It's a large top room, and a large bottom room."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh.\nMARISHA: Is there another room going off the bottom room?","response":"DM: There are just two rooms: top floor, bottom floor. You're currently on the top floor, looking down."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Split level condo.\nMARISHA: I'm gonna go out to the front door.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah, let's go check in.\nTALIESIN: Let's check it out.\nSAM: Oh!\nLAURA: Ooh.\nTRAVIS: Really?","response":"DM: So it's not like it was beaten in, it was beaten from the inside out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: And there is a streak of dried blood against that portion of the door. Looking inside too, you see there are a large cluster of matted hides and furs, like it made for bedding for close to four or five giants put in the corner, and there is a musty smell of whatever they were using to make it comfortable and ripe for their own personal needs."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Stealth!\nLAURA: Yeah, yeah, let's stealth.\nTRAVIS: Can giants become vampires?\nLAURA: I don't know, I hope not. You should use the dust of tracelessness, Grog, just so our footsteps aren't seen.\nLIAM: 17.","response":"DM: 17, okay. So what do you guys want to do in here?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Stealth.\nSAM: I'm going to go downstairs.\nMARISHA: How dark is it?","response":"DM: You are downstairs at the entrance"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh. Down the grade, I mean.\nTRAVIS: I want to look for any weapons that are lying about.\nLIAM: I want to ransack the joint.","response":"DM: Actually, it'd be more of an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Me, investigate? That's funny. Eight.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Investigate or perception for me?\nTRAVIS: I find dirt.","response":"DM: You find a giant's fortress."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Investigate or perception?","response":"DM: For this? Perception is just seeing things at first glance. Investigation is going through and rummaging through to find things."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll investigate.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Shall I for downstairs?","response":"DM: Yeah, go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 17.\nSAM: 23.","response":"DM: Okay. As you guys are going through, looking at the blood and the way the splashes are, the blood that was spilled here was very thick, and large amounts of it, and it's probably been anywhere from two to three months since this entire fortress was ransacked."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Wow.","response":"DM: You do notice that some of the blood is dragged through, like something was dragged out of the puddle. But not for a long distance. Whatever was there was cleaned off at some point, or lifted up and carried out from whatever was originally pulled through those puddles of blood. You also do notice that in the pile of furs and refuse and there are bones of things that were left there to rot in the corner. You find roughly 120 gold pieces."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I give it to Vex.","response":"DM: Over time you find a number of shattered glass vials that look like they once contained various elixirs, there is one that is unshattered."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I take it.\nLAURA: (gasps) What is that?! What is it? What did you find?\nSAM: Nothing, nothing.\nLAURA: What is it? What is that?\nLIAM: Here you go\nLAURA: Ah, what is this?\nLIAM: What are you going to do with it?\nLAURA: What is this?\nSAM: I'll use it as a hammock.\nLIAM: Shoot yourself?\nMARISHA: Does it look like it's magic-y?\nLAURA: Can I tell what it is?","response":"DM: Taking it, it appears to have some sort of magical radiance to it. It looks like it's very well crafted. You recognize the construction is elvish in nature."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hey, look at this.","response":"DM: And there are bits of mithril scrolling all throughout the bow itself, with platinum caps on the edge of the longbow."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is it evil?\nLAURA: I don't know. Keyleth, do you know anything about magic-y stuff? Tiberius bamfed out.\nMARISHA: I can try, I'm not as good as he is, but I'll try.\nLAURA: What about you, Scanlan? Do you know anything about arcana?\nMARISHA: Ooh, 20!","response":"DM: Natural 20?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, 18; 20 total.","response":"DM: Yes, this is definitively a magical item, it is enchanted."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's definitely magical.","response":"DM: If you want to take a short time to work with it and attune yourself to it, you could get a better idea of what its effect is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Thank you. Can we do that?\nTALIESIN: I'm going to look around a bit more, anyway.\nLAURA: I'm going to think about it real hard.\nLIAM: Probably shoot a couple dummy arrows out of it.\nTRAVIS: Can I walk out the front door?\nLAURA: I'm going to buy it a steak and I'm going to–\nTRAVIS: Can I walk out the front door and keep post on the porch?\nLIAM: I'm following Grog and I'm doing the same.\nTRAVIS: And I want to look in the direction we want to be walking.\nTALIESIN: I'm looking around, I'm trying to find out what happened to the bodies.","response":"DM: Investigation check for that. Here are the potion and the bow you guys managed to–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What is it, what is it?\nSAM: I took the potion, I took the potion!\nTALIESIN: I know, apparently, from this roll that I'm in the mountains.\nLAURA: What is it?\nTALIESIN: I got a six.","response":"DM: A six. It's hard to tell. It's a very strange scene, and you have no inclination as to what may have transpired here. Who is the winner, who is the loser, and what has been done with the bodies."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sorry.\nMARISHA: What did you find, what did you find?\nTALIESIN: Vex is making happy noises.\nLIAM: She's taking the bow for a spin.\nTRAVIS: She's attuning.\nLIAM: Seeing what it can do.\nTRAVIS: Do we see anything outside on the porch?","response":"DM: Over time the only thing you catch is occasionally you see flocks of birds moving through and swooping through the area. You watch one flock come up and begin circling a little bit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should we get out? Should we leave?","response":"DM: And then make its way down toward the valley."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Stealth.\nLAURA: Just leave. Let's leave. Stealth it out? Stealthy out-ie?","response":"DM: This is for Grog who is outside, roll a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm out there too, and I rolled a natural 20.","response":"DM: Yes you did."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I might use your inspiration on this.\nSAM: It's probably not in effect anymore.\nLAURA: (groans) No, you're in the mountains!\nTRAVIS: I am in the mountains.","response":"DM: Which means you have knowledge of mountains."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You don't get advantage?\nTRAVIS: I don't have advantage on–","response":"DM: Let me double-check on this, actually, what the specifics of the goliath's– You don't take issues with cold climates, because you're at high elevation. You don't actually get advantage on anything mountain-wise; that is a ranger ability."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So can I add an inspiration on this?\nSAM: I inspired him quite a while ago. How long does that–","response":"DM: It's been a while, how long does that last?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 20 minutes?","response":"DM: Yeah, that would've faded by now."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's a one.","response":"DM: Oh, well, if it's a natural one it wouldn't have mattered."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, it doesn't matter, you can't add shit to one.","response":"DM: So while you sneak off to the side, you see these birds. There's a lot of birds there! You start yelling out to everyone, there's a lot of birds out here! Shouting it loudly back into the fortress."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Aw, shit.\nMARISHA: Grog, Grog, those might be centurion birds!\nTRAVIS: (loudly) That's what I said, birds!\nMARISHA: They might be spies! They might be spies.\nTRAVIS: (loudly) Yeah, I spy birds, they're flying everywhere. (yells) Go away!\nLAURA: Grog, Grog, inside.\nMARISHA: Inside!","response":"DM: The birds immediately start circling the fortress very close. You can hear the screeching. You can see the birds now, they're crows. A very, very thick murder of crows, probably close to a hundred of them, cawing."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace.\nMARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.\nSAM: I'm still down there, investigating.","response":"DM: Mm-hm."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I pull a David Caruso and say, It looks like these giants had… big trouble.","response":"DM: You hear an echoing sound, yeahhhh! Formless, sourceless. You all stand there confused for a moment, then continue to try and stealth."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I run back inside.","response":"DM: Back inside. Eventually the crows take back to their original path."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, oh, but before the crows leave, before the crows leave–\nLIAM: Yeah?\nLAURA: Yeah?\nMARISHA: Can I do something?","response":"DM: Yep. What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do it!\nTRAVIS: Do it!\nSAM: Kill them all.\nMARISHA: I'm gonna go like Storm and I'm gonna Sleet Storm them. I'm gonna start conjuring a Sleet Storm over the top of this mountain, right where the crows are.\nTALIESIN: It's been so long since you've killed something innocent! Let's bring it!\nLAURA: Do it, do it, Keyleth!","response":"DM: As Keyleth concentrates for a second, you see her eyes, the actual color of her irises, begin to fade to this cloudy white and then the entire eye itself becomes this icy blue. A slight cold mist beginning to drift off the corners of her face."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Badass.","response":"DM: You start hearing this pounding sound on the top of the fortress as sleet and hail begins to rain down. Go ahead and roll damage for the spell."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, jeez.","response":"DM: Sleet Storm? Oh, it's just a dexterity saving throw. It says heavily obscured, but doesn't actually do any damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But it knocks them all down.\nMARISHA: I know, they're like frozen though, right? Don't they get frozen with Sleet Storm?","response":"DM: Sleet Storm knocks things prone, makes the area hard to see."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Knocks them prone","response":"DM: Douses flames."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: They're in the sky, I wanna hear birds hit the floor.","response":"DM: And a few do. There are a few birds that get pelted and knocked to the ground, encased in sleet, but most of it immediately takes note to get away from the storm and vanish and disappear back to–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do they fall to the porch?","response":"DM: I'll say one does."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I run out there and I grab it.\nLAURA: No, no, no!\nTRAVIS: I rip its head off with my teeth.","response":"DM: Grog, you run out there and grab the one on the ground, it's struggling, and (squawks), there's ice gathered everywhere."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, shut up!","response":"DM: You grab it and you pick it up, you hear Vex go “Grog!” and you go (chomp) as she's staring at you. Silencing the crow. You hear the cawing of the crows dissipate in the distance and silence eventually takes the fortress once again, and you're left amongst the smell of death."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should get the eff out of here.\nMARISHA: I think so.\nTALIESIN: We should probably leave.\nLAURA: Now. Stealth and out.\nLAURA: Dust of tracelessness. Hide ourselves.\nTRAVIS: Dust of tracelessness.","response":"DM: You make your way out of the fortress and begin to follow the path down into the outside of the forest and just as you make towards the base of the mountains where the forest canopy begins to take your vision, you can see just over the edge, a couple of small castle towers and what looks to be a single central spire of the castle of Whitestone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They know we're here now. They know we're here.\nLIAM: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: I think they might.\nLAURA: That was a sentry.\nTRAVIS: Why? They were just birds.\nMARISHA: Yeah, but we don't know–\nSAM: Don't worry, we still have the element of surprise. Oh wait, no, we don't.\nLAURA: Oh yeah!","response":"DM: Let us begin where we left off."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, we're looking at the city.\nSAM: There's the city! Shall we storm it?\nTALIESIN: It's a chalkboard.\nLAURA: I was pointing at you!\nTALIESIN: Well yes, so I can now recognize where we are.","response":"DM: Yes, you know this area very well. This entire forested area, the Parchwood Forest that encompases the entirety of this valley, toward the center of it, center north, is where Whitestone sits and for your reference as well, since you've been here before, you would know the city relatively well."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Maps!\nTALIESIN: This is the most exciting map I've ever been handed. Whoa!\nLAURA: What the what?!","response":"DM: Hold that over by your seat there for people to take a look at."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Don't. Just don't.\nTALIESIN: It won't fit in my folder.","response":"DM: That is a basic rundown of the size, design and shape of Whitestone, with Castle Whitestone toward the top, built on top of a leveled off mountain that marks the southernmost point."}
{"prompt":"SAM: This is the castle, this is the town?\nTRAVIS: And we're at the southern part of that?","response":"DM: You guys are actually coming in from what would be the northwestern side of the city"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So over here?","response":"DM: A little bit further down. About that angle there. That's the direction you're coming in from."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's a detailed map, man.","response":"DM: I don't have any free time anymore."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: They sell those stock, right?","response":"DM: Oh yeah, totally."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What's this little outcropping?","response":"DM: The little outcropping to the east of it was the graveyard to Whitestone. It's where most of the regular denizens were interred. It's been expanded over the years as the city itself has been around for quite a few generations."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Does this graveyard have catacombs? Tombs? Underground passages?","response":"DM: Do you ask this of Percy?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes.\nTALIESIN: Does it?","response":"DM: That graveyard does not–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That graveyard does not–","response":"DM: – it is a surface graveyard."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: – it is a surface graveyard.","response":"DM: There is a mausoleum–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: There is a mausoleum–","response":"DM: – but that–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: – but that–","response":"DM: – is actually contained beneath the castle."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: – is actually contained beneath the castle.\nTRAVIS: Riveting.\nSAM: So knowledgeable, Percy.\nLAURA: So Percy, do you know of any secret passages to get actually into the castle?\nTALIESIN: I was wondering that myself.","response":"DM: There is one, one that you took to escape."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes, there is one!","response":"DM: He has an aneurysm. Yeah, it is to the very western edge of the mountain precipice the castle was built on. It was built to be specifically an escape in case the place was under siege. Unfortunately, the circumstances that the evening happened so rapidly, and with creatures that seemingly were unnatural, the family didn't have time to make it out. And even you weren't fully aware of it. Cassandra, however, had overheard discussions about the passage and took that as your escape route. It's a hidden tunnel at the very base of the mountain."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I say we scope out the hidden entrance, see if it's guarded, see if they've discovered it.\nSAM: To the town, or to the castle?\nTALIESIN: The hidden entrance to the castle. Instead of using it, I think we should possibly spend the night and get a view of the town, see if there's anything unusual.\nLAURA: I agree, can we camp out and hide?\nSAM: Watch from afar? What's that going to tell us?\nTRAVIS: We could send one in.\nTALIESIN: We could send a bird in. Or an invisible gnome.\nSAM: Or both.\nTALIESIN: Or both. An invisible bird-gnome.\nTRAVIS: Just to see if the town is normal or not.\nSAM: It could be all vampires. Or it could be a totally normal town.\nTALIESIN: If it's all vampires, it'll be empty right now.\nSAM and LAURA: Because it's daytime.\nMARISHA: We should do a fly-by.\nLAURA: We should definitely attack during the day.\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nTRAVIS: We should send one by air and one by land.\nLAURA: What?\nMARISHA: Do you want to do that?\nSAM: How far away are we?","response":"DM: You guys have been travelling through the forest, and it is a very dense forest, but it is mostly cold-weather trees, pines. And there is, you can see once you get inside the forest, the ground itself is very thick and there are elements of melting snow on the top of the trees, there was recently a snowfall in this area but it seems like it's been a while and most of it has turned to slush and water. You have about two hours of travel into the forest, and you all immediately catch the sound of distant howling."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is it nighttime?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh. That's scary.\nMARISHA: Distant howling? Does it sound like wolves? Can I make a nature check?","response":"DM: Yeah, make a nature check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Stealth?","response":"DM: If you want to make a stealth check"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 26.","response":"DM: 26. Those are wolves. It sounds like a pack of wolves, probably close to anywhere from five or six."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Would I think it's weird that they're howling during the daytime?","response":"DM: You gather that it is strange that they're out. Though it is getting later in the day, you are pushing four or five in the afternoon, the sun is starting to get closer to the horizon. It is strange that they're out this early, you're not sure what the reasoning would be for that."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Odd.\nTALIESIN: I say we hide in the trees.\nLAURA: Up high.\nTRAVIS: Like up in the trees?\nLAURA: I like it.\nTRAVIS: We're gonna climb some trees.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're gonna Hobbit this shit.\nSAM: We're just hiding in the trees, we're not going in to investigate?\nTALIESIN: Well, it's about to be nighttime, so we'll send a scout.\nSAM: How long would it take to get into the town from where we are?","response":"DM: About two more hours of travel."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How long would it take me to fly over if I was a bird?","response":"DM: About an hour."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Vax.\nLIAM: Yes?\nSAM: Can I ride you into town?\nLIAM: You want me to jog into town?\nMARISHA: You could ride me into town.\nSAM: Well hello lady.\nMARISHA: Man, every time, Scanlan, every time.\nTALIESIN: Now that just got weird.\nLAURA: Could you turn yourself and fly?\nSAM: Yeah, I guess I could fly.\nMARISHA: You wanna go invisible and jump on my back and I can eagle up?\nLAURA: Ridiculous.\nMARISHA: Let's do it.\nLIAM: If the coach driver was any indication, there are going to be people–\nLAURA: Normal people.\nLIAM: – in town.\nSAM: What about this: I'll make us both invisible and you fly us in.\nLAURA: I like it.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, get on the ground, not just above.\nSAM: Looking. Up to an hour. Ooh, and it takes two hours just to get there?","response":"DM: Well, flying takes an hour. So, it's one of those things you could do once you approach it. It'll last you awhile, as opposed to doing it now."}
{"prompt":"SAM: How long can you be Polymorphed for? Forever? Concentration?\nMARISHA: For half of my druid level, we discovered.","response":"DM: So somewhere around six hours, five hours."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, so you fly us in, and I'll Invisibility us right as we get to the gates.\nTRAVIS: And as they're going out, we get in the trees.\nTALIESIN: Make sure you bring an earpiece.\nMARISHA: He's got an earpiece.\nTRAVIS: Do we, the four of us, all go up in the trees?\nLIAM: Everyone get your own tree.\nLAURA: Everyone get your own tree?","response":"DM: Everyone who's in a tree, please roll a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Except for Trinket, who can't climb up.\nLAURA: Trinket can climb trees! Bears climb trees!","response":"DM: Roll an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm casting Pass Without a Trace. How long does it last?\nSAM: You have to roll for Trinket.\nLAURA: Okay, fine! I guess I'll cast it tonight, never mind.\nTRAVIS: Plus ten to stealth?\nLAURA: Why are you being a dick, Scanlan?","response":"DM: Well, she did not cast it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm not casting it yet.\nTRAVIS: 14.\nLAURA: What are we rolling?\nTRAVIS: Stealth.\nLIAM: I already did. Those are good rolls!\nLAURA: 21 for me, and what do I– just nothing. 19 for Trinket.","response":"DM: Okay. We'll say you guys all manage to slowly get yourself up into the tree the best you can, as you guys take off. While you guys are away, making your way towards Whitestone, the rest of you look down, and just from a passive perception standpoint, you pick up the most detail: you can see there is indeed a pack of about five wolves and/or dogs a little ways away, but they're being followed by one humanoid. They're being guided, there is a pack out here for some reason, whether it be a hunting party or whatever other reasons there may be. It isn't a wild pack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And they're close to us now?\nTRAVIS: I've been doing the dust of tracelessness.\nLAURA: So, I'll cast it on us now that they're closer.\nMARISHA: I wonder if that's the ground search party.\nLAURA: Maybe.\nTRAVIS: We'll see.\nLAURA: So, should we add ten to all of our stealth rolls that had been, or do we have to roll again?","response":"DM: You'd have to roll again."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shit balls.\nLIAM: So we're stealthing again in the tree?","response":"DM: Because she's casting Pass, or you won't get the benefit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm already at a 32, man!\nTRAVIS: I'll take it.\nLAURA: You don't have to.\nLIAM: Let's do it, let's roll again.\nTALIESIN: Let's roll again.\nLIAM: What do we add?\nLAURA: Ten to whatever we roll.","response":"DM: Go ahead and just add ten to the previous roll."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Good.\nMARISHA: We want to keep our good rolls.","response":"DM: So, about five breathless moments pass as the dogs, wolves all get relatively close. One of them comes up and returns back to the pack. You don't get a good view of the individual that is currently guiding the pack, and you see them disappear between the thick trees in the distance. Make an active perception check for you, Vex, if you don't mind."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Not advantage. Mountains?","response":"DM: Is forest? No, you're in forest, now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh wait! That's another!","response":"DM: You're sure that's a favored terrain? Then go ahead and roll again."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That was worse than the first one, that's great.","response":"DM: So your total is?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I rolled 20.\nLAURA: Okay, well, you didn't say you were doing it. 18.","response":"DM: 18, okay. It's hard to make out the details at this distance. You check out, it does appear to be a female form."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, it's a chick!","response":"DM: Best you can tell, you can't tell specific race or details. Then, another minute passes before the barking and the howls fade and the hunting party seems to have been eluded."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: There was no way to get a good look at who it was.","response":"DM: No. Do you want to make an active perception check?"}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Natural 20.\nTRAVIS: What?! Really?","response":"DM: A natural 20?!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm looking at it!\nTALIESIN: This is an 'I love you' for those awful rolls earlier.\nTRAVIS: The golden snitch wins again.\nTALIESIN: That may be its name now.","response":"DM: You see the female form, it's not someone you particularly recognize. But the woman does appear to be older, probably in her late 40s, early 50s. She has some hunting gear over her shoulder. She has a short bow that's strapped over her, she has a quiver of arrows. She looks like she's hunting for food."}
{"prompt":"SAM: If she was a little older, Tiberius would kill her.\nSAM: Give her ten years.","response":"DM: Give her ten years."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I don't recognize her, though?","response":"DM: No, you don't have an immediate lead of visual recognition. In the meantime, you guys make your way. Swooping down, you can see that cluster, that murder of crows circling out. It's making a large pass over this entire valley. You take this cue as you get to within visual range of the city to cast Invisibility on both of you. Is that a 3rd-level spell?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes.","response":"DM: Okay. Both of you vanish from view, which is a strange feeling for you because you cannot see Keyleth, you're grasping onto something you can't see."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, shit.","response":"DM: And you just look like you're gliding through the air."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I do one of these?","response":"DM: Yeah, you grab on very tightly."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (choking noises)","response":"DM: – without choking. The eagle does not have–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Damn it!","response":"DM: – human physiology. You get two fistfuls of feathers. And you really don't want an eagle to buck you angrily at this height. I don't think you have Featherfall so that wouldn't go well. Looking over Whitestone, you can see outside of the city there are some areas where the trees are carved out, and there is farmland set up specifically to grow food and to till to maintain sustenance for the people that live there. You can see that there's a small area that's also being cut for timber. Not a perpetual thing, but the wood here is, you've heard previously, one of the major exports here is very high-quality timber from this type of tree that is used for very exquisite woodcraft and furniture. So that's one of the major exports of Whitestone as well as the quartz from the mines itself. There are people in the city, but sparse. Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I also make a perception check?","response":"DM: You may."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: With my eagle vision?","response":"DM: (singsong) You may."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 14, so that's 24. And I have Keen Sight, which means I have advantage on all perception checks.","response":"DM: Yes, you do."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'll take that 14.\nTALIESIN: She'll take that 14.\nMARISHA: As opposed to that one.","response":"DM: Total of 14?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 24.","response":"DM: 24. Okay. As you get close enough to start scanning over details, you can see that a lot of the buildings appear to be closed or empty. There are people working in the fields. As you make your way to the center of the town, there is a town square. There is a tree there, a very large, old tree that is twisted, with all these various gnarled branches that reach out. You recall Desmond mentioning something called the Sun Tree that is the centerpiece of this area. And you get a view enough of the tree to see that there are eight humanoid bodies of varying ages swinging from it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ooh.\nLAURA: Oh no.","response":"DM: You also notice that, patrolling through the city at very slow paces, there are a few larger than normal humanoids."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)","response":"DM: You see what appear to be approximately six giants patrolling through the town, but you can see some of them are like wrecked and broken. One of them is missing an arm and is dragging a foot behind it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They're zombie giants?!","response":"DM: Apparently, whenever one of them is moving through, most of the denizens of the town keep a very wide berth, and generally avoid them entirely and go about their business, at a distance."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my god.\nLIAM: I miss Pike.\nTRAVIS: Six?\nSAM: No problem.","response":"DM: Like over all of the entire city. They're pretty well scattered about. After you do a full pass over the city, those are most of the details you can make out at this height. Anything further, any specifics, you want to go for before heading back?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You want to set me down so I can go talk to people?\nMARISHA: You want to talk to people?\nSAM: Well, or at least eavesdrop. We don't know if they're all vampires or not.\nMARISHA: Does it look like there's a central part where there's a lot of people gathered?","response":"DM: Farmlands look likely to be the largest cluster of people. You can see, since it's getting to the end of the day, there are folks finishing up gathering the crops that were available to them or sort of planting as they go through. And you can see there's about five or six people that are all in one group. Most everyone else seems to be relatively solitary and trying to go about their business as fast as possible."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The town square's emptying out?","response":"DM: The town square? Nobody is in the town square. People are avoiding it like the plague. There's eight bodies hanging from the tree, and nobody wants to be there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's just open and empty.","response":"DM: Yeah. You can go to a tree that's nearby, but that's like 300 feet away."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: A rooftop? A wall? Anything I can perch on?","response":"DM: There is a wall. There is a wall on the outskirts of Whitestone."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I perch on the wall.","response":"DM: Okay. You swoop down and you perch on the edge of the wall there. It's about 25 feet up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm just going to walk down there. I won't be able to see you, so I'm going to leave a little–\nMARISHA: I'll keep an– Oh, wait, I can't see you.","response":"DM: And you can't talk right now, you're an eagle."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I leave a little, like a canteen or something, right where she's perched, just so I know where to find her.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Smart.\nTALIESIN: Leave the mug.\nSAM: Yeah, my stein. And then I'm going to walk down and see if I can stealthily eavesdrop on some conversations.","response":"DM: Okay. You make your way down the 25-foot wall she's perched on."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, shit. Am I going to fall?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an athletics check to climb."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You say that out loud?\nSAM: Athletics?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 17.","response":"DM: 17. The stonework here is old and you manage to not lose your footing entirely as you bring your way down. Thankfully, you're light enough, and the stones are not too large, so you can get some good handholds. You do, over the next 12 minutes or so, make your way to the base of the wall."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It took me 12 minutes to climb 25 feet?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Nice. I suck.\nMARISHA: Maybe whistle for me when you come back.","response":"DM: A lot of moments of (gasps) 'whoa, okay'. But, you catch yourself. I mean, you can just jump if you wanted to make it less. But, the duration of your invisibility– you have about 20 more minutes before it dissipates."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh shit, I have to do this quick.","response":"DM: You look over the edge, and you can see that they have carts up and that they have what vegetables they have, and a lot of vegetables, even at a close look, a lot of them look withered. It looks like there is a general sense of frustration that the land itself is not producing quality crops. And even the people look unhealthy and gaunt by nature. Whether it be the cold winter recently or just their general spirit is broken, but there is a feeling about these people that life here is not what it used to be. There isn't a whole lot of conversation, there's mutterings here and there. “We have to make sure we get these back in time. Fill the cart, we have two carts we have \"to get in.” And the other one's, “I know, I know, I'm trying,” And they're putting it over there and there's a little bit of frustration among them."}
{"prompt":"SAM: He's doing walla.","response":"DM: One of them ends up counting the last bit of crop. “That's it, that's all we have. That is the \"entire pull for the day.” And the older gentleman, who is overseeing it, grinds his hands and goes, “Sir Kerrion is going to have my hide.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, wasn't that one of the people–","response":"DM: “At the very least, let's gather it together and hopefully Pelor will protect us.” And the people take the carts and begin making their way towards the outer gate on the southeast side of Whitestone, where you guys are currently at."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. I'm going to hustle back to the roof.\nSAM: Jesus.\nMARISHA: I can come get you.\nTALIESIN: You'll hear a thump.\nSAM: Eight.\nLIAM: Hopefully he lands on his lute.\nSAM: No, it's nine.","response":"DM: Okay. 15 minutes. After five minutes of eavesdropping you realize that you are not going to make it up that wall, and you feel the magic of your Invisibility illusion about to fade. At this point, by the way, the sun has just hit the edge of the mountains, the sky itself is a vibrant, reddish orange slowly turning to purple and sunset is upon you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I want to spend the night here. No.\nMARISHA: Can I see him?","response":"DM: He's invisible, no."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I will sneak around the corner a little bit, wait for an opening, and I lose Invisibility, which will drop it on her as well, and I will Dimension Door back up to the roof.","response":"DM: Okay. As you pass to the side, the illusion fades, you step into a small opening of dark, purplish energy and then reemerge on the top of the wall–"}
{"prompt":"MATT and SAM: Grab the canteen.","response":"DM: –and hop back on the back of her."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, shit. Invisibility again.","response":"DM: Okay. Okay. You guys vanish, and Keyleth, you take off back in the direction you guys traveled from. In the meantime, guys, what do you want to have been doing? Are you just waiting, are you traveling further in, are you staying where you are?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (snores)\nTALIESIN: We have to wait.\nLAURA: Yeah, keeping an ear out for the wolves and just chilling in a tree.\nTRAVIS: (yells) I fall out of the tree.\nLAURA: And also, I'm restringing my new, awesome bow.","response":"DM: With the–?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: With the blazing bowstring.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Which, by the way, is a longbow of sky sentinel.\nSAM: Sky sentinel, what does that mean?\nLAURA: Once per long rest, I can use a Storm Arrow, which means that the next arrow I fire splits into three arrows. Roll an attack for each of them, they all get 1d6 extra for each one that hits. It's amazing!\nSAM: Every time you use it, or is at a one-time–\nLAURA: It's one time per long rest.\nMARISHA: That's awesome!","response":"DM: Once per day, she fires an arrow and the arrow splits into three, and each one bursts into thunder damage, bursts of them."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Say what?! So, is it lightning damage or is it–","response":"DM: Thunder damage. It should say on there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It says lightning damage.","response":"DM: Oh, then it would be lightning damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's a taser arrow.\nTALIESIN: It's basically a taser.","response":"DM: So yeah, it's pretty fun."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thunder!\nLAURA: Thunder!","response":"DM: What's that from?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't know.","response":"DM: So, the night falls and the crickets begin to emerge, the slow mist begins to form."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait, our friends aren't back yet. It's already night and they're not back?\nLIAM: I just want to say that I pulled my hood down, and put on my calamari hat, and pulled the hood back over it.","response":"DM: Okay. So you take the partially rusted over, but functional, metallic skull cap that Clarota was wearing when you guys met in the Underdark, that Clarota no longer needs."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Because he's dead.","response":"DM: You place it on your head and it's a little loose. As you place it on, it rattles for a moment, and then it form-fits to your skull. Your hair being pinched beneath it and just emerging from underneath, almost Loki-helmet-style."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Looking snazzy, Vax.\nTRAVIS: Nice bonnet.\nSAM: (imitating Clarota) I'm on your head.","response":"DM: There's a weird buzzing vibrational feel as its magic attunes to you over the next hour or so as you're waiting, but you get the sensation that it will offer some decent protection from impeding charm effects."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It tingles.\nLAURA: It looks like you have a mullet.\nLIAM: Yeah, dude.","response":"DM: A Loki mullet. You start to get really nervous about the arrival of your friends, until eventually you hear the flapping of wings. You look up and you can see, since it has taken an hour to get there, the illusion just fades, both a giant eagle and Scanlan appear in the moonlight, right above the canopy of the forest you guys are close to, and return to the place you were."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Keyleth, question. Can you make it look like we're not here with your foliage shit?\nMARISHA: I drop my Beast Shape, holding onto a branch.\nLAURA: You know, the illusions.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: Good, good.\nLAURA: Can we camp up in the tree? So nobody can come towards us.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nSAM: What if we fall out?\nMARISHA: I Druidcraft some spiderweb hammocks.\nLAURA: Ooh.\nTALIESIN: Sticky.\nMARISHA: And, as usual, light some sage.","response":"DM: Takes about an hour or so, but you manage to pull from the surroundings these really nice, thick spider silk hammocks, that should be able to support your respective weights. Grog is the only one that might be questionable with the sheer amount of weight that is his form."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I like it.\nMARISHA: Maybe take a rope and tie it.\nTRAVIS: Nope, this is a trust exercise.\nLAURA: I'm using Hide in Plain Sight to make me and Trinket extra, extra hidey.\nLIAM: I have a question. The only reason I have this question is because I posted that video from a couple of years ago. Do I still have the unending rope?\nLAURA: I have the unending rope, motherfucker.\nLIAM: Why don't we reinforce with the rope?\nLAURA: Sure, why not.\nTRAVIS: You don't like the trust exercise?\nLAURA: That's where all the rope comes from that we ever use.\nLIAM: I'm sorry I brought it up. I'd love you to fall on your head.\nLAURA: Let's reinforce the spiderwebs.\nTRAVIS: No, I'm good, thank you.\nMARISHA: Whoa, Vax. Nice helmet. Don Quixote called.\nLIAM: Aerodynamic, isn't it?\nMARISHA: He wants his bowl back.\nSAM: Before we slumber, we did a little intel, a little recon.\nLAURA: Oh, yeah. What's up?\nSAM: Turns out the town is full of humans, except for these six vampire giants– zombie giants.\nMARISHA: They all appear to be fairly miserable people.\nSAM: However, this could be useful. Everyone in the town, the farmers anyway, seem to be gathering produce to deliver to the Briarwoods. We could pose as some sort of farmer troupe with a basket of goodies, and maybe get through the front gate.\nLAURA: Don't you think they would know all the farmers around at this point? They've been there for a long time.\nMARISHA: They did reference Sir Kerrion by name. Oh, they referenced Sir Kerrion, Percy.\nTALIESIN: Thank you.\nSAM: We could make ourselves look like some of them. One of us has a hat of disguise.\nMARISHA: Also, there was something other really important.\nSAM: What?\nMARISHA: The town was pretty much empty.\nSAM: Oh, yes, this.\nMARISHA: And that Sun Tree, that what's-his-name– Who said that? Jarett?","response":"DM: Desmond."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Desmond. Looks like there were some executions that took place. There were about eight bodies hanging from that tree.\nLAURA: Why is it called the Sun Tree?\nSAM: It's really lovely. I don't know, maybe it gets sun.\nMARISHA: I don't know. Why do they call it the Sun Tree?\nTALIESIN: Can I go with this? Unless you have a particular reason to–","response":"DM: I mean, you can go with– There are maybe many reasons it's called the Sun Tree."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: There's reasons. Maybe we need to battle them at the Sun Tree.\nTALIESIN: Legends say that before the castle was built, that the journey into the valley was treacherous and stormy, and the original builders of Whitecastle feared they would die. And this one, great tree stood in the valley, and it was underneath it that they took shelter. And as they began to take shelter, the storm broke. And the storm did not return until the castle was completed.\nSAM: That's a lovely story.\nTALIESIN: We hold our festivals there every year.\nSAM: And now it's being used as a–\nTALIESIN: As a gallow, yes.\nLAURA: Does it get a lot of sun?","response":"DM: You do know, and this ties into your story as well, because the guidance in forging the city of Whitestone, that tree was representative to them as a guardian of Pelor, the god of the sun. The protector of light, holiness–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Who that?\nTALIESIN: A very serious god.\nTRAVIS: That could help.\nLAURA: That could help us, because vampires hate the sun.\nSAM: Why would they make camp in the place where the god of the sun–\nLAURA: Maybe that's why they're hanging bodies from it, to taint it.\nLIAM: Maybe that's why it's protected. Maybe–\nSAM: Are any of us religious with that god, or–?\nMARISHA: Can we call Pike through your magic poo?\nLAURA: Would she be able to hear us?\nTALIESIN: Tablet of Apple?\nSAM: I can at least see what she is up to.\nLIAM: Keyleth, would you be able to revive the tree?\nLAURA: (gasps) Bring it back.\nSAM: What would that do?\nMARISHA: Yeah, I can, actually.\nLAURA: I don't know. Bring up the god of the sun again, I don't know.\nSAM: We're not religious people. We can't summon the gods willy-nilly.\nLIAM: We can please Pelor.\nLAURA: Don't tell us what we can and can't do, Scanlan.\nSAM: I'm sorry. We can do all of those things. Yes, let's go in the middle of the vampire-infested town and do some arbory to try to heal the tree, and then we'll just say, oh, sun god, please rain down sun here.\nLAURA: I like it. Let's do it.\nSAM: That's a great plan.\nTRAVIS: Can we at least try cutting down the bodies and running, and seeing what happens?\nSAM: We could.\nTALIESIN: I say, in the morning we take a look at the passage, see how well-guarded it is. And if it looks dangerous, sneak our way into the town. If people are not enthralled, if they are being forced to work, then maybe we can find some allies.\nMARISHA: Find allies in the town?\nTALIESIN: I don't think they're happy.\nLAURA: I think they're terrified. And I don't want to let them know we're here, for fear they'll turn us in, in hopes of saving their own necks.\nMARISHA: That's what I'm thinking. Yes, they're terrified, but this whole town's being ruled by fear.\nLIAM: I have a feeling we can revive that tree somehow. It may weaken the Briarwoods' hold on the psyche of the villagers here.\nLAURA: This is true! It could help out. Let them know the god of the sun is on their side.\nTRAVIS: I heard you're supposed to pee on a lemon tree, so.\nLAURA: Probably you and Scanlan are on that, I have a feeling.\nTRAVIS: Can I make a nature check to see if that's true?\nTALIESIN: I really wanted to ask. What does peeing on a lemon tree have to do with anything?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 19! That's 17.","response":"DM: In your experience with the roving band of barbarians, you guys enjoyed very much peeing on very colorful trees, of all sorts of plant life. All of them, generally, didn't seem to, over time, react well to the process, whether it be the fact that you all drank a lot of the time, so the content of your urine was probably not very hospitable."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's known as a lemon party.","response":"DM: That's a whole different kind of festival."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You killed Percy.\nLAURA: You killed Percy.\nTALIESIN: Thank you for bringing the text chat all the way back around.\nTRAVIS: Operation tree rescue.","response":"DM: The lemon party is held on the far, far southern continent of Tubgirl, the region of Goatse."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I have an idea. Should we wait until the sun comes up, create a distraction, so all the undead giants come looking, and then we have someone go cut the bodies off the tree, and–\nLAURA: And bring it back to life!\nTRAVIS: – let Keyleth give it a little love.\nMARISHA: And then what happens after that?\nLAURA: Then we get the fuck out.\nSAM: Won't they know we're here? Won't the people see us doing things?\nMARISHA: I know. I feel that's the equivalent of putting dish soap in the fountain on prom night.\nLAURA: No! Didn't you say that all around the Sun Tree nobody's there?\nMARISHA: Yeah, we did that. What?\nLAURA: Didn't you say nobody's around the Sun Tree?\nSAM: That's true. But we still have to get in.\nLAURA: We'll fly up and over. You just did the same thing.\nSAM: I know, I know.\nLAURA: Fly up and over, land, bring the tree back to life, get out.\nSAM: Are you sure you don't want me to be a carriage driver, and you'll hide in the hay of my carriage and I'll go straight up to the Briarwoods.\nLAURA: I feel like they know all the townspeople.\nSAM: I will put on my hat of disguise, I will be someone completely different.\nTRAVIS: They can see through that.\nLIAM: I'm telling you, they looked right through me.\nLAURA: When he was invisible!\nLIAM: Invisible. They saw me.\nLAURA: They probably saw you!\nSAM: So while he was transparent, they saw through him?\nLIAM: No, but I was heavily stealthed.\nLAURA: No, you were invisible.\nMARISHA: Oh, wow!","response":"DM: No, the invisibility faded when he attacked the guard."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: When I beaned the guard. They should not have been able to see me.\nSAM: I'm not talking about getting past the Briarwoods. I'm talking about getting past the guards that guard their castle.\nMARISHA: Here's another issue. It's going to take me a minute to do the tree.\nLAURA: How long?\nMARISHA: It might take a bit.\nLAURA: How long's a bit?\nMARISHA: Well, I mean, it's one of those things where the longer I do it the better it'll be. I can do it for up to eight hours.\nTRAVIS: Oh, shit.\nMARISHA: If I do it for up to eight hours, I enrich the land over half a mile radius, centered on a single point, and the land becomes enriched for a solid year.\nLAURA: I don't want to enrich all of the–\nLIAM: Question.

Here's the thing. I don't know if you want to get all the crops all fancy, because it'll just feed the Briarwoods. Maybe just do the tree area, which will be like two hours, maybe.\nMARISHA: Yeah? I think if I have a solid hour or two hours with it.\nSAM: Once the tree is healed, we have no one of religious power to summon any god.

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A which?","response":"DM: A religion check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: A witch?","response":"DM: A witch."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 16.","response":"DM: 16? Okay. Pelor is the god of the sun and agriculture. It's a good deity and is generally worshipped by farmers and simple folk and people that live off the land, and generally it's the most nature-based deity of the main spectrum, outside of Melora, which is the deity of nature."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh. Well, dope! Would I know stuff like that too, then?","response":"DM: You know of Pelor, yeah. There are elements of Pelor's following that bleeds into your druidic nature, though you don't necessarily follow a deity."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Totally.","response":"DM: You are not a religious man by nature, and you know that there is a strong following of Pelor in the town. The entire graveyard that you talked about earlier, that one is largely built around the imagery of Pelor.

Maybe, while I'm meditating, I can somehow reach out to her, and maybe ask her to get in touch with Sarenrae, and maybe Sarenrae can call up her homeboy Pelor.\nLAURA: Do you think that works?\nMARISHA: I don't know.\nTRAVIS: This is like phone a friend?\nMARISHA: We're not organized religion people, we Ashari.\nLIAM: The tree is called the Sun Tree. It's Pelor's tree. I'm not a cleric of Sarenrae, but these shitbags could not have set up camp in a temple of Sarenrae because there is too much goodness there, as there was around this tree in this town, and it's why it is dead. It's why it's being surrounded by a bunch of giant undead things, as you described. You need faith, Scanlan Shorthalt.\nSAM: Me? I am the antithesis of faith.\nLIAM: Then you need to shut up and let us fix that tree.\nSAM: And then what?\nTRAVIS: Who knows?\nSAM: We're going to fight off a million monsters to heal a tree, and then we're going to say, “Okay. Bring out the sun,” or something.\nMARISHA: Hang on! What did you just say?\nTALIESIN: What?\nMARISHA: That thing you just said that no one heard because we were all shouting and arguing? Rally the townsfolk?\nTALIESIN: Rally the townsfolk. This is something I think– I don't think that sneaking in is necessarily the answer. I'm not saying go in, guns blazing, but I say we let them know–\nMARISHA: You want to build a militia?\nTALIESIN: I want to build a rebellion.\nLAURA: I like it. They would recognize you, wouldn't they, Percy?\nTALIESIN: I have a plan.\nTRAVIS: You have a plan?\nSAM: Does it involve healing the tree?\nTALIESIN: It does.\nLIAM: I don't think there is any sneaking in, thanks to those birds, so we make a stand out here.\nTRAVIS: Tell us your plan.\nTALIESIN: My plan is, we do our best to sneak in, we find cover. Obviously, you said there's abandoned buildings. We find cover. We heal the tree. I have some other ideas. We take those zombie giants out one by one, quietly.\nSAM: We're going to be insurgents?\nTRAVIS: Shh! Let him finish the plan!\nSAM: I kind of love this.\nTALIESIN: Okay.\nMARISHA: It's like Attack on Titan. That's cool!\nTALIESIN: Let's start finding our friends, and we start making friends. We let them know we're back.\nLAURA: I like it.\nMARISHA: I like having the people. It feels less like we're the United States.\nTRAVIS: Okay, where do we start?\nTALIESIN: I have some parchment.

{"prompt":"LIAM: At once.\nTRAVIS: Fucking gravity.","response":"DM: You manage to complete three pieces of parchment, roughly page-sized, with your black powder treatment, successfully. The mist rolls in and gets thicker and thicker, to the point where you cannot see the floor of the forest. The little bit of moonlight that manages to make its way through the boughs of the trees trickles through and then vanishes into these slowly-shifting bits of fog. Your breath, every time you exhale, is visible, as the cold night air begins to take. You find yourselves instinctively shivering, as you cannot grow close to each other for heat, nor build a fire. The night, while uncomfortable, you do manage to get an evening's bit of mostly uncomfortable rest, but rest nonetheless. Eventually coming to as the morning sun comes up and heats it up, the fog begins to fade away and burn away. You're at about an hour past sunrise as you all unrestfully come to consciousness as the temperature shift hits. You manage to relieve yourselves of your spider silk-based hammocks and/or tree grasping. Both you and Trinket have found this way of clutching onto the tree. Trinket's used to the wild."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: This is, like, sunup, right?","response":"DM: It's about seven, 7:30 in the morning."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I do a quick scry back to the poo jar that I left back in our kitchen?","response":"DM: Certainly."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Just to make sure that our home base is okay.","response":"DM: You take a moment and concentrate on the kitchen. At this point in time, you can see early morning. Laina is currently in there, yawning, and is cleaning about and starting to make a small breakfast for all the guards. You can hear in the distance, some conversation in the distant room. It appears to be a couple of your various employed mercenaries having a conversation as she's making breakfast."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So they're fine.","response":"DM: They seem fine."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So I knock that one off, and I'll try for Pike.","response":"DM: Okay. Concentrating on Pike– about two minutes of hard concentration. There's no connection."}
{"prompt":"SAM: They wiped my poo away.","response":"DM: You gather, due to the relatively fresh and unstable nature of this potion you had concocted, you can only have one source connection up at a time, so when you left it in your keep, it seems that the one you had at the temple of Sarenrae was alleviated of its magical presence. What was once a magical scry poo is literally just Scan-scat at the temple."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Which some could argue is magical in its own right.","response":"DM: Sure enough. With a high enough persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Teacher. Teacher.\nTALIESIN: Does it change color when it loses its power?","response":"DM: You don't know."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Damn it! I want to know.\nSAM: Only one way to find out.\nTALIESIN: God damn it.\nTALIESIN: Your poo power may come in very handy. This is good to know.\nTRAVIS: Let's go find an abandoned building and set up.\nLIAM: Could we throw in a Scanlan grenade and be able to see through it?\nSAM: Sure.\nTALIESIN: A scat grenade.\nLIAM: A scat grenade.\nSAM: Sure.\nLIAM: Scatlan.\nMARISHA and TALIESIN: Scatlan!\nSAM: I could get in, shit in their bedroom, and leave.\nLIAM: You shit in your hand, and you toss it.\nSAM: Oh, yeah. That, too! Pull the pin.\nLAURA: Yeah. Remember that. That's awesome.\nTRAVIS: This is what happens.\nLAURA: You could fly overhead with Keyleth.\nSAM: Yes?\nLAURA: Drop it like a bomb!\nSAM: And then we'd have eyes in there.\nLAURA: I like it.\nSAM: I like this a lot. Give me something to eat.\nMARISHA: What?\nSAM: I need some fuel.\nTRAVIS: Holy crap.\nLAURA: I have a sweet potato right here, Scanlan.\nSAM: Sweet potato? That's good, yes. Some prunes?\nMARISHA: Yeah, something hearty.\nTRAVIS: Step one of this.","response":"DM: So, you make your way down into the forest. About another hour and a half of travel before you start getting to where the trees begin to clear up a little bit, and you can see the base of the cleared-off mountain that Whitestone Castle is built upon, and the pathway that descends into the outer wall of the city of Whitestone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How far of a travel is it down into the city?","response":"DM: It's maybe a quarter mile."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So we can do that a little amount of time.","response":"DM: Space-relation-wise, you guys are just getting to this side of the forest right there. Right there, and this is the mountain."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So if we're going to try stealth this shit in–\nTRAVIS: Do we take the stealthy one or the invisible one?\nSAM: Wait.\nMARISHA: Wait. Wait. Which plan are we doing first?\nTRAVIS: First part is getting an abandoned building.\nLAURA: So that we can be near the tree to protect you.\nSAM: So that we can be townspeople.\nMARISHA: Okay.\nSAM: Right?\nTALIESIN: So you can get a beret.\nTRAVIS: Abandoned building, part one.\nSAM: We're setting up shop.\nLAURA: Get into the town.\nTRAVIS: So who goes and finds the abandoned building?\nSAM: Percy is known here.\nTALIESIN: Which is why I'm going to be wearing– I haven't been seen in years, and when I was seen, I was much younger, and honestly–\nMARISHA: Yes, but the Briarwoods knew who you were.\nTALIESIN: I had different hair. Yes, they do.\nMARISHA: The Briarwoods recognized you instantly.\nTALIESIN: They did, which was disorienting.\nSAM: But they're not on sentry duty.\nTRAVIS: We need a forward operating base, so who wants to be stealthy or invisible and find an empty building?\nLIAM: Question: for the Assassin path of rogue, at 9th level, if I have seven days, which is way too much time, I can impersonate anyone I want. In half a day, could I just be a dirty nobody?","response":"DM: Yeah. You'd be able to disguise yourself."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We also have the hat.","response":"DM: The disguise kit?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: His hat of disguise. Percy knows this town. Perhaps Percy should wear the hat.\nTRAVIS: Does it require attunement?\nSAM: Just a few minutes, I think.\nTALIESIN: I already have the hat.\nSAM: Yes, you had it from the dinner party.\nTALIESIN: I've been trying to think of what sorts of buildings would be the most defensible and the least likely to arouse suspicion. Things with basements?","response":"DM: A lot of the houses have basements. There are varying degrees of it. There are larger homesteads that were reserved for the actual nobles that ran the day-to-day life of Whitestone when your family was in power. As you heard from Desmond, probably the places where the new nobles live. Those are the ones that have the gates surrounding them: the larger homesteads scattered throughout the town."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's too obvious.","response":"DM: It's far too obvious. There are many small abodes and even some farm-based hovels. The poor end of town is the farming side, which is the southwest, which is the closest area to where you guys made your stop earlier."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I would almost say a shopping district. If there's an abandoned storefront.","response":"DM: The shopping district is the center of town around the town square."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Around the Sun Tree?","response":"DM: Yeah. Right there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Might be too close.\nSAM: Before we go marching in there, finding an abode to live in is not going to be too difficult. We'll need food.\nLAURA: Are we living in there?!\nSAM: Yes.\nTALIESIN: We're not going to be there for long.\nTRAVIS: We have dried food rations.\nTALIESIN: We have food rations. We have options.\nLAURA: We've got food for days.\nSAM: We might be there for days and days.\nLAURA: We've got food for days.\nTRAVIS: We've got dried food rations.\nSAM: We also have to go around town and, forgive me if I'm going too far with your plan here, but aren't we trying to win allies among the people?\nTALIESIN: I have a plan.\nSAM: But we'll need to communicate with them. How?\nLAURA: He has a plan.\nTRAVIS: He has a plan.\nTRAVIS: Come on. Drop your pants and get with the plan.\nMARISHA: What time is it? Have we gone to sleep, or are we waking up?","response":"DM: You guys are awake. After this discussion, I'd say it's about 8:00 in the morning. 8:30."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's make our way in.\nLIAM: This is the time.\nLAURA: We should stealth in.\nMARISHA: Are we doing the tree thing right now?","response":"DM: Actually, your travel to the city and you're on the outskirts of it now. It would be closer to 9:30."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nLAURA: Yeah. We try to get in.\nTALIESIN: We find a place to at least set up our operation.\nMARISHA: Well, that's what I was going to say. Do we want to find operations, try and recoup–\nLIAM: We don't really know what we're going to find this morning. Those big guys could still be there; we don't know.\nTALIESIN: We don't.\nLIAM: We don't know if there are people in the pocket of the Briarwoods here.\nTRAVIS: It's like 12% of a plan.\nMARISHA: If we take a day to get in and get settled, I can do a Heroes' Feast and then I start crack of dawn in the morning?\nLIAM: I think that's a good idea.\nTALIESIN: Let's get in and set up.\nLIAM: Hole up. Let's find a place.\nSAM: Wait, we're just going to walk into the city?\nTALIESIN: No, we're going to stealth into the city.\nSAM: Okay.\nLAURA: We're going to cast Pass Without a Trace on everybody.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Beard check?\nTRAVIS: That was an eight.","response":"DM: Stealth?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Beard check.\nTRAVIS: Amazing.\nLIAM: You would be a freak.\nTRAVIS: Is it like that Vidal Sassoon commercial? Whip it.\nMARISHA: That's dope.\nTALIESIN: Isn't that dope?\nSAM: Grog, I've heard that no one in this town wears a beard.\nLAURA: Oh, natural 20 on stealth!\nTRAVIS: You can forget it. I won't go in.","response":"DM: So you guys are traveling as a group. I need stealth checks from everybody."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do we have Pass Without a Trace?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Can we each take a little bit of time to look more like commoners?\nTALIESIN: I'm wearing my hat, too.\nTRAVIS: Look like commoners?\nSAM: I rub dirt all over my face.\nTRAVIS: Shit, I'm a goliath.\nLAURA: Plus, we have a bear.\nSAM: You should try to look less handsome.\nMARISHA: Yeah, we do look like quite the motley crew.\nLIAM: I'm wearing a natural 20.\nSAM: Okay.","response":"DM: Did you roll a natural 20, as well?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I did.","response":"DM: Both of you guys rolled natural 20s in stealth?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Had a little help with Luck, but I got it.","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's really good, because I rolled a one.\nLAURA: Oh no.\nSAM: We've got Pass Without a Trace, so 28.\nTALIESIN: 11.\nMARISHA: Still a failure.\nTRAVIS: Are we all going together? Are we not sending one person in to go find an empty building?\nSAM: We're all going together.","response":"DM: You guys are all going together. You dirty yourselves up a bit. You're still a large goliath. You're still a few half-elves, a gnome."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: There's still a bear.","response":"DM: Outside of illusion magic, you're still going to stick out like a sore thumb."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Could we cast illusion magic? Do we have it?\nSAM: What's illusion magic?\nLIAM: I'm walking 50 feet in front of everybody else.\nLAURA: Seeming! To make Grog and Trinket look like commoners.\nLIAM: I'm 50 feet in front of everyone else.\nLAURA: Yeah, do that!\nMARISHA: Oh, yeah! Seeming us?","response":"DM: This is a legit use of Seeming, too. Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We'll all look like dirty–\nMARISHA: As opposed to the cows? Come on.\nSAM: – dirty, ragged peasants.","response":"DM: Trinket, as well?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.\nTALIESIN: Trinket looks like a donkey.\nLAURA: No, he'll just be a really drunk peasant.\nMARISHA: A donkey. A mule.\nSAM: Can I just say this? Can we just leave Trinket behind–\nLAURA: No!\nSAM: I don't want to walk in there with a bear!\nLAURA: He'll look like a fucking donkey, or he'll look like another commoner.\nSAM: I think I can only make us all look the same.\nLAURA: Then he'll look like a fucking commoner.","response":"DM: Of similar size. I believe, as far as Seeming is concerned– If not, then I'll allow it for the purposes of this."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He'll look like a commoner–\nMARISHA: A Clydesdale!\nLAURA: – a weird commoner.\nTRAVIS: Leave the bear.\nTALIESIN: A milk cow!\nLAURA: I'm not leaving a fucking bear on the outside of town where there's hounds around, and there's fucking vampires and birds flying around, fuck you!\nSAM: Oh, wait, no! You can give each target a new appearance.","response":"DM: Yep!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: So I can make everyone look a little different.","response":"DM: Each creature can seem a foot shorter or taller, or appear thin, fat, or in between."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Make him look like a milk cow.","response":"DM: You can't change their body type. So, Trinket will still be a four-legged creature, but you can make him look like a different four-legged creature."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: There you go!\nSAM: Okay. He's a milk cow.\nLIAM: Real talk, real talk, Scanlan. My sister will cut you.\nTRAVIS: Or do you want him to be a donkey, something we can move. Milk cows are slow.\nLIAM: Bring the bear.\nTALIESIN: Donkeys can move more quickly. This is true.\nSAM: He's an ass.\nTRAVIS: Just like her owner.","response":"DM: The rest of you are a smattering of various humanoids, you–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (fake coughing)\nSAM: I make myself look like a weird hunchback, sort of, not all there.","response":"DM: Okay, so you guys look like pretty rough peasants, dirty faces. You know, hair a little razzled. It looks like you've been living the harsh life on the outskirts of the slums of Whitestone for quite some time–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I wanted to be a model.","response":"DM: – with a donkey."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (goat bleat)","response":"DM: So. You guys, utilizing your stealth checks and the Seeming, you make your way up to the– which side of Whitestone are you coming in from?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Thank you for the double 20.","response":"DM: Percy?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where are we coming up?\nTALIESIN: Coming in from the west.","response":"DM: Okay, so you come into this entrance here. You make your way into the center of town, blending in best you can. There are a few folks who see you enter, just give you a strange look. You all are unfamiliar to the denizens of Whitestone–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh shit.","response":"DM: – but you don't look like a threat, per se. So you are noticed, and some people seem to just stop and watch you pass, but no one seems to make any active mention, note, or change in behavior towards it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are we checking buildings while we're walking through?\nLAURA: I have passive perception of 21; I'm always looking.\nLIAM: I walk over to just one random person on the street and say, anyone hiring hands? On farms?\nLAURA: Our farm burned down!\nLIAM: That is a four– No, hold on–\nLAURA: No, no, no.\nLIAM: I'm gonna use Luck, that's the Luck.\nTRAVIS: Was the first number gonna be a 40?\nLIAM: No, it's not 40. So it's 14.","response":"DM: Okay. That's two Luck rolls, by the way, that you've spent."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I know.","response":"DM: The woman you approach who's probably in her early 30s, pale blonde hair, looks like she actually might be losing it in some places, gives you a look and goes, “You poor people shouldn't be here.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We just need some work.","response":"DM: “You'll find it, but you're not going anywhere else. Welcome to Whitestone.” She turns around and walks back, joining arms with apparently a man that she's paired with, and the two of them just walk away, a bit dumbfounded that people walked into Whitestone. As this happens, you glance over your shoulder and you see coming from the northern edge from this side wall–"}
{"prompt":"(sounds of booming footsteps)\nLAURA: Oh, we should avoid that shit!","response":"DM: A very tall, noticeably undead giant with its jaw broken off and hanging from the hinge, dried, caked blood across its chest, it's just dragging this large club behind it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Where are we? What are our surroundings right now?","response":"DM: You right now, you're in a T. To the right and left are roads that go along the inside of the wall that surrounds Whitestone, to the front of you is the path that leads further into the city."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Let's go into the city!\nTRAVIS: We casually begin–\nTALIESIN: I wanna head through the city, possibly in the direction of the cemetery.","response":"DM: Cemetery's over here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, I wanna head in that direction.\nLAURA: Keeping an eye out for, you know, buildings that look clustered and abandoned that we can hide in.\nTALIESIN: What's changed?","response":"DM: What you've noticed has changed is, one: largely, the population is far more sparse than you recall. What was once a bustling city, you're now seeing about half as many people as you would see this time of day. Going through, everyone seems to be in relatively poor health. There are a few buildings that look long-term abandoned, immediately in this area here, in the outskirts, catches your guys' eye. You do notice that the corner lamps that you had set up at the different corners of the streets appear to be shattered."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Interesting.","response":"DM: There would be like, you know, glass oil lanterns that at night someone would go around and light them after the sunset. The posts that hold them now are all either broken, or the glass itself has been shattered."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: They want it to be really dark.\nTALIESIN: They want it to be really dark. I'm also thinking about that cemetery.\nSAM: We're not gonna live in a cemetery, that's super creepy.\nMARISHA: As opposed to all of the other things we've done?\nTALIESIN: Everything here is super creepy.\nLAURA: Is there any other abandoned buildings around?\nMARISHA: As opposed to sleeping in the Underdark?","response":"DM: There are plenty of buildings that look dark and mostly untouched in this section here, as you begin to move closer and closer inward."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's get east of the center square and set up camp.\nLAURA: Okay. Where's the castle? Is it on the top of the–\nTRAVIS: It's north.\nLAURA: Oh, it's that thingy? Okay.\nSAM: We're trying to shoot for here?","response":"DM: Okay. You guys move this way, as you push towards the center of this here. You–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You speak Giant, Grog?\nTRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: You move past the center here and to the left of you, you can see the town square and there it is, the Sun Tree. Very, very large, you imagine beautiful tree at one time, full height was probably about 40 feet tall. The branches twist out, and almost look like they're hanging loosely, the ends, everything looks droopy and desolate; there's not a leaf on it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do some sort of a check from a distance to see if I can recognize what kind of tree it is?","response":"DM: Make a nature check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 18.","response":"DM: Okay. It's hard to tell from this distance, there are a number of types of trees it could be. It's not indigenous to this land. The fact that it grew here means that either it was transplanted, or it was some sort of–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Magical grower.\nLAURA: (sings) Divine Intervention!","response":"DM: – magical creation for its presence."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: And you do see the silhouette of the eight figures slowly swaying from beneath the branches."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We continue on. Don't pay too much attention to it. Find a place to post up.\nMARISHA: Right. Don't get emotional.\nLAURA: If you, if you do your nature-y spell from inside a building, does it still do the same thing or do you have to be next to the tree while you're doing it?\nTRAVIS: That's a large radius, right?\nMARISHA: So the way the spell works, I can do it one of two ways. I can do it instantaneously, essentially grow up a whole bunch of plants and brush and shrubbery around me, or I can wait and I can concentrate for a while and instill a plant with vibrant–\nLAURA: Okay.\nMARISHA: – life energy and heal the farmlands and it would stretch out for a really far radius.\nLAURA: Let's keep moving.\nMARISHA: I'm gonna probably wanna do more the second one.\nLAURA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Do it from inside a house.","response":"DM: Did you guys want keep moving down this path, to go through the square, closer to the tree, do you want to go southward?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't know, it's a central point.\nLAURA: We avoid the tree a little bit and just keep going straight.","response":"DM: Okay, so you're going this way."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah?\nLIAM: There's a larger building, isn't there? I can't see–\nTALIESIN: Actually, I would say let's get a good look at the tree, let's walk by it.\nSAM: Oh, we're gonna walk by the tree?\nMARISHA: Look like it's no big deal.\nTRAVIS: I know.","response":"DM: You guys turn left, and you make your way towards the town square. And as you enter the square, looking around, you can see there are what would have been carts and small booths set up for selling of meats and other goods, what was a small, you know, barter-and-sale based hub of this town– nowhere near on the scale of Emon's bazaar, but you know, enough to support this town– desolate. All look to be closed down and untouched for quite some time. As you get a closer look to the– actually I'm gonna have you guys all roll perception checks. You're not getting too close to the tree."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Five.\nSAM: Nine.\nLIAM: 26.\nLAURA: 19. No, that's a– yeah, 19.\nMARISHA: 14.\nTALIESIN: 23.","response":"DM: As you guys are keeping on the outskirts of the square, it's hard to make out the details, and the weathering has muddled the figures that are hanging there. Percy and Vax, you guys notice the figure on the far left–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The body.","response":"DM: The body on the far left has red paint smattered across its face and its arms. It's wearing a dirtied, green, vest-like robe that dangles below it as it hangs there, loosely. Immediately to the left of it you see what looks to be the body of a child. The child is dressed up in a purplish, billowing shirt, very fine silk shirt and pantaloons, and is dangling there next to it. To the left of that you see what appears to be a female, adorned in greens and browns, looks like red paint has been driven through the hair, and dangles to the left of that figure. Next to that, you see what appears to be–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I am walking the fuck away.","response":"DM: – you see what appears to be another woman, dressed in dark blacks and browns, leathers, some furs across the top, dark hair, dangling. To the left of that you see another man dressed similarly, dark greys and blacks, long dark hair, dangling. To the left of that you see a rather large man, older, rotund, probably in his forties, clothing padded but mostly open chest, hair completely shaven bald, it looks like there are dark scars placed across the face, hanging. To the left of that you see, this figure is actually not humanoid, you see what appears to have been–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh my god.","response":"DM: – a recently hunted bear, who is dangling."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\nSAM: Wait, what? Is that us?\nMARISHA: It looks like us.\nTRAVIS: What?\nMARISHA: It's us!\nSAM: They killed people they thought were us, or they killed–\nLIAM: Or it's a message.\nSAM: Or it's a message to us.\nMARISHA: Do they look like us or were they just dressed like us? Are they made to look like us?","response":"DM: Do you want to get closer and look?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: I'm a little curious–\nTRAVIS: Do you want to get closer and look? Are you sure–\nTALIESIN: Is there anything around the tree other than us?\nTRAVIS: They're probably watching the tree.\nTALIESIN: Is there something at the base of the tree, is there anything?","response":"DM: From what you can see now, nothing but just rocks and stones and piles of loose cloth rotting below it. Approaching, it looks like each one of these bodies has been dressed up. It looks like the color in the redhead's hair has been smeared through with paint. It looks like the person who has been painted red has been slapdash. You gather with a moment of looking at it that these were not individuals that were caught this way. This was set up as a message."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispers) My god.\nSAM: Oh shit.\nLAURA: Keep walking, keep your head down and keep walking.\nMARISHA: Oh, my god.\nTRAVIS: I don't think they're here.\nMARISHA: Oh, my god.\nTRAVIS: I don't think they're here.\nSAM: You mean in town? Of course they are!\nTRAVIS: No, remember they have to, like, be where the soil they came from is?\nLAURA: No, they have, like hideouts, they don't have to be where the soil they came from is.\nTRAVIS: I don't think they're here.\nSAM: Holy shit.\nLIAM: They're in their keep, buried deep.\nTRAVIS: Okay.","response":"DM: You guys continue past, down this pathway. There's other buildings you see in the vicinity that, you know, look abandoned or for the most part unoccupied. I'd say about one in every three buildings looks like it's in disuse."}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I should know what it is, anyway.","response":"DM: – iron fence, it used to belong to one of the noble families of Whitestone. Each one of these large buildings here, these three, and you remember this, were the three families that ran the town."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We can't go anywhere near those buildings. We have to stay as far away as humanly possible.\nMARISHA: Question. You said there were eight bodies?","response":"DM: Eight bodies."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is there one that looks like a gnome cleric and one that looks like a dragonborn sorcerer?\nLAURA: That was the first one.\nMATT and TRAVIS: The one's painted all red–\nLAURA: There wasn't a gnome cleric one there.","response":"DM: No. There was a bear."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: There was no cleric when we faced them before. All of us who stood against them in Emon.\nTRAVIS: We're all there.\nSAM: Body of my guy. Is he sort of handsome?\nMARISHA: But, it does mean that it was because of when they saw us in Emon–","response":"DM: Think of an eight-year-old child."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It was a kid, yo.\nSAM: Oh, it was a child? Oh, god.\nMARISHA: – because Tiberius wasn't here with the crows.\nTRAVIS: No, it was because of Emon.\nMARISHA: It was because of Emon.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: So, can we get like a vague idea of how long these people look like they might have been here?","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (whispers) Fuck, I'm not good at this shit.\nTALIESIN: Can I help?","response":"DM: Sure. It would be advantage on that check for you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, that, you know, that wasn't bad. Woo!\nTALIESIN: Oh! Never mind.\nMARISHA: I'll take that 19, 21?","response":"DM: 21? You gather these bodies have probably been here for the better part of a week, week and a half? There is some mild decomposition starting to settle in, there is a bit of bloating to some of them. Couldn't have been much longer than that."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A week? That's before we set out.\nMARISHA: Why would they put a warning for us here in the city?\nSAM: They assumed we would come, but they don't know that we're here.\nTALIESIN: They invited us.\nLIAM: Those birds might have told them we were here.\nSAM: This was a week ago, this was before we were even close.\nTRAVIS: Let's stick with the plan.\nTALIESIN: Sticking with the plan.\nSAM: Let's go find a building.\nTALIESIN: Going to go find something that's a decent distance away from the three noble households, that has a reasonable view of the tree.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, 150 feet from the tree.","response":"DM: That would probably be somewhere in this vicinity here, as the three main houses are right there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Something with a second-floor view, but with some distance.\nTRAVIS: Preferably three bedroom, three bath.\nTALIESIN: Meh. Six.\nLAURA: Can I look out too, I've been on the lookout for a building the whole time!","response":"DM: Yeah. I'll say, I'll say it takes the better part of the next hour or so, and you do a little bit of meandering to find it, you guys are being stealthy best you can through alleys and such, but even so you are out in the open, midday, but you are also, you know, under Seeming."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Does it look like there's a covering nearby, roughly, 30 feet or so from the tree?\nLAURA: 30 feet?!\nSAM: 30 feet?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What about 150?","response":"DM: No, the tree is out in the center, and essentially the nearest building is probably anywhere from 100, 200 feet away from it. It's the tree out in the middle of the square, and the square, which used to have probably more things towards the center, more temporary establishments, have all been put to the sides and put to disuse."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Maybe underground stuff.","response":"DM: You do manage to see what appear to be what was once a tavern or an inn of some kind that is silent, closed, the doors locked and chained. The windows look dusty."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we sneak in the windows, so it keeps chained?","response":"DM: Okay. You go around the side of it, to the alley."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Dust of tracelessness.\nLAURA: Yeah, Dust of tracelessness.\nSAM: Are you guys going in?\nLIAM: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: Yeah.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: This is where we're going to hole up.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I kind of want to talk to the tree.\nLAURA: Then go talk to the tree, Keyleth.","response":"DM: The window is locked."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, not now. Not now.\nTRAVIS: No, no, no, no, no, not yet.\nSAM: Let's find a place first.\nTRAVIS: Let's post up first.\nLIAM: What am I, stealthing right now, or checking for–","response":"DM: Continuing your guys' stealth as your going, this would be your attempting to unlock the window."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, unlock, okay. So that's a 22.\nLAURA: Is there a cellar here?","response":"DM: If you guys want to look around. Are you all going in?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, we're all going in.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we're all going in.","response":"DM: You as well? Or are you talking to the tree?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes.\nTRAVIS: Come inside.\nMARISHA: Does anyone want to come talk to a tree with me?\nTALIESIN: Not yet.\nLAURA: Not yet, not just yet.\nTRAVIS: Don't bring that– don't mess with that thing.\nLIAM: Yeah, come with us. Keyleth, come with us.\nTRAVIS: Once we do it, it's like ringing a dinner bell.\nSAM: I'm gonna look for a brothel!\nTALIESIN: That's going to be the saddest brothel.\nMARISHA: The saddest brothel!","response":"DM: You find your way inside the abandoned tavern. And it is what was this giant L-shaped building, right here in the corner of the town square. There is a second floor, approximately runs 20 rooms. They are all currently unlocked, some of them left open, the bedding covered in dust, some of it looks like it was left in a hurry."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll take it.","response":"DM: There is a cellar."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: You find the cellar, and down there, there are a number of empty barrels, and a couple of ones that are still full."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ooh!","response":"DM: One that appears to be a heavy whiskey barrel, probably about twenty untouched wine bottles. A little bit of ale, but it looks like a lot of ale was either completely used, or taken with whoever left and abandoned the premises."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think we can definitely use these for explosions, if we need them.\nMARISHA: Ooh!\nSAM: Or to drink.\nTALIESIN: Muscle relaxers. Is there a view of the tree?","response":"DM: Going from a number of the rooms up top, not every room has a window, but it's like every third room on that side of the building does have a view of the entire square."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I get an eye as to how far away it is?","response":"DM: I'd say probably about 200 feet? 250 feet?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can you go invisible and still talk to the tree?\nMARISHA: Hmm?\nSAM: I can make her invisible if she can talk to the tree.\nLAURA: Can you talk to the tree if you're invisible?","response":"DM: If you cast a spell while invisible, unless it's Greater Invisibility, then it will drop the illusion."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can make her invisible.\nMARISHA: I got an idea.\nSAM: We can burrow under, we can–\nLAURA: Yeah.\nSAM: – find something closer.\nMARISHA: Actually, what are we up to right now? Are we doing anything? Are we busy?\nSAM: Well, there are windows on the first floor, right?","response":"DM: There are some windows in the tavern; there was one on the second floor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're in the cellar, that's why I went to the cellar.\nMARISHA: Oh, there's a cellar?\nSAM: I'm gonna just find some old rags, or anything I can find, tablecloths, and just cover the windows.\nLAURA: But make it not obvious, because it doesn't want to look like we covered the windows.\nSAM: True.\nLIAM: I've watched you pass through solid stone and earth. How long can you do that for?\nMARISHA: I mean, I can burrow us a tunnel right now.\nLAURA: Do it!\nLIAM: Can you get us close to underneath the tree?\nLAURA: That's what she's going to do.\nMARISHA: I'm going to do it right now. I'm going to cast Move Earth.\nLAURA: From the cellar.","response":"DM: You're going to start carving a tunnel–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: To the direction of the tree. And I want to be careful, I don't want to damage the roots of the tree at all. So, as I start getting closer, I want to start looking for the roots of the tree.","response":"DM: Okay. Easy enough to find old rags; all of them have that stale, musty towel scent to them. You get them a little wet. There's no water here; all the water here has dried out."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We use the wine.","response":"DM: You'll have to use the wine; it'll probably kill some of the bacteria. There are wells throughout the towns you see, ground wells that are set in the city. There is no nearby river. The closest river, the one you know about, is about a 30 minute walk south."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's a bit of a ways.","response":"DM: Yeah. You use that to coax them out a bit. It's easy enough for you to go around and put cloth over the windows. It's a dark interior, so it's not like an immediate–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Just so light doesn't leak out.\nLIAM: But, just in case, I think I'll hang back. I'm not going down to the pre-made tunnel, I'll just keep an eye above ground.\nTRAVIS: I am, too, I'm staying up in the tavern.\nLAURA: I'm going with you to the tunnel.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to tinker a little thing. Can I borrow an arrow?\nLAURA: Yes.\nTALIESIN: Thank you. I'm going to tinker a very little, easy thing.\nTRAVIS: You want the top floor, I'll take the bottom floor.\nTALIESIN: I want to be able to fire and ignite one of the parchments on an arrow. So that I can–\nLAURA: Do you want me to shoot the arrow for you?\nTALIESIN: – set a burn mark at a distance.","response":"DM: Interesting. Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It would be a spark, as opposed to actual flame. It would just be concussive force.","response":"DM: Right, it's more getting the parchment there without it tearing or the arrow leaving it behind, because it is a thin, flimsy piece."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It would be coiled.","response":"DM: Coiled and then–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Hit, release.","response":"DM: That's going to be a really intricate– go ahead and roll a tinkerer's check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20, 20, 20.\nTALIESIN: 16.","response":"DM: Okay. You toy with it for a while; you think you have something that may work. You're uncertain as to on its release if it'll function or not. So, write down 'Parchment Delivery Arrow' with a question mark next to it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Maybe there's a simpler way.\nTALIESIN: There might be, but just in case there's not, I want to make sure this works.\nMARISHA: You could always slap it up there  and shoot it with a flame arrow.\nTALIESIN: I've got three of them, so I've got options. But I just want to make sure–\nMARISHA: How's my burrowing going? 200 feet.\nLAURA: Can you talk to it from here, Keyleth?","response":"DM: The roots that you see, they continue past the tunnel. They go very, very deep into the ground."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Awesome. I'm going to clear out a little more area, and I'm going to touch the roots and cast Speak with Plants.\nTRAVIS: Holy shit.\nSAM: Speak with Plants?\nLIAM: Haroom haroom.\nTALIESIN: The only superpower more pathetic than Aquaman's.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Shut up.\nTALIESIN: Sorry, had to.\nLAURA: (kid's voice) Gee wiz, I wish I had some water.\nMARISHA: (kid's voice) The sun is so bright today!\nLAURA: Too bad we don't have Tiberius with us with his endless water fucking pitcher.\nLIAM: It's Ent voice. Haroom haroom!\nTALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.\nLAURA: Sure, sure, sure.\nTALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.\nSAM: I can go to one of the wells and get some water.\nTALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.\nMARISHA: Hey, he's cool sometimes.\nTALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.\nMARISHA: Sometimes.\nTALIESIN: It's what fish say. Hi, Aquaman.\nMARISHA: That's what fish say.\nLIAM: That's all they say.\nTALIESIN: Hi, Aquaman.","response":"DM: You finish the spell and you reach out and you touch the root and you instill the force of your nature-based divine energies into the root. Silence."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh no.","response":"DM: This tree is dead."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No!\nSAM: Dead?!\nLAURA: You can bring it back!\nMARISHA: I can bring it back. Should I?\nSAM: You can do that?\nMARISHA: I'm a druid, that's my– yeah man!\nSAM: You can bring dead things back?\nMARISHA: Yeah, it's called Plant Growth!\nSAM: What?!\nMARISHA: Yeah!\nSAM: This I gotta see.\nMARISHA: Should I? Okay. But it's dead. What time is it now?","response":"DM: Right now, with all the traveling you guys have done, I'd say it's past noon, probably. Including the time you've spent inside the tavern, searching it through and preparing it as your base of operations."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Try it.\nMARISHA: Should I start it up now?\nSAM: Yeah!\nLIAM, LAURA, and TRAVIS: Go for it!\nMARISHA: I'm going to start my Plant Growth. I'm going to drop. Can I try to clear out an area where I can– I should be fine.\nLAURA: Reach up in its junk.\nTALIESIN: Put your hand in it.\nMARISHA: I'm going to strap on my gloves.\nTRAVIS: Okay.\nLIAM: Turn and cough.\nMARISHA: Hope you guys are ready for this.\nSAM: Is it going to be loud?\nMARISHA: No, it's just going to take a long time.\nTRAVIS: Vax and I are guarding the tavern, so if anything comes–\nSAM: I'm going to get provisions ready to spoon-feed her.\nMARISHA: Actually, before I do that, can we all have one last meal together and eat a Heroes' Feast?\nLAURA: I like it.\nTALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: Certainly."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's eat.","response":"DM: So, you've made the purchase within Emon for how many of the requisite chalice for the Heroes' Feast?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How many did I buy?\nTALIESIN: You have at least one.\nMARISHA: It gets used. It's expensive.\nLAURA: It's $1,000.\nMARISHA: It's $1,000.","response":"DM: It's a gem-encrusted bowl worth 1,000 gold pieces, which the spell consumes. So, we'll say how many of those did you purchase in Emon, knowing you'd be casting this in the future?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How much gold do we have?\nSAM: Not a lot.\nLAURA: Is that for each person, or 1,000 gold for the whole party?","response":"DM: For the whole feast."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How about you did three bowls?\nMARISHA: Three bowls.","response":"DM: Mark 3,000 gold from the group's queue. And you have three gem bowls, using one now. So you have two bowls left at your disposal. And you prepare a Heroes' Feast for the group to consume."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I take some of that leftover wine, use that to make it fancy wine.\nSAM: This is great. This is awesome.\nLAURA: Are we eating in the cellar?\nMARISHA: So you get, I believe, 2d12 additional hit points on top of your maximum hit points.\nSAM: Wait, forever?\nLAURA: No, no, for how long?\nMARISHA: For 24 hours.","response":"DM: It lasts for 24 hours."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 2d12?","response":"DM: So, until about–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What the fuck is a d12? I've never rolled a d12.","response":"DM: – 2PM tomorrow. So mark that down, somebody note that it lasts until 2PM."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: An additional 2d12?","response":"DM: 2d10?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry, 2d10.\nTALIESIN: Damn it.\nLAURA: Overall hit points.\nMARISHA: And, you should have- Ooh! I got two tens!\nLAURA: Ah, badass!","response":"DM: Trinket can also benefit from this, by the way, too."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yay! Nice.\nTALIESIN: You also get other bonuses.","response":"DM: Yep. You are immune to poison, and diseases, and being frightened, and all wisdom saving throws are made with advantage. Feast is awesome."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Why don't we do that right before we go see the Briarwoods, also?\nLAURA: We have another bowl.\nMARISHA: We have two more bowls.\nSAM: Because that is fucking awesome.\nMARISHA: Doing that right now, just in case the Briarwoods decide to come say hello.\nTALIESIN: Or any of the other terrible people who live in this town because there are terrible people in this town.\nTRAVIS: That was a delicious feast.\nSAM: The tikka masala was tangy!\nMARISHA: So, we're immune to poison–","response":"DM: And disease and frightened. So, feast consumed, you now take your next eight hours–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to go meditate. I'll be back in eight hours.","response":"DM: –to work on this. As she sits down to begin the ritual of cleansing, or bringing plant vitality enhancement to the vicinity of Whitestone. We're going to go ahead and end today's session there.

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I love you all so much. I love you so much.","response":"DM: This is getting real interesting."}

{"prompt":"LIAM: Was it around eight in the morning when we got to that house?","response":"DM: You guys got to town around nine, 9:30."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So the spell probably started around 11.","response":"DM: Walking around, seeing things, finding the  tavern. And then getting in there and cleaning it out. I'd say you're getting close to one, two o'clock now.  You've also taken it slow, you're also being stealthy and not trying to be conspicuous as you move  through."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right, so we'll start the fight in the morning the next day.\nMARISHA: Well, I'm meditating now. I dropped into  my meditation–\nSAM: We're not starting any fight, we're forming an insurgency.\nMARISHA: Hopefully nothing happens and y'all don't have to defend me while I'm doing this shit. That's what I'm hoping for.\nTALIESIN: I have stuff to give you, too, 'cause, yeah.\nSAM: Wow.\nLAURA: Man.\nTALIESIN: Thank you for letting me roll with that, by the way.","response":"DM: Of course. It fit right into my–"}

{"prompt":"(thump from Sam's mug)","response":"DM: Well played. So. To give us a little overview of the current story. Two nasty individuals known as the  Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, have, for the past five years, been occupying the city of Whitestone, which was once the home to Percival here, after it was forcefully taken from his family, most of which seemingly have been either killed or lost in the process, and he was scattered to the four winds to find Vox Machina. After encountering the Briarwoods in Emon in a scuffle that took place, the Briarwoods retreated to Whitestone, inviting the party to come and say hello. Since then, the party has prepared the best they could, made their way towards Whitestone, and, through some bit of infiltration and subterfuge, managed to sneak into the city itself. They, under the guise of Scanlan's Seeming illusion, appeared to be as common folk as the rest of the poor saps that still live in Whitestone. They scoped out an abandoned tavern, which they fitted to their needs as a base of operations, and also managed to come across a central portion of Whitestone's city structure and history, known as the Sun Tree, a tree once risen to the might of the god of the sun, Pelor, now lies dead in the center of town, and from it hung eight figures that appear to have been individuals killed, hung, and painted up and dressed to resemble Vox Machina as essentially a warning, or a welcome. It's hard to tell when it comes to the Briarwoods. Nevertheless, a message was definitely delivered. The party, retreating back to the tavern, set up for the remainder of the afternoon. Keyleth carved, through her druidic magical ways, through the ground to find some of the roots of the Sun Tree, and began preparing an extensive, time-consuming ritual in hopes of restoring some semblance of life to the entity itself. That is where we left off. While the rest of you have been going about your preparations for the rest of the afternoon as this ritual for Keyleth is an eight-hour ritual and it begun in the early afternoon around 2:00, so this will conclude by around sundown, a little past sundown. While she is down there, essentially meditating with the barren roots of the Sun Tree, is there anything you guys would wish to do, or are you just waiting for her to complete her ritual?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well, there are options.\nSAM: What do we need? We have to get water, right? There was some issue about– we don't have any water, do we?\nTALIESIN: Was that an issue?\nSAM: I don't remember. There was some wells around.\nMARISHA: Can I do a few checks while I'm preparing the ritual to see if this is a curse over this tree?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a religion check, I guess."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Not great. Hang on, my ring of protection is in the way. Nine.","response":"DM: Nine. Honestly, it's hard to tell if it's a curse, the tree itself is just dead. You are very well-connected with the natural essences of the world, the life essence of plants and natural growth. All of your interactions with the Sun Tree are devoid of any response. It seems dead where it stands. But, as you continue your ritual–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: God, I hope this works.","response":"DM: Anyone else have anything they want to do?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, couple of things. Grog and I were keeping watch. I forget, one of us was on the first floor and one's on the second. I'm just going to say that I was on the second for now. Because I can't remember. It's probably wrong. I'm going to take all daggers out of my Blinkback Belt except for the Keen Dagger and replace them with wooden stakes that I purchased. And I'm going to spend an hour or so, whatever it takes to– I've got partial gloves on; I'm going to take that symbol of Sarenrae and I'm going to take as much time as it needs to sew it so that it is fixed firmly to the back of my right hand. I tell Grog that I'm going to go down below and check, and I follow the path all the way down to find– I think everyone else is down there.\nSAM: Oh hi, Vax.\nLIAM: I step over Scanlan's head and I kneel down by Keyleth and gently place a hand on her shoulder and say: What do you need? What can I get?\nMARISHA: I don't really know. I don't know if this is going to work, to be totally honest. The tree is dead. Do you have any of that holy water?\nLIAM: I got holy oil. Not water.\nMARISHA: Do I have holy water? I don't know if I took one or not. I can't remember.","response":"DM: If you didn't write it down, it's not in your inventory."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm pretty good about that. I don't think I took one.\nTALIESIN: In the meantime, there are options.\nLIAM: I got two. I remember it. It was two vials of holy oil. I gave one to my sister, and I have the other. If you think it will help, you take it.\nMARISHA: Okay.\nLIAM: Do you need me to get water?\nMARISHA: Yeah, let's get some water.","response":"DM: Yeah, because as you guys went through the tavern, you found there was no actual water. There was old ale. There were still a few casks of wine. Stuff that was abandoned when whoever previously was the owner of this tavern either left Whitestone or fell to a worse fate. But there was no plain water to drink."}

You aren't at the bottom of the roots. You've met the roots as you were carving through. They go even deeper than where you are right now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah. Can I start carving a little ravine around it for where we're going to start pouring the water?","response":"DM: If you've already started the eight-hour process of the secondary spell, you would not be able to really interrupt that to be able to continue another spell you've been doing. I could say that you did that as part of your preparation for the roots. That's fine. That's fine. It'd be a small ravine, because you also don't want to–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Damage anything.","response":"DM: You continue your ritual. The rest of you make your way out the same window that you entered, into the alleyway, following Percival. You lead them to the back of the tavern into one of the large alleyways between this chunk of the city. You find there was a grassy area; most of the grass here has turned gray and brittle, as it is starting to push towards the winter months. And even for the daytime, the temperature is pretty chilly. It's probably around 50 or so degrees, 55. Fahrenheit, for our un-American friends. Eventually, you make your way to the nearest well that you've been to. And there is a bucket there. It looks like it has gathered some dust and some cobwebs. You get the bucket, and you let it down, and eventually it finds its way into the water. It's pretty deep before it hit the water. You don't know if it's been just, like, water level, or if this particular well itself is drying up. But you manage to get a bucket up, and you pull it up and check it and it looks clear. You take the water back with you to the tavern. Seemingly uneventful. You guys have managed to stay far enough out of sight. Nothing seems to caught your attention."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Should we scout around and see if there's anything else around the hideout that we should be aware of, or any other hiding places, or safehouses?\nLIAM: I feel like we should probably bring a little more water than one bucket. So we should spend a little bit of time doing that. But maybe my sister and I can have a look around, see if there's anything that we've missed. Outside.\nTALIESIN: Well, here's the question. There's three lordly houses that we have to avoid at all costs, for now. There's a few shops that if we feel might be in our best interest to scout out. I know where an old weapons depot used to be. We could check the temples to maybe see if we could maybe find some support to begin with.\nLIAM: Do we trust anyone here?\nSAM: We need friends.\nTALIESIN: There might be people I trust.\nSAM: Is there a central meeting place?\nTALIESIN: There's a temple.\nSAM: Is that a place where you can really chat up brand new people? Or is there a pub? I guess it's not really a pub town, is it?\nTALIESIN: It's not a pub town. And it's a place where you don't necessarily chat up new people, but maybe find some old ones.\nSAM: Okay. We could go there.\nLIAM: Percival, we're on your turf, so I'll follow your lead.\nTALIESIN: (sighs) If we have just enough time, I'd like to try to go to the temple and the cemetery. Leave, maybe Grog and Vex to guard Keyleth.","response":"DM: Okay. So, Keyleth, you're staying behind to finish the ritual?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm doing what I do best. And I focus all my energy on this thing.","response":"DM: There are two temples in here. There's the temple to Pelor, which is known as the Zenith. Within the graveyard."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes, the Zenith is the one I wanted to go to.\nSAM: What's the other one?\nTALIESIN: The other one is called The Lady's Chamber. It's a temple of Erathis.\nSAM: That sounds fun.\nTALIESIN: I don't know anybody there.\nSAM: I might!\nTALIESIN: That's what I'm afraid– they might know you, so no.","response":"DM: So the Lady's Chamber, the temple to Erathis, is more central to the city and is partially a courtyard, partially a half-dome amphitheater place of worship. You guys make your way through the city. I'll have you all roll stealth checks if you could."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We're not trying to hide, are we?","response":"DM: Well, if you're not trying to hide, then make deception checks instead."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Awesome possum.\nSAM: I rolled an 18 for something.\nLIAM: Can I choose to hide instead of deceive?","response":"DM: If you'd like to."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I'll hang a little bit back from them.\nTALIESIN: I was trying to be stealthy, as well.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Although I'm fine either way. 23.\nSAM: I'm better deceiving.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 26.","response":"DM: So we have two folks staying to the shadows, best they can in broad daylight in a clustered city. And one child-looking pauper of a boy wandering through the city alone towards the graveyard. As you guys make your way through, staying off to the side, jumping, or running through buildings and staying off the main path, you walk along the central road to the far eastern side of Whitestone. A few folks come out during the day, some are carrying bundles of textile goods. There's one guy that has a small cart, and it looks like he's bringing tools and stuff either to or from a store of some kind. Gives you a curious look as if he hasn't seen you before but doesn't seem to–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: G'day, sir!","response":"DM: “G'day!” And just keeps rolling along, the wheels squeaking as he pushes up the road."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I wish I had a yo-yo.\nTALIESIN: How about a wheel and stick?\nSAM: Oh, the wheel and stick would be good.","response":"DM: Eventually, you guys make your way to the far eastern side of Whitestone. This is where the boundary wall that surrounds most of the city from a defensive standpoint lies. There is the multiple exit points throughout this wall. You dart around the outskirts of it, being careful to avoid the pattern of the undead giants that are slowly stomping through the city, like these hulking sentinels that walk in a perpetual pattern through the town. You follow the winding path through the thick woods, just on the outside of the wall of the city itself. You sticking to the path in your open way, or do you want to join them in the side of the forest?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wait a minute, nope. Let me look. I'm just going to move in, ten feet ahead, and see what I see.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is a 23 for perception.","response":"DM: Okay. You skirt up and look inside. And there's a handful of trees in little clusters here and there, but for the most part this old graveyard is flat land, with just stones set up throughout. The older stones have very little rhyme or reason to their placement. They're sporadically thrown around, fresher ones tend to be more clustered with family names. This definitely looks like something that was put here when the town was founded and has been slowly expanded over time, and it's not uniform."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I hiss back at Percy: is this the way to your temple?\nTALIESIN: (whispers) Yes.\nLIAM: Through here?\nTALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: You do see, a little ways ahead in the center of this open barren area, there is a stone temple that has, from what little you can see, a bit of stained glass pattern to it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do we knock?\nSAM: Is it safe? Should we go up?\nTALIESIN: We go up to the doors, and give it a tug.","response":"DM: Okay. Percy walks up to the doors."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This is my neighborhood. I feel comfortable.","response":"DM: Okay. You–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I look–\nSAM: This is what he does!\nLIAM: It is what I do. This is an old, old type of lock, hold on.","response":"DM: There is no lock, actually."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: There's no lock? Oh, but I rolled a natural 20. Does that help? Let me get through the door?\nTALIESIN: Suddenly, a lock appears! Utterly pickable!\nMARISHA: Utterly pickable! It's the most pickable lock I've ever seen!","response":"DM: There is no lock. It is barred from the other side. There is some heavy wooden plank that is currently set on the other side of the door."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, where's Grog when you need him?","response":"DM: So, with your expertise in these sort of circumstances, you know that with the proper placement of a long blade and enough strength and weight put at the right fulcrum point, you can probably shimmy it off, and it may take a little bit of teamwork to do so."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay who's got a– mine are all very small. Do you have a shortsword?\nSAM: Everything I have is short. I can just go in there and open it from the inside.\nLIAM: Oh, right. I always forget.\nSAM: It's not concentration, so I can just jump in there.","response":"DM: Essentially."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Don't fuse with a church pew.","response":"DM: If you're referring to a Dimension Door–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Correct. It's not concentration, I don't think.","response":"DM: No, it is not concentration."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: More of a sneeze.","response":"DM: You can visualize it. It doesn't have to be a place you have seen yet."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can say I want to go ten feet in that direction.","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Before I do, why are we trying to get in here? I thought it was to meet people. I don't think there's anyone in there.\nTALIESIN: I would like to find out what happened.\nSAM: Okay, good enough for me. I go in.","response":"DM: Okay. (spoof) With a burst of dark purplish energy, Scanlan steps through the door, leaving no mark or trace behind. On the other side you hear this muffled (spoof) as he reappears on the opposite side, completing his transition. You appear now in the central worship hall of the Zenith temple. To each side of you, you can see there are windows, about ten foot wide, stained glass windows, about every ten feet around this pattern, it looks like three to each side. There are pews set up for the masses to come and sit and worship, but a lot of the pews have been pushed off to the side, set astray, some have been destroyed and ruined.  There's a pile in the corner of a number of sundered and tattered pews. There is a red carpet that marks the center that goes all the way to what looks like a raised altar on the opposite side of the room. You can see that some of the stained glass further down has been shattered and broken, and a little bit of sunlight creeps through. You can see there is on the altar a large stone platform. It's hard to see from this distance. Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (muffled) Scanlan! Open the door.\nSAM: We do have earrings. 17.","response":"DM: There appears to be something on the altar in the distance, small and scattered about it, but from this distance, it's hard to make out the details. But you hear Vax muffled through the door."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A couple hundred pounds?","response":"DM: I would say it probably weighs about 40 or 50 pounds."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 40 or 50 pounds?!","response":"DM: It's wood. It's porous."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And how high off the ground? Could I touch it?","response":"DM: You could touch it. It gets to about your head, a little higher."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Athletics? Hmm. Not good. 12!","response":"DM: (grunting) From this position, it's not even budging."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's not going to do much. There's a big heavy thing.\nLIAM: I'm going to hold on one side, you're going to hold on the other, and we'll do it together. Percy, can I borrow your blade?","response":"DM: What is it?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's a boarding sword, it was one of those little curved swords.","response":"DM: Right. A scimitar or falchion."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A scimitar. But short. It was nothing, it was terrible.\nLIAM: It's all we need.\nTALIESIN: Yeah so. Get it in there.\nLIAM: Scanlan, grab some rags or something, wrap it around the blade. You're going to lift on your side; we're going to lift on this side.\nSAM: I get the sharp side?!\nLIAM: I can't get the handle through the crack in the door.\nLIAM: Got that Bigby's Hand, is that what you're saying?\nSAM: Yeah, I've got a million things I could do.\nTALIESIN: Are any of them concentration spells?\nSAM: Bigby's is probably concentration, but I've also got a potion of strength.","response":"DM: As a note, Seeming isn't concentration."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I thought it was.","response":"DM: No. You cast it and it lasts for eight hours. You don't need to worry about that."}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, I want to follow this through.\nTALIESIN: Let's keep going.\nTALIESIN: One, two, three.","response":"DM: Add your strength modifier."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 16!\nSAM: Plus strength. 12.\nSAM: Wait, did you get a four? Four? We are the worst! We are the weakest ones. Oh, I cut my hand!","response":"DM: Which is exactly what happens."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN and LIAM: Bigby's Hand? Bigby's Hand!\nSAM: I'm going to take damage.","response":"DM: Yeah. First and foremost, you take four points of slashing damage to your hand. You pull back, and there is a line of blood now, beginning to drip off your hand. You shake it amongst yourself."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I can't say “God damn it” in here. I'm in Pelor's– Sorry, Pelor.\nTALIESIN: Let's use a sword, I want to see how this plays out.\nLIAM: Whip out the purple hand, man!\nSAM: Seems like overkill. What about a Thunderwave? Can I do that?","response":"DM: Certainly."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wait. Scanlan, are there any windows in there?\nSAM: There are. There are windows. Good call.","response":"DM: It's a blast of thunderous energy in an area, it would affect living and nonliving matter, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hold on, this is stupid.\nSAM: Are you sure?\nTALIESIN: We are going to the window. We are going to the window.\nSAM: No, let's carry this out.\nTALIESIN: No! We are going to the window. Please do not destroy the temple of Pelor.\nSAM: Three hours later, we are still trying to open the door.\nMARISHA: It's not even locked. It's just heavy.\nSAM: I can Bigby's Hand. I'll just Bigby's Hand.\nLIAM: Which way to the window? I can walk to the window.\nSAM: It's up there. You can make it, but Percy can't.\nLIAM: I can probably lift that door bar from inside.\nSAM: You could, probably.\nLIAM: With your help, son.\nSAM: Yeah, but I could blast it. Would be very dramatic.\nSAM: To the right and up.","response":"DM: There are windows shattered on both sides. They're broken a little higher up. So you could either continue to break the bottom part of the window, or just attempt to leap through the hole."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I'll attempt to leap.","response":"DM: Okay, so give me an acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: The saga of the door!\nMARISHA: It's just a door, you guys! It's just a door.\nLIAM: 25.","response":"DM: 25. You get a running start, leap off the side and parkour up between the actual– there is an extension to the side where another room is attached on each side of the temple towards the back. You leap off that wall onto the small pillar that's holding the side of the window and up through the broken portion of the stained glass, landing, three-point landing, on the inside. You almost land in one of the shattered piles of wooden pews and splinters and jagged pieces of wood sticking out of it. About a foot away from you, and you are like, “Oh, that was close.” You see Scanlan across the way. You see the altar to your right."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hey! Oi! Your stupid idea cut my hand!\nLIAM: Builds character. I'm going to stay away from the altar and skirt the wall all the way around it.\nMat: Okay, you get to the door.\nLIAM: I'm going to try to help. Do you want to help me lift this thing?\nSAM: With my good hand, yes.","response":"DM: Have both you guys make strength checks."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You know what, I'm going to get some assistance. I call my Unseen Servant to assist.\nSAM: He is going to lift with us.","response":"DM: With a brief burst of wind energy, a shimmering form, somewhat humanoid in shape, but still amorphous appears."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hi, Darrell.","response":"DM: (wind sounds) and begins to shove itself up against the bottom of the wooden bar. Make your check, as well."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That was a six. Is that for me?","response":"DM: That's for you, and then roll and add five for your Unseen Servant."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So, five extra to that is 11. Right? No?","response":"DM: Roll again, add five."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I see. Four. So that's a nine.\nMARISHA: Man, Laura and Travis ain't missing shit!\nLIAM: Whip out the hand!","response":"DM: This giant, glimmering, purple fist appears in your vicinity. It grabs the bottom. Go ahead and roll a d20."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on.\nSAM: 12.","response":"DM: Plus eight to it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Plus eight? 20!\nTALIESIN: How do you want to do this?","response":"DM: With its finger, just goes (ping) and it (thudding noises). The door (creak) opens up and Percy stands there, looking not very happy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Was it overkill? Because really it took that.\nSAM: It took three spells to open this door! Three spells!\nTALIESIN: It's not overkill if you used what it took.\nSAM: Three spells and I injured myself.\nTALIESIN: We took damage from an inanimate object. Oh god! Get it out of our system now!\nSAM: Welcome, Percy.","response":"DM: Looking about the place, it looks pseudo-ransacked. There has been much force used in whatever destroyed these pews. The glass that was broken, was broken from the outside in. So, definitely seems like there was someone throwing a rock through, or a intrusion from an outside standpoint. As you walk further and look around, the two rooms to the side, the doors are closed. There is the altar on the top, and you do see, there is a couple of small sacks, laid to the side of the altar. What looks to be some low-lit candles, and there are some braziers. One to each side of the altar, and one against each wall. All of them appear to be long dark and out. Go ahead and make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: All of us?","response":"DM: All of you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 15.\nTALIESIN: 15.","response":"DM: You both, as you approach the far side of the temple towards the altar, you notice the brazier to the right is smoldering ever so gently. Just a very faint glow of ember to it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What's the matter?\nTALIESIN: Reynal?\nSAM: Who? Reynal?\nTALIESIN: Father Reynal? (louder) Father Reynal? Let's check one of the doors. We'll start on the door on the right.","response":"DM: You step up. You can see now, on top of the altar, there appears to be a couple of glass vials that are overturned, a little liquid spilled. You can see bits of broken glass across the bottom, the one step that leads down from the altar's raised platform."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Can I dip and smell?","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 13.","response":"DM: 13? Okay. Looking at just the general vicinity of the altar. You taste the liquid. It's definitely somewhat caustic in nature, you can't really determine it. But, just touching it to your tongue, your tongue goes numb for a second and you feel a slight burn. Your nostrils clear out a little bit from the scent. There is some random powders and such that've been brushed off. You get the feeling that the way that all this was treated, it wasn't so much like it was destroyed more than it was hastily packed up. Roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 20.","response":"DM: 20? Okay, looking about the outside of the altar, you do notice that around the brazier that is slightly smoldering there is a layer of ash there, gathered on the inside of the brazier and a little bit on the floor, around its base."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.\nTALIESIN: Someone has been working on something in here.\nSAM: It couldn't just be ash from the thing that is burning?","response":"DM: If you look at the other braziers, there is no ash around it. Most of the ash is contained. The wood ash itself tends to fall; it's a little heavier. This seems to be a lighter shade of ash and it's more of a– has found its way out of the brazier from just the heat and the air."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I want to smell the ash. Does it smell like some sort of– is it perfumed?","response":"DM: You lean down and you take some of the ash in your fingers and smell it. It's not perfumed, but you've had some experience with dealing with various burning materials: this is definitely paper-based ash. You do also notice underneath the brazier there is one sliver of paper that was not wholly burned."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Paper.\nMARISHA: (whispering) Paper.\nSAM: It's a golden ticket.\nTALIESIN: “Without sufficient magical essence the distillation is proven to consistently fail. A shame, really. I shall seek an influx of materials elsewhere before I can continue this project. Regarding the weapon, after a year of taking notes from eyewitness accounts, my original designs were faulty and recently cost me my hand. The wind of fortune has seen a shift it seems as Sylas just returned from Emon, having encountered the still-living subject, and had the pleasure of seeing his work first-hand. His unnatural eyes took in much detail. I believe his observations have brought me to the brink of finishing my design. I intend to journey from Whitestone within a couple of months to gather the components needed. But, if Delilah's hunch is correct, the subject is heading here. I may find myself needing to leave sooner than anticipated.”\nLIAM: They're trying to copy your work.\nSAM: Copy?\nTALIESIN: Why?\nLIAM: For war.\nTALIESIN: I want to take another look at everything that was on the altar, and I want to see if it looks–","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 18.","response":"DM: Testing what's there: I mean, a lot of the material has been scattered and mixed but there are elements that resemble the black powder you've used in some of your constructs and tinkering in the past."}
{"prompt":"SAM: They're making guns!\nTALIESIN: Well, we know we're looking for someone without a hand.\nSAM: To do what?\nTALIESIN: To find out who's trying to copy my work.\nSAM: Someone who is working with Sylas, right?\nTALIESIN: Yes. Let's check the rest of the temple.\nLIAM: Yes.\nSAM: Okay, I'm going to go up on the altar. Was there a small something on the altar?","response":"DM: What you noticed were like some of the glass vials that were overturned."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What's in the pouches?","response":"DM: Looking at the pouches, it looks like some of them contained phosphorus, some of them contained other alchemical reagents that were used in the research but most have been emptied, and it's just a residuum on the inside."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Checking the door on the right.","response":"DM: Door on the right."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Going with.","response":"DM: (creak) Opens up into what was Father Reynal's room. As the door opens, you're immediately hit with terrible smell of decay. And you can see, shoved under the bed that first appears on the opposite side of the small room, what appears to be the remains of Father Reynal. Long passed and left to fester beneath his bed."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I tell how he died?","response":"DM: You're welcome to go ahead and take a look. Roll an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 23.","response":"DM: 23. Looking at the body, it appears that there are a series of puncture wounds. Rapier-based. They're too long, like stiletto, too long to be a dagger."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Not teeth.","response":"DM: No, they are inflicted by a weapon, a long thin weapon. And multiple to the torso."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to search the room for anything else. Search the body.","response":"DM: Okay. Searching the body, searching the room, it looks like everything of interest has been taken from the place. You find some leftover stale food, you find some candles that are generally used for the purposes of worship here in the temple, but anything beyond that– all the drawers have been emptied, everything has been taken by whoever was previously setting up residence in this facility."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are there any holy symbols or anything that we might take to give to Keyleth to, I don't know. Wasn't she gonna– I don't know. Do some holy shit?","response":"DM: You do notice that, throughout the temple, there are images of Pelor, flame-wreathed face, various sun and stars that are set up, but most of them have been profaned, marked on, shattered, or covered in soot. An intentional effort has been made to dampen the power of Pelor in this once-holy place."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Are there any untouched?","response":"DM: None that are untouched, but there are some that could possibly be cleaned. A couple of small medallions that are hanging up in the room where the Father lays."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll snag those.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I want to check the other room. The room to the left.","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So much perception. 19.\nSAM: 19.\nLIAM: 20.\nMARISHA: Finish. First.\nSAM: What's that?","response":"DM: No wind is moving. There is a stillness to the air."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Stepping back into the darkest shadows I can see.","response":"DM: As you guys take in this sense, this sound gets louder and louder. At which point, the air itself gets colder and colder. As you nervously exhale, you can see your breath becoming visible in the air around you. As you all look at each other, you, stepping back into what shadows there are, as it is a very open temple, as it's a temple of sun–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 32 stealth.","response":"DM: You find what tiny little alcove you can of shadow. It's not going to offer a lot of protection once you move, but for now you seem to be out of the circumstance."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I grab Percy, and I make us both go invisible.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So, what is that, a 3rd-level Invisibility spell?","response":"DM: Yeah. You guys both vanish, holding your place on top of the altar, and as that moaning tends to grow louder and louder you can see this shimmer at the doors that are open on the opposite side of the room. It looks like a woman. A form of a woman, but translucent in nature, drifting in, giving off the horrible (raspy groan) sound, as it drifts in and you see it looking around and the features are gaunt as it gets closer. It looks elven by racial nature, but the eyes are just these sunken faintly glowing sockets, the hair wild and matted and floating behind it, its hands reaching out, and as it gets partway through the temple, it looks like it's seeking something, and its eyes fall directly on you two."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm throwing a dagger right now.","response":"DM: Let's go ahead and–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ugh! What if she was a good guy?\nLIAM: It's a banshee, man.\nSAM: What if it's a good banshee? Some of the banshees that I've met have been decent. We're rolling for initiative?\nSAM: I'm glad I used half my spells trying to get into this goddamn place.","response":"DM: Off to the side there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He means well.\nTALIESIN: He means well. That's a terrible costume.","response":"DM: You guys are on the altar there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You were so prepared for me to go to the temple that you built it?","response":"DM: I built the whole city, because I didn't know where you guys were going to go."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Jesus, Matt!\nMARISHA: He does have a pile of maps over there.","response":"DM: Shh! Don't look at it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm not looking, I'm not looking.\nMARISHA: I'm just noting the pile.","response":"DM: So, first and foremost, let's go ahead and roll initiative."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: You'll get a surprise round."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.\nMARISHA: Dope.\nLIAM: Natural 20 for initiative, as well.\nMARISHA: You finally got a good initiative roll!\nSAM: I got a seven.\nTALIESIN: I got an 11! Together, we can get a Slurpee. I'm weird tonight. I don't know what's up.\nSAM: Well, I can't do anything.\nMARISHA: You have advantage!\nTALIESIN: I rolled a one and then a natural 20.\nLIAM: 17.","response":"DM: 17?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Thank you for the advantage.\nMARISHA: You're welcome.","response":"DM: Scanlan?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 11.","response":"DM: With advantage?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I also always have advantage, so do I get to roll a third time?\nLIAM: No. Doesn't stack.","response":"DM: Unfortunately you are considered frightened by this entity. It scares the crap out of you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA and TALIESIN: You can't be frightened after a Heroes' Feast.","response":"DM: Ah! Then never mind. You feel it shake your form for a second. Its horrible visual presence, for a second, freaks you out, but then you remember the knowledge that your friends are here and you have to serve a purpose and you shake off–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Not only do I shake it off, I gird my loins!\nMARISHA: Just for a refresher: you're immune to poison, disease, and fear, and you have advantage on your wisdom throws.\nTALIESIN: We should do this every time we fly.\nMARISHA: It's expensive.\nLIAM: So, do I get to attack and then move into the combat round where I got a natural 20 plus five for initiative?","response":"DM: Well, you go first. Technically, it's not a surprise round because the creature can sense life and saw them before it happens, so it wasn't ambushed. But you do get to go first, and you do get to go before it. In the use of surprise, I didn't mean to use it in the surprise round fashion. These entities can detect living creatures up to five miles away."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So, there's no sneak attack damage on this thing, is there?","response":"DM: If you get to it first, you still have advantage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 15, so this is a 26 to hit.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. And this gets the sneak attack damage?","response":"DM: This would, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm just going to keen dagger it three times in a row. Oh, I've got to roll to attack, so that is a twelve plus– 22?","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. Two, and that is six of damage, and then natural 20 on that one. That is three, four, three, plus seven is ten, so 20 for that, if it's doubled for a critical hit.","response":"DM: For double dice, not doubled modifier."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You know what, just to be fair, I changed out all my daggers except for one, so I probably couldn't throw the same dagger three times in a row, so I think should pull back some of the modifiers, so I would pull out four, because my dagger is plus two. So the plus two for two of those hits gets taken out, right?","response":"DM: It would actually, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So four, minus four.","response":"DM: So, minus four damage to this other guy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So truthful.\nSAM: So, we're fighting it with wooden stakes?","response":"DM: Wait so you threw wooden stakes at it as two of the attacks?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I threw one dagger and two wooden stakes.","response":"DM: Okay. So, the first dagger hits?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: First was the dagger, yeah.","response":"DM: Yeah. The two other stakes pass through its form without any other impact. The one dagger does return to you, but the two stakes just clatter in the distance, and the creature seems unharmed by those two."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Even though they came out of the belt?","response":"DM: Yeah!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's okay. It's just wood.\nTALIESIN: You learned.","response":"DM: So that ends that point. The creature now swoops up to the center of you three and gives out this horrible (roar) this wailing scream that bursts out in the air, you feel like the wind push you back and all of you feel like for a moment you're staring at your own death. I need all three of you guys to roll  constitution saving throws."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Does our meal help us with that at all?","response":"DM: Nope."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 11.\nMARISHA: Wait, don't forget you have the additional–\nLIAM: What?\nMARISHA: 2d10 hit points on top.\nSAM: Okay. 16.\nLIAM: 16.","response":"DM: Okay. Both of you guys, you feel this chilling burst of spiritual energy blast through your soul. And you each take 14 points of psychic damage. Percy, however, as you look at it, it seems like this blast actually forces the soul from your body momentarily. You immediately drop to zero hit points and are unconscious."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What? No! No, he can't. Oh, god.","response":"DM: So with that, you see Percy, eyes roll back and then collapse onto the floor like a pile of cold bones. Out. Percy, it's your turn. Go ahead and make a death saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 11.","response":"DM: 11, okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's a good sign.","response":"DM: Scanlan, it's your turn."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Very quickly. Should we flee?\nMARISHA: Get the fuck out.\nLIAM: In a little bit.\nSAM: In a little bit? Okay.\nLIAM: Without Percy?\nMARISHA: Well, get him up.","response":"DM: You still have Bigby's Hand, by the way, on concentration."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, that's right!","response":"DM: Let's see how long that lasts, actually. Let me see how long it lasts. Just to be safe."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We haven't been there very long. (whispering) God damn it.","response":"DM: Up to a minute. So probably would have faded by now."}
{"prompt":"SAM: God damn it.","response":"DM: Sorry. What are you doing, Scanlan?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Really, it's the door's fault.\nSAM: Shit. I'll just Lightning Bolt her. Him. It. Whatever it is.","response":"DM: Okay. So you release a bolt of lightning energy right in its direction. Go ahead and roll damage for that."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, just damage?","response":"DM: You don't have to hit for lightning bolt; it just hits everything in front of it, and you have to try and avoid it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, 8d6.","response":"DM: What's the DC?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I get my hand cone?","response":"DM: It is a free action to pull it out, so you instinctively– hand cone, cast the spell– out the bolt goes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So, 19.","response":"DM: 19, okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 8d6.","response":"DM: Does not make its saving throw."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Great.\nTALIESIN: Need more d6, or are you cool?\nSAM: Nope, that's it. I just need help counting.\nMARISHA: That's good!\nSAM: 16, five, 21, 27.\nTALIESIN: 28, 29, 30. 34!\nSAM: 34.","response":"DM: 34 points of damage. The lightning blasts through her, not impactful as you think it might be. This entity because it is in an ethereal state, is not as effectively hit by such magics. However, it does take damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I will move back a bit. Away from the thing. And I will– Oh! We have people.\nMARISHA: Yay! Percy's unconscious!\nLAURA: No!\nTRAVIS: Keep fighting!\nMARISHA: It's okay, it's cool.\nLAURA: We've been listening in the car.\nTALIESIN: Okay, so you know.","response":"DM: Scanlan, you move back?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, and then I can, as a bonus action, still get a bonus? I will heal him, this doofus here.\nTALIESIN: I didn't do anything!","response":"DM: Healing Word."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah, but maybe I should do it at a–\nTALIESIN: Just get me up. It's okay.\nSAM: Just get you up? Okay. 1d4 plus something?\nMARISHA: Do it.\nSAM: Two plus whatever. Six? Eight?\nMARISHA: I think it's plus your spell level.","response":"DM: Healing Word will be–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's 1d4 plus five, so it's seven points.","response":"DM: So, seven hit points. You're conscious, but you're still on the ground, face down, loosely fallen over the stuff on the altar."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I don't get my turn until next round.","response":"DM: Correct. So, Scanlan? Your turn's done? Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, oh! That, oh, okay. No. So, I'm going to walk, thanks. I'm going to slide up the wall along where Scanlan is. Towards Scanlan. And another thing I realized, I haven't clicked my Boots of Haste, so I wouldn't have been able to do whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, anyway. And I'm still not going to. But I'm pulling out my Flametongue Dagger and now I'm throwing Keen Dagger, Flametongue. First one is 26.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And the second one is 23.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. First attack gets 11.\nLIAM: And the second attack gets eight.\nLIAM: I'm going to, without doing any dash or anything, because I can't, I'm going to move as far as I can just going kitty-corner. Behind Scanlan, walking along the wall.","response":"DM: Over here?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Absolutely.","response":"DM: That far?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, that's as far as I can get, that's good.\nTALIESIN: 18.","response":"DM: 18? Okay. As its hand reaches down and passes through, as you just come to consciousness, and you start getting yourself up, you look up and feel this cold sensation as its hand reaches through your back and seems to almost grasp your spine. Your whole body lurches from the impact. You take 12 points of necrotic damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm back to zero.\nSAM: That's two!\nLIAM: It starts over.\nSAM: It does?\nTALIESIN: Yeah. I'm back to zero.\nSAM: If he dies once, comes back and dies again, is that two?","response":"DM: No, he has to fail his death saves."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I just woke up and went, (groans). Passed back out again.","response":"DM: That ends its turn. Well, no actually, it's going to start moving now. It's going to drift through the rest of its movement this direction. That ends its turn. Go ahead and make your death saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes, 19.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Yay, little snitch.\nSAM: Hey, should we leave?\nLIAM: No, we should kill this thing!\nLIAM: We're not going to be able to run. This thing flew in here on the breeze.\nSAM: I don't think Eyebite's going to work against it. So, fuck, I'll cast Bigby's Hand at 6th-level, then.\nTRAVIS: Has that ever been done?\nSAM: I don't have any more 5th-level slots. So, I'm just going to make it even bigger.\nSAM: I don't even know what it does.\nLIAM: Fingers going out the windows of the church like Alice in Wonderland.\nSAM: Okay.","response":"DM: So if you're going to punch it, it does an additional 2d8 damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes, I think–","response":"DM: What are you going to do?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to bitch-slap it, but the forceful hand. So I can just push it far away from us. Possibly to the front door.","response":"DM: Okay, I see. So it does no damage but it does force its movement."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, and I'll say because you did it at a higher level, it's an additional five feet of movement on that. So, as the hand shoves toward the creature–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It takes no damage for that?","response":"DM: The forceful hand it doesn't, no. There's grasping hand and the clenched fist do damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 14. Plus, what am I adding? Oh, nine. Plus nine.","response":"DM: 14 plus nine? That hits. Go ahead and roll damage. That's 6d8 force damage because you cast it at 6th level."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 6d8. I don't even know what those are. That's a ten.\nLIAM: They look like diamonds.\nSAM: There they go. I got one. I'll just roll it six times.\nLAURA: No, diamonds are Vex's best friend.\nSAM: 24?","response":"DM: 24."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Even at 6th-level, that's all it did.","response":"DM: Yeah. As that happens, the fist clenches and (wham) bitch-slaps the back of the wailing ghost creature. As it does you hear it scream out in pain (screech) as its spectral form is scattered across the air and dissipates."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What?\nMARISHA: Thank god.\nSAM: What?\nTRAVIS: I think you smashed it.\nMARISHA: You killed it.\nLIAM: You crushed it.\nSAM: But I'm so little and wee!\nLIAM: Lift yourself up for a victory lap.\nSAM: Yes, I lift myself up with Bigby's Hand. Yeah, that was a great idea.","response":"DM: You toss yourself up a couple times."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Whoa!\nTRAVIS: Meanwhile, Percy's unconscious.\nSAM: Oh shit! Percy!\nLIAM: No, I've got four healing potions. I pour, it's not the best. It's a greater healing?","response":"DM: So, it's 4d4 plus four."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I will also sing for him a Song of Rest, which is just another d6.","response":"DM: If you guys are taking a short rest–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah. Oh, are we clear of danger?\nLIAM: We don't know, but I poured the potion into Percy's mouth.\nTALIESIN: 4d4 plus four?","response":"DM: Yep, you got it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Four, five, six, seven, nine, ten, 14. Yep. I'm awake. Hurt, but–\nLIAM: I slap him twice, anyway.\nTALIESIN: Ugh! Ah!\nLIAM: What do we do?\nSAM: What are we doing here?\nLIAM: The priest's dead. Is there anyone else, or should we head back?\nTALIESIN: We should head back. Apparently, any help I thought we'd find here is obviously gone.\nSAM: Should we check this other room first, before we go?\nTALIESIN: Did we not check the other room?\nSAM and LIAM: No.\nTALIESIN: Let's check the other room, and–\nSAM: Quickly, though, quickly.\nTALIESIN: We'll check the other room quickly.\nLIAM: While they check the room, I'm going to go all over the altar and see if there's anything, any hidden door, any trapdoor, anything like that.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Eh. That's a– oh! No! Wait, I keep forgetting that's a rogue skill. That's a 20.\nTALIESIN: I was really hoping you missed that part.","response":"DM: Looking over the altar, it appears to be smooth, solid stone. Nothing catches your attention. You check the other room. This is a small kitchen, essentially, for whoever was running here would make small meals or things to delineate during worship and/or just cook for its own meals when the father was keeping–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Has it been used recently? Is it–","response":"DM: It does not appear to have been used, you can make an investigation check to gather an idea of how long it's been there."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to look around as well and food and stuff.\nTALIESIN: 12.\nSAM: 22.","response":"DM: Okay. You get the feeling that the last time this was used was a little under a week ago."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Any provisions that we can take? Water, food?","response":"DM: You find a couple of loaves of stale bread, some dried meats, salted dry meats, like some jerky-ish type things. Things that are meant to last a while. There is produce here, but the produce has long wilted and gone to rot."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have theories on who's been using this space. Is there anything that would clue me in to who's been using this space?","response":"DM: It's hard to really tell. You're not too familiar with lifestyles of different individuals. Whoever left the notes, and whoever was dabbling with the vicinity does have a tendency towards sciences and alchemy in ways that seemingly can blend and overlap with your specialty. That's the best you can ascertain, based on the information given."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Now, here's the question. Do we leave them a sign that we're here, or do we hope that they don't notice?\nSAM: Well, let's leave them a sign. We're supposed to be sowing discontent, right? So, let's leave a sign that someone was here and fucked up their shit. Do you want me to pee on the altar?\nTALIESIN: No.\nLIAM: I take my dagger, and I go to the altar–\nTALIESIN: Wait.\nSAM: No, don't leave your dagger; it's your only one left.\nLIAM: I didn't say I'm leaving it. Yeah. You want that?\nTALIESIN: I want that.\nLIAM: I start– would you hand me that scrap of paper, yeah?\nSAM: Whoa, this is our sign?\nLIAM: So I start carving this– Is this Pelor?\nTALIESIN: This is not Pelor. It's part of the crest of de Rolo.\nLAURA: Ooh!\nMARISHA: de Rolos are back!\nLIAM: Okay. So, I just start scraping it into the stone with the Keen Dagger.","response":"DM: Okay. And it gives a horrible screeching sound as you carve into this well-polished stone surface that's used predominantly for worship, or when it was. Given about five, ten minutes in you manage to scrape a design into it that is visually distinct against the smooth surface, and does match the design best to your ability that Percy–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I would also like to drag Father Reynal out of his room and put him at the pedestal.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And then before we go, I'm going to the wooden door, and I carve into the door: Pelor lives in Whitestone.\nSAM: That's a lot of words.\nMARISHA: Six hours later…\nLIAM: It's wood! It took me five minutes.","response":"DM: Okay. You finish your carving, seemingly without recurring incident."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Like to head back now, I believe.","response":"DM: Yeah. You guys make your way out of the temple back into the center of the graveyard. The sun is beginning to set. The reds and purples of the night sky are starting to creep in, as it just begins to crest on the far western side of the mountain range surrounding the valley."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I have a question.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What's the weather been like since we've been in Whitestone?","response":"DM: It's been spotty, cloudy–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The sun has come out during the daytime?","response":"DM: Bits and pieces. There is heavy cloud cover that seems to be pushing through. It brings colder weather. It looks like when you first got there, there was some snowfall that happened before you arrived. You've had a few days of sun, but I'd say about half the day is cloud cover."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Does it seem to be fairly natural weather for this time of year? Okay.\nLIAM: I also grab those wooden stakes off the ground.","response":"DM: Okay. Takes you a little time, because they're amongst a bunch of other broken wooden scraps–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I grab a couple extra, as well.","response":"DM: Okay! You find some splintered wood. You guys make your way back into the town. I'd like you all to make a stealth, or a deception check, if you prefer."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Deception, please. (sings a ditty) I'm just a peasant boy.\nTALIESIN: 13.","response":"DM: 13."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: G'day sir.\nLIAM: 23.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 32.\nTALIESIN: Yes?","response":"DM: “You new around here?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A bit, yes.","response":"DM: “I don't recognize you.” And two of the guards step forward."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I suppose it's our good luck, then.","response":"DM: “What's your name?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (sighs) Reggie.","response":"DM: Make a deception check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Fuck my life. I know! 21!\nLIAM: My name's Reggie.","response":"DM: “Then make yourself useful. Maybe you can make up for some of these lost crops that these bags of shite keep saying they can't do.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm actually supposed to be going back for a–","response":"DM: “I don't give a shit, move on, boy.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes, sir.\nLAURA: I'm cleaning my nails as I'm watching her.\nTALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye from the second floor. I want to see how much movement in the city there is and whether or not there's any guards by the tree, whether or not the tree seems to be left to its own devices.","response":"DM: Okay. As you're keeping watch, you notice occasionally there will be one of the zombie giants that will lumber through the center of town. There's a very specific pattern that they tend to follow."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Definitely trying to memorize that.","response":"DM: And you do notice a couple of other guards that you didn't notice during the day begin to show up. They're humanoid; they're armored. They sneak around. They're humanoid, but their movement is unnatural."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is there a lot of light in the town, or not very much light?","response":"DM: Not very much light at all. There's very low-lit points at certain crossroads that've been left up for general visibility for those who have to travel at night, but you gather most people just do not travel at night here in Whitestone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Make sure no lights are lit in our–\nTALIESIN: We've already blacked out–\nSAM: I blacked out the windows.\nLAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: Keyleth–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah?","response":"DM: You finally complete your ritual. Sweat pouring down your brow, you have your hand on the roots–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do something? Something real quick for my final, extra drama? So, as I complete the ritual, remembering that Pelor, and this is a sun tree. I'm going to cast my 6th-level Sunbeam spell as I'm finishing the Plant Growth with the last big essence–\nSAM: At night?\nMARISHA: I'm underground. So, I'm going to take my Sunbeam, and wrap it up with my druid goodness. And shove it in the tree.\nTALIESIN: You're going to shove it where the sun don't shine.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to kill it. I don't know if it's going to work or not.","response":"DM: Okay. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do I get advantage on this? Because of Heroes' Feast?","response":"DM: I would say no, because this isn't a saving throw and because what you're attempting to do is essentially convert a highly damaging spell into a non-damaging circumstance at the end of an eight-hour endurance match with a ritual. This is going to be a difficult attempt. So go ahead and roll a d20. Add your wisdom modifier."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I hope I didn't just fuck up by doing this.\nLAURA: You got it, Keyleth.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, you never get arrested or anything, you're good.\nSAM: Use the green one. This is you doing greenery.\nMARISHA: I'm so nervous.\nSAM: Natural 20. Easy. Or a six.\nLAURA: Oh, no.\nMARISHA: But my wisdom's not bad, so 12?","response":"DM: You complete the ritual and release the healing energy of your Plant Growth spell. As you release it you begin to concentrate on the sun ray and you begin to see, throughout the pieces of earth around, seeds quickly begin to germinate and small little bits of ivy, greenery begin to pierce out from parts of the earth in your immediate vicinity, as this affects a large radius. There does not appear to be any sort of immediate reaction by the tree. You begin to pull back and concentrate on the spell. You release the Sunbeam forward. In the frustration of the lack of reaction from the tree and the desperation to make sure some effect happens, you release the full force of the beam as opposed to the prequel aspect and you burst into some of the roots, blasting some of them apart and beginning to set flame to part of the under of the tree."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, cool. That's cool. Cool story.\nLIAM: Bucket of water.\nMARISHA: I'll put it out.","response":"DM: You guys hear this (explosion)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's right in front of– I pull out my cloaks in my bag and start trying to put out the flames. Keyleth, what? Was that supposed to happen? Is that good? Was this good? Should I stop? I keep putting out the flames.","response":"DM: You put out the flames. And you notice where the fire had burned aspects of the wood, there is the black char marks across the roots where the flames touched, and the area surrounding the root is a little more of a vibrant brown color. Almost like a little hint of life seemed to have seeped into the root."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh my god.","response":"DM: It expands for a moment and you can see a little bit of life return to that localized section of the tree."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ooh! Like starting a fire. (blows air) Go, go! Can I Druidcraft? Come on!","response":"DM: As you do, there's still these bits of ivy greenery, this long-embedded seeds through years and years and generations of earth layering in here. These long-dormant seeds are starting to come to life and spring through the earth around you. The expansion of the healthier portion of the root begins to spread, and then stop spreading. And you begin to notice all the greenery begins to immediately wither and crumple and turn to ash. And you watch as the vibrant aspect of the roots slowly drain from the bottom up. Like something is pulling the life force out of the roots."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They're sucking the life force out of the earth.\nMARISHA: I take some of that holy oil that Vax gave me and I dip my finger in it and start rubbing it along the vines that are growing along the edge of the roots.","response":"DM: You take the holy oil and place it along the roots, and it soaks into the dry and in some cases now charred aspects of the roots. You wait a moment, and the oil seems to almost burn off and evaporate."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So, the ground is cursed.\nMARISHA: The ground is cursed.\nSAM: Well, poo.\nTRAVIS: Should I try peeing on it?","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Perception check?\nTALIESIN: That thing you hate doing?\nMARISHA: No, I'm good at perceiving things, I'm just not good at reading people.\nSAM: You know what we need to do?\nMARISHA: That's not bad. 23?\nSAM: Hydroponics. No ground, just grow it above.","response":"DM: The pattern of decay that followed your initial attempt at reviving this vicinity, all had a very distinct downward motion of draining. There was something about the ground, something beneath the tree and where you are that is seemingly taking the life force of the surroundings."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, my god, what if the vampire thing is right underneath us?\nMARISHA: I was going to say, can I still see the green being sucked down a bit?","response":"DM: At this point, all the life force was very quickly drained."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I use my Primeval Awareness and sense any sort of vampiric presence within our very close vicinity?","response":"DM: What's the radius on that?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's a minute. It's up to six miles if I spend six minutes.","response":"DM: Okay. So you take your time, and you begin to focus and it expands. As you do, focusing on vampiric presence, you feel a fair amount of presence: above, below and further north. And smattered throughout the city. You get the sensation at this point in time that there is much more beyond just Lord Briarwood that have come to be a creature of the night in this city."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) That's good. Bad. Probably bad.\nTRAVIS: Maybe they're not below the tree, maybe it's just the soil.\nTALIESIN: The ground is tainted.\nMARISHA: I'm exhausted.\nSAM and TALIESIN: Let's sleep.\nLAURA: We're just going to sleep? Surrounded by vampires, we're just going to sleep surrounded by lots and lots of vampires?\nTALIESIN: I'm going to tinker for a moment on my glove with that thing I talked about.","response":"DM: Okay. Make an intelligence check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: An intelligence check?","response":"DM: Yeah, just a straight intelligence check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 14.","response":"DM: 14. Incorporating this organic organ? Keeping it from rotting is already going to be a feat. In order to incorporate any of its natural charge essence is going to require your workshop. Doing that on the go is too intricate."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I just wanted to think about it. It's fine.","response":"DM: I mean, it may be functional. It's definitely possible to use what you extracted from the behir to be a way to charge your Diplomacy, but that is something that you'll have to do in a controlled space when you have everything at your disposal. It's a very delicate process to even attempt it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I think we get it.\nLIAM: I'll take first watch.","response":"DM: Okay. You all take an evening's rest."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm sorry I couldn't fix the tree, you guys.\nTALIESIN: We learned a lot.\nLAURA: You even did that awesome fire thing at the end that was really, really cool.\nMARISHA: Thanks. I was afraid I was going to permanently kill it for a second.\nTALIESIN: We know it's not dead dead. That it's just tainted.\nSAM: Guys, I just want to say that I killed a door and a banshee, so–\nLAURA: Really?\nSAM: Yeah.\nLAURA: Nice, Scanlan.\nSAM: The door was harder to kill.\nTRAVIS: That's some door!\nTALIESIN: It's okay. I think I figured out what we have to do first.\nMARISHA: What do we have to do first?\nTALIESIN: I think we have to kill Kerrion Stonefell.\nSAM: Who's that?\nTALIESIN: It's the one that everyone– he's the one managing all of the goods and all of the farming.\nSAM: Is that who they were talking about today? The group?\nLAURA: Where is he at?\nSAM: Oh, Sir Kerrion. I thought they said something else.\nTALIESIN: Kerrion Stonefell. He's in one of the three– I would assume that he's been given one of the three mansions in town.\nSAM: You think if we find him, kill him, and leave his body on some sort of public display, it would sow some seeds of rebellion?\nTALIESIN: I think it would be the beginning. He's who everybody's afraid of.\nTRAVIS: We could hang him in the tree.\nTALIESIN: We could hang him in the tree.\nSAM: We could. Grog, could you do something nasty to his body?\nTRAVIS: Just say the word.\nLAURA: Oh, this is messed up.\nTRAVIS: Do we check the mansions for him?\nTALIESIN: I think we ask around to see if there's a way to ask around to find out who's in what house.\nSAM: Ask around? Let's just go house to house and kill everyone in all of them!\nTALIESIN: Let's– Eventually, yes.\nTRAVIS: Hello. I'd like to share the news of our Lord and Savior: my axe in your face!\nSAM: Yes. We could be Mormons.","response":"DM: As you guys take your watches and go to sleep in the cold interior, and it is a cold interior of the tavern. As the night comes through, this is your first time really staying the night in the center of Whitestone. Even though you slept in the forest, in the boughs of the trees itself, the temperature grows far colder here, and even with the warm interior, the windows frost over and you find yourselves having to huddle or build some sort of small fire to even keep a semblance of comfort to rest. You all eventually go to sleep throughout your various times. I would like everyone to make a wisdom saving throw. With advantage, because you're still affected by the Heroes' Feast."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Until noon tomorrow, right?\nMARISHA: 2PM tomorrow.\nSAM: Yeah!\nTALIESIN: 12.\nSAM: 17.\nMARISHA: 25.\nLIAM: 20.\nLAURA: 23.\nTRAVIS: 14.","response":"DM: Okay. All of you wake the next morning rested as best as can be. Percy, your entire evening was wracked with nightmare after nightmare, imagery you wish to not recall. Whispers and voices familiar, unfamiliar, seeing yourself pulled from your physical self into the heart of this banshee, then wrest from death, barely, cackling in the distance. I want you to go ahead and mark on your sheet one point of corruption."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.\nTRAVIS: What does that mean?\nMARISHA: Oh no!\nSAM: I don't even know where that is on the sheet!\nLAURA: He could be evil. We could turn evil here!","response":"DM: As you wake up, you find yourself wracked by those nightmares, a sense of nervousness comes to you. And there's a tremor to your voice now that's uncontrollable. At times of silence, you find yourself impulsively clearing your throat. And with that we're going to take a five-minute break."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What the fuck?!\nTALIESIN: Yay!\nLIAM: See you in 17.\nTRAVIS: Damn!\nLIAM: Damn, damn!\nTRAVIS: Skittles, motherfucker!","response":"DM: It's pretty fantastic. So, as soon as we hit hat we'll have our next giveaway and a big celebration as we hit 10k."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Get yourself a double cheeseburger.","response":"DM: Also, you guys just caught, as that break ended, a quick episode of Omnibus. Omnibus is a new show that shows here every Tuesday. It's  helmed by Ian and Hector, some of our fantastic hosts here. It talks about all sorts of things. Not just Batman things. All sorts of things in geek culture and– what's that?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: There's more than Batman?\nMARISHA: You feeling okay?\nTALIESIN: (grunts)\nMARISHA: It was cold. Did you catch a cold?\nTALIESIN: No, I'm fine.\nMARISHA: Is your throat ticklish?\nTALIESIN: A little ticklish, I'm fine.\nMARISHA: Do you want some Goodberries? It might help a little bit–\nLAURA: Keyleth.\nMARISHA: What?\nTALIESIN: I'll take some Goodberries.\nSAM: “Logenzes?”\nMARISHA: Well, shut up.\nLIAM, SAM, and MARISHA: Kenny Logenzes.","response":"DM: It's a whole business opportunity that was missed."}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And not a donkey.\nLIAM: But he's indoors with us, right?\nLAURA: Yeah. I've been laying on him all night.\nTRAVIS: Man, that was a good night's sleep. Who do we get to kill today?\nSAM: Sir Kerrion.\nTRAVIS: How many mansions are there?\nTALIESIN: There's three.\nTRAVIS: Right. One, three.\nLIAM: Do you know which one he lives in?\nTALIESIN: I don't.\nLIAM: Shit.\nSAM: Only one way to find out. Burn every house down except for those three mansions and see who runs out.\nTRAVIS: I like it. Seconded.\nTALIESIN: I also think perhaps we should find a new place to sleep tonight. I think it might be best. To mix it up. Keep moving.\nTRAVIS: But I've been peeing in the corner.\nLAURA: That's why it smells like it does. Grog!\nTRAVIS: What? Look, it's like they did in the old days, they had chamberpots. I mean, I have my corner. It's my recreation corner. Sorry. Yeah, that's my brand.\nLIAM: That is ripe. We're leaving.\nSAM: You want to all be peasants again? Can we not just disguise ourselves in tattered clothes?\nLAURA: I have a bear. Do you want to disguise the bear?\nSAM: Oh, wait. We could just leave the bear behind.\nLAURA: In the house.\nSAM: He could guard this safe house, and then we could go find another safe house.\nTALIESIN: Scanlan, cast the spell.","response":"DM: You're a little boy. Jovial boy without a yo-yo."}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So we're going to go to Beyond the Horizon.","response":"DM: Going to Beyond the Horizon?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.\nSAM: Is there a basement?\nLAURA: Yeah, secret doors? Can I use a perception check to see if there's any kind of secret entrances in the rubble at all? Something that leads to a cellar?","response":"DM: Do you wander into the building? You guys are still on the outside–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How collapsed is it?","response":"DM: The whole building is still standing. It just looks like the front entrance is caved in and the doors were pulled off."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'll just old lady walk into the building and look around.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll go in with her.\nTALIESIN: Do old ladies lick the air?\nLAURA: Yeah, she does. This crazy-eyed old lady does.\nLIAM: Yeah, the eyes, they never go in the same direction; one's always to the left and one to the right.","response":"DM: Looking about the inside, most of the furniture has been broken or taken. You can see a bunch of shelves set up as this was once a curiosity shop. Empty. Anything of worth has long been taken."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oi, Grandma! Any yo-yos in there?\nLAURA: I'm looking, boy.","response":"DM: A large scattering of broken glass, and a peppering of stains. Dark, ruddy stains across the hardwood floors you can see spattered in places. Occasional rat seems to crawl out in the distance a little (rat squeaking) sound. But there is no other sign of life within the interior. Go ahead and make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh, with no advantage, right?\nMARISHA: What time is it?\nSAM: Oh, until noon.\nMARISHA: Until 2PM, yo!","response":"DM: Wisdom check, not saving throw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, never mind.\nLIAM: 13.","response":"DM: 13?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 13.\nLAURA: That would have been an eight.","response":"DM: Eight. Okay. You take a while pushing through some of the rubble, checking behind the main desk, if you will, as to where most purchases would have taken place. The place is cleared out, and looks like it's covered in enough dust to have been left here for the better part of six months to a year."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I can't see any kind of like door that leads to a cellar?","response":"DM: Glancing about, you find what looks to be a small cellar door that opens up in the floor in one of the back rooms. You open it up, there's a small ladder, not even a staircase, a ladder that leads down in there. It's a small room, about ten foot by ten foot. That room is also entirely cleaned out."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thanks, grandmama.\nTALIESIN: Can we use this as a base of operations in the moment, then?\nLAURA: But it's half-collapsed, it would not be very protected.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we're fully exposed.\nSAM: Let's just take a walkabout and see if there's anything else around the area.\nTRAVIS: Do you want to head in one of the directions of the mansions?\nTALIESIN: Let's head to the closest mansion.","response":"DM: Okay. So you skirt back towards the crossroad, the nearest crossroad that heads northward to the very, very far northwest section of Whitestone. There you come to this noble house, which has a nice bronzed fence around the outside of it. Probably about seven feet tall with these intricate spears affixed to the top, almost in a fleur-de-lis type pattern, but looks sharp enough to keep anyone from trying to leap over. The front gate is currently chained off with a lock on it. There is a lawn, but the lawn itself appears to be frost-crusted from the evening's moisture and cold temperature. What grass is there is very gray and dull and currently crisp with a white frost dew. Is a slight hill, and you do see the building itself. It's a very nice building. It's a deep brown. A lot of it appears to be like natural stained wood from the local forest surrounding Whitestone, with highlights of deep green and black. There does not appear to be any immediate sign of life from the inside, but there does appear to be a light coming from the inside, so even at this point in the day, it can be dark on the interior. You can see a little bit of light coming from one of the doors."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is there a mailbox with a name?\nSAM: Are there guards out front or anything, or is it just a gate?","response":"DM: It's just a gate, currently."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do you want me to go in?\nLAURA: What if we went to the fields and we asked other peasants how we report to what's-his-fuck. Keron. Keron?\nTALIESIN: Kerrion.\nLAURA: Kerrion?\nTRAVIS: Oh. That's actually a good one.\nTALIESIN: I will say, chances that anybody in any of these buildings is somebody we're going to want to take care of is very high.\nLAURA: So, just bust on in and kill them right now.\nSAM: Just, whoever's in there?\nMARISHA: Is that actually what you're saying?\nLIAM: And you went from focusing on Kerrion, to kicking in doors?\nLAURA: Yeah, you look a little pale, Percy.\nTALIESIN: I am a little pale.\nMARISHA: It's kind of like the game show problem.\nSAM: Well, you know.\nLAURA: Are you sick? Does Keyleth need to cast, I don't know, Restoration on you or something?\nTALIESIN: I just had a bad night's sleep, that's all.\nTRAVIS: Scanlan, go knock on that door.\nMARISHA: Do you have a fever?\nSAM: I'm just a little peasant boy.\nMARISHA: Is he running a fever?","response":"DM: He is not actually, he's quite cold and clammy."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ew.\nTALIESIN: My nice jacket. We can ask around. See if we can manage to ask somebody without arousing–\nSAM: Is anyone else on the street?","response":"DM: Right now, in this particular area, there is nobody on the street. You passed a few folks. A lot of them seem to be traveling southward."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How far are we from the temple? The Alcove?","response":"DM: The Alcove is a little further east, it's probably about a 15-minute walk. The other temple, that one is about a ten-minute walk south of here. It's closer to the southwestern side of the city."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We could take a walk to the Lady's Chamber and see if we run into anybody there or on the way, and it's only ten minutes out of the way.\nTRAVIS: The Lady's Chamber?\nTALIESIN: Not as exciting as it sounds.\nLIAM: You know someone there?\nTALIESIN: (sighs) It's not looking like it.\nSAM: I bet it's empty. I mean, it's a temple. The other one was.\nSAM: I thought so, too.\nTALIESIN: We'll get to it.\nSAM: I can just pop in there and see who's in there and pop out.\nLAURA: Be killed? Never pop back out again.\nTALIESIN: He doesn't know what he looks like, anyway.\nSAM: I'm just a peasant boy. You wouldn't kill a harmless peasant boy.\nTALIESIN: I think they would, actually. They already have.\nLAURA: We saw the tree.\nTALIESIN: Genuine proof that they are perfectly fine killing a small peasant boy.\nLIAM: What is there in the way of guards out in the open now, and those giants strolling about?","response":"DM: The skulking humanoids you saw last night that were wandering the streets? None of them visible. You do take in that far down the road to the east of you there is a large shape looming around the corner in a shadow stretching across the road. And you hear the distant (muffled stomping noise)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Are we within eyeshot of that thing right now?","response":"DM: Not yet. It looks like it's coming around a corner at the bend of the road a ways to the east."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is there anyone our size, any humanoid guards around?\nTRAVIS: No.\nLIAM: Nothing?","response":"DM: Currently? No."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm guessing the best time to sneak into any of these places is during the day.\nMARISHA: Do we want to sneak in, though? You're the only one who knows what they look like.","response":"DM: It's coming around the bend."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, wait. Are the gates locked?\nSAM: Let's get out of here. Take a walk, we're going to take a walk.\nTALIESIN: We're going to take a little walk and let it pass by. Let's go to the Lady's Chamber.\nLIAM: Lady's Chambers, anyone?\nSAM: Towards the Lady's Chamber. We're not going in.\nLIAM: It's full of prostitutes, Grog. Full.\nTALIESIN: You'll see. It's not really that complicated.\nLIAM: What did you roll?\nSAM: Have we passed any people?","response":"DM: If you're keeping an eye out for that, yes. In some of the alleyway, you do pass a couple that are holding some, what looks like either scavenged groceries or some sort of food they have keeping close to themselves."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I go talk to them?","response":"DM: You can, indeed."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to come with you.\nSAM: Oi, excuse me? My papa sent me to send a present, a gift of sorts, to a Sir Keri? Kurion?\nLAURA: Kerrion?\nSAM: Kerrion?\nLAURA: Kerrion?\nSAM: We're just looking to see where we can deliver the gift.","response":"DM: Make a deception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Scanlan's forte. Come on.\nSAM: 29.","response":"DM: You both stop and the man gives her a look like he's trying to usher her along, pulling her arm and she goes, “No, honey, it's just a child.” Walks up and leans forward and says, “If you're looking for Sir Kerrion, you'll find him in the extravagant abode to the southeast of the city.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: The one right over there?","response":"DM: “No.” And gives you a side look for a second and says, “You don't want to go find the Countess there. If you're looking for Sir Kerrion, you go to the southeast. Look for the brick building. That's where he stays. Near the farming area south of us. You're not from here are you?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're new to town.\nSAM: She's blind.\nSAM: Okay. I just need to bring him this sack of presents, or my papa will whip me pretty bad.\nTALIESIN: TMI.","response":"DM: “Then perhaps you could do that quickly.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You're so pretty and clean.","response":"DM: She blushes for a second, goes like, “You stay safe.” And brushes the hair out of your eyes for a second and pinches your cheek a little bit, and there's a look of sadness in her eyes, almost like, what horrible fate befalls this child, if he's not careful."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I smack him on the back of the head and say: Let's go boy! Keep up!\nSAM: I'm her seeing-eye boy.","response":"DM: She rushes back to the side of the man with her and, “See, it's fine. Good luck!” And they both dart off down the alley again."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sam Riegel, ladies and gentleman, he played Gavroche in Les Mis. Gavroche, right here, Gavroche.","response":"DM: On Broadway. Literally."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: He is Oliver Twist.\nTALIESIN: I was ready! I was ready.\nMARISHA: You said there was 40?","response":"DM: Four."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Four. Right.\nSAM: But they're allowed to assemble?","response":"DM: Yeah. There's four around him in the amphitheater. There are probably another ten or so scattered about the various ground surrounding it, just doing their own private prayer."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do I have an opinion on Yennen?","response":"DM: Yennen? From your previous experience and what you've heard is a very– can be a bit arrogant in his worship, but not in a way that is considered dangerous or impactful to when the de Rolo families were in rule. He does good for the people. Kind of a tool at times. But he practices well and he keeps the people's spirits up for those who worship."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We found him a bit obnoxious to our means and ends on occasion?","response":"DM: On occasion, but mostly just his personality. Nothing he's done personally. He's not a bad person, by any means. He's just, you know."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: He's also not a lapdog.","response":"DM: Yeah. Strong-willed in his ideas."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we insight check him to see if it seems like he's changed at all, or if he's still that same douchebag or if he's–","response":"DM: You would have no basis of comparison. You would be the only one that has."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up to the little meeting. Is it wrapping up right now?","response":"DM: It seems like it's winding down. He finishes the discussion about the bonds of community, speaks about this city sprang up from nothing, but has a greater destiny to itself. If not here at Whitestone, one day we will all go past these boundaries, these borders, and create our own cities. There is hope for this. And then begins to go into a couple of familiar prayers tailored specifically to the Erathis way of thinking, and then finishes and everyone looks up, bows their heads for a second and begin to stand up and walk away from the amphitheater as he turns around and begins to clear off one of the back benches for him to sit on."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to just walk up and start a conversation.","response":"DM: Okay. You walk up to him, he sits down. “Can I help you?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do you think there's any hope for Whitestone? Do you think there'll be a day the people can find happiness again?","response":"DM: “I can say this. If history has taught me anything, our people are a resilient bunch. There has been much death, opposition, to all the free peoples of these lands. And yet, they persevered and surmounted these odds. I think, though, to some degree a prison this town may have become, perhaps we ourselves cannot see the distant ends. It's easy to misinterpret the means of those that would oppress us. But we can't go too long before the world at large can see the  atrocities committed, the terrible entities that walk these streets.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do you think there will come a day that these people can seize freedom for themselves against their oppressors?","response":"DM: “I look forward to a day in which there can be a beacon of outside hope. From the inside, I fear many wills have been torn asunder. I'm sorry. Forgive my manners. Welcome to the Lady's Chamber. You are unfamiliar to me.” And he looks out at you guys standing at the peripheral of the amphitheater. “Travelers?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: “I fear the cold winter is looming. An ill omen takes this city, friends. You may stay to give worship, if you will, then I recommend you continue on your way. There is little here but dying tradition.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have a prayer to give.","response":"DM: “Interesting.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I pray for a day to come when outside forces can rally the people of Whitestone again. That strangers may come and bring with them salvation, and that the people will seize it.","response":"DM: “You speak in strange confidence for a traveler.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Look for signs, Keeper Yennen. Look for signs. I'm going to hand him a piece of parchment.","response":"DM: “Signs of what, I might ask?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Salvation. Good day to you, sir.\nLIAM: Act cool. Everybody act cool.\nTALIESIN: We walk south.\nTRAVIS: We walk south. We leave.\nTALIESIN: And you know what I've left him.","response":"DM: Yeah. As you're walking away, you hear his voice call out after. “Wait! What does this mean?” He pulls the parchment forward, revealing the symbol of the top of the de Rolo family crest."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That… (sighs) What appears dead may not necessarily be death. And that with the shadow of death over the city perhaps there is life deep underground. Perhaps things that appeared ended and gone are perhaps continuing to this day. And may rise again.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a persuasion check. Give you advantage on this."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 16.","response":"DM: Nods his head slowly, looks back at the sheet. Looks back at you with a discerning look."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: He's definitely not going to–","response":"DM: Oh, not at all. You look like a dirty peasant right now. Takes it and hastily closes it and folds it and puts it in the pouch. Steps back over and gathers some of his loose tea leaves– he was making himself some tea– and looks about shiftily, calls over one of the other worshipers and begins talking with them as you guys walk away."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's head south.\nTRAVIS: South it is.\nSAM: To the–\nLAURA: To the house?\nSAM: To the house.\nTALIESIN: Kerrion Stonefell's stately manor.\nMARISHA: So wait, which mansion were we at?\nSAM and LAURA: The Countess.\nTALIESIN: Countess Anna Ripley.\nMARISHA: Which mansion is that out of the three?\nTALIESIN: That's the northeastern one.\nMARISHA: That's the northeastern one?\nLAURA: And she was which? Who was the Countess again?\nTALIESIN: I'm assuming if it is who I suspect it is, it's Countess Anna Ripley.\nSAM: And who is she to you?\nTALIESIN: She is a terrible person.\nSAM: Wait, she's the one who killed a bunch of your people, right?\nMARISHA: She's the doctor, right?\nTALIESIN: She's the doctor.\nLAURA: Oh, she is the one!\nTRAVIS: Do we get to kill her?\nTALIESIN: I hope so. But let's– one at a time. If we're lucky, maybe one a day.\nMARISHA: Well, okay.\nTRAVIS: Like a vitamin?\nSAM: Like a Flintstone's vitamin. Except it's assassination.\nTALIESIN: (coughs)\nSAM: Do you need some healing? Are you okay?\nTALIESIN: I'm fine. I'm fine.\nSAM: Scanlan can make you feel good.\nTALIESIN: I'm fine.\nLAURA: Can I go up and ask Keyleth, outside of his earshot, to maybe cast some sort of restoration on him, without– He's fighting it. I don't think he's feeling well. Can you heal him?\nMARISHA: I'm mean, yeah. He's going to feel it once I cast it on him, but I can try.\nLAURA: He looks cold and kind of slimy, and he's coughing a lot.\nTRAVIS: Wow, that's harsh. Looks cold.\nSAM: He's probably been up tinkering all night.\nLIAM: Who are you to talk, Crazy Eyes?\nLAURA: I know.\nTALIESIN: I look like a dirty peasant right now.\nLAURA: No, that's true.\nMARISHA: I don't know if my– I don't know if Greater Restoration will work.\nTALIESIN: Should only take 20 minutes to get to the house, shouldn't it?","response":"DM: Yeah. Approximately."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're not passing anything interesting on the way, are we?\nSAM: Any other safe houses? Potential candidates?","response":"DM: I mean, there are plenty of houses that currently don't show signs of life."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I was thinking mostly of the barracks or the Alcove.\nSAM: Yes, but after we kill this thing, we're going to need to know where to go.\nTALIESIN: Got some thoughts.\nSAM: Thoughts? We need a place to retreat to immediately.\nTALIESIN: The Lady's Chamber.\nSAM: It's an amphitheater isn't it?\nTALIESIN: There's quarters. They'll be able to hide us.\nMARISHA: What makes you think they're going to hide us?\nTALIESIN: Hunch.\nSAM: Shouldn't we have a backup plan, in case they turn us out onto the street?\nTALIESIN: Actually, my thought was if we take care of Stonefell, why don't we hide in his house?\nLAURA: Nobody will know, right? Let's do it!\nSAM: That's a good plan. They probably have some good wine.\nTRAVIS: I always wanted to be a lord.\nMARISHA: Percy? I don't mean to beat a dead horse or anything, but–\nTALIESIN: If it would make you feel better, you can do whatever you like, but I think it's just a tickle.\nMARISHA: No. You're sure about all of this?\nSAM: They also have technology, now. They have weapons, guns, that they're developing. It could be a threat to many, many other people.\nMARISHA: Well, that I'm fine with. No, not that I'm fine with. I mean, I'm fine helping prevent that. I'm just more worried about your sanity than anything else.\nTALIESIN: I've got a hold. And I respect that if you think that I'm slipping, you'll let me know.\nMARISHA: Okay. You followed me into the fiery abyss, so–\nTALIESIN: If that isn't a sign that I must be crazy, I don't know what is.\nMARISHA: Touché. I'll follow you, though. I'll follow you to the end.\nSAM: As the oldest among us, I say that he's fine.\nTALIESIN: Are you actually the oldest among us?\nSAM: Well, I assume so. How old are you people?\nLAURA: What?\nTRAVIS: Me?\nSAM: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Somewhere between one and 50.\nLIAM: Well, I'm 27, but I don't know how old she is.","response":"DM: And with that, rainfall begins to hit upon the city–"}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Once around?\nMARISHA: Does it look like it's going to pass soon?","response":"DM: No. It looks like it's probably going to be here for most of the day at the very least."}
{"prompt":"SAM: The rain will dampen the screams from inside. So we go around once? Once around?","response":"DM: Okay. Perception checks all around."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Perception check.\nLIAM: I'm looking specifically for ways in the building other than the front door.\nSAM: I'm looking for clouds because I rolled a two.\nTRAVIS: Four.\nTALIESIN: 21.\nLAURA: 24.\nLIAM: 20.\nMARISHA: 21.\nMARISHA: Like candlelight?","response":"DM: Like candlelight or lantern light, the darkened exterior has made most of the sunlight that would warm a building or light it up from the inside has been cut off by the rainstorm. So, there is a necessity for internal lighting."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is there any sign of windows that are blacked out?","response":"DM: No, but you do notice that one of the windows to the far back side of the building where most of the light's coming from– occasionally the light does seem to shift or a shadow moves past it. There's movement within that room nearish that window."}
{"prompt":"SAM: They're watching TV.\nLAURA: Probably. I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.\nSAM: Ooh, thank you!\nMARISHA: Are we going through the cellar?\nSAM: Is our meal still affecting us?\nTALIESIN: Until two.\nSAM: Yes! Let's go in quick!\nLAURA: Is it possible to see what the movement is, who it is inside that window?","response":"DM: Not from this 25 to 30-foot distance from the building and you guys trying to be inconspicuous."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: There's nothing between us and the building?","response":"DM: There is the gate. The gate, and what looks to be a few rocks and a couple small trees that are on the actual grounds of the house surrounding it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is the cellar door hidden from view of everything or is it out in the open?","response":"DM: Which one?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The cellar door that we saw.","response":"DM: The cellar door is out in the open, buttressed against the back of the house. It's up against the ground on the side. It has two doors that open up and lead into the cellar below."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does it look like anybody can see us?","response":"DM: From where you're standing? No. You're going to be hardpressed to get across without being in sight of somebody if someone were nearby."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We're between a fence, right?","response":"DM: You're on the outside of a fence."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do we want to try to draw them out or get to the cellar? Either way, those two thug guards are going to die.\nMARISHA: There are guards?\nLAURA and SAM: There's two guards.","response":"DM: They're currently not in visual range of you. They're guarding the front of the building. You guys moved around back. So you don't see the two guards currently on the opposite side of the house."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What's the fence made out of? Is it the spear-y shit?\nMARISHA: Is it poky up top?","response":"DM: It is poky. yes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It is poky.","response":"DM: It's not super sharp poky, but there's iron rods."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So, I could throw Scanlan over.\nLIAM: If you roll a two, you can get hurt.","response":"DM: Yeah, if you rolled poorly, it's going to deal some damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Should we do a diversion for the guards?\nLAURA: They can't even see us, though!\nSAM: Yes, but once we go through the fence, they might. I don't know.\nTALIESIN: Let's try to sneak in and leave the guards there unless they notice us and then we'll just (thwip thwip).\nTRAVIS: How do we sneak in past them?\nTALIESIN: You want to try to pull one of the wrought irons off, maybe?\nTRAVIS: I'd be down for that.\nSAM: If I puffed some smoke, would it draw attention to us?\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nSAM: Okay, then never mind.\nTALIESIN: It's raining. We can make a little noise, it'll be okay.\nLIAM: Where are the guards in the front?","response":"DM: They're currently on the opposite side of the building. If you guys are looking at the back. They're in the front of the building guarding the front door."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Inside the gate at the house?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Want me to heat up that metal bar for you?\nLIAM: We still have to go over and in.\nTRAVIS: Sure.\nLAURA: Let's just up and over the bar, athletic it. Acrobatics it?\nLIAM: Grog, can you bend that shit open?","response":"DM: Your donkey's still there beside you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fuck!\nLIAM: Yeah, well, if Grog can frigging make a hole in there–\nTRAVIS: Can I try and Lou Ferrigno those bars?","response":"DM: You're more than welcome to. Go ahead and make a strength check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The bar that he's–\nTALIESIN: Lou Ferrigno-ing.\nMARISHA: – Lou Ferrigno-ing, I'm going to cast Heat Metal.\nSAM: Is that going to burn his hands?\nMARISHA: Put on some gloves.\nTRAVIS: I don't have any gloves.\nMARISHA: Spit in your hand a little bit. Grip and bear it.\nSAM: It's raining. It'll be fine.","response":"DM: So, you cast Heat Metal on the bars and a certain area of this gate begins to glow with a dull orange to become a brighter orange, and portions of it going whitish-hot in places."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Why don't you just hit it with something?\nLAURA: Wrap your hands.\nMARISHA: You can use your axe.","response":"DM: The rain, by the way, is puffing against it and evaporating as it impacts the now-heated metal."}
{"prompt":"SAM: But that'll be loud!\nMARISHA: You do you! You do you, Grog.\nTRAVIS: I rolled a 23.","response":"DM: 23? Okay, you reach over and grab it, your hands smoking on the– use the pain! Use the pain and pull down the bars. You get a large portion of the gate to actually bend downward into an arc, causing the whole gate to fold inward on that side, making it much easier for anyone to pass through. However, you do suffer nine points of fire damage from the burn and your hands are currently scalded."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Now we can get Trinket in!\nLIAM: That's a hangnail on his pinky toe.\nMARISHA: I go ahead and I cast Healing Word on his hands.","response":"DM: Okay. So it's 1d4 plus six. She's rolling it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ooh! 11.\nTRAVIS: Hey, back to full!","response":"DM: So, the scarring stays for a bit. You do smell the burning flesh, but there's no lasting wounds on your hands."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You can check to see if there's a lock on the cellar door?\nLIAM: Yeah, sure.\nTRAVIS: We gotta make it across the lawn first.\nLAURA: Well, we're in the back of the house.\nLIAM: Well, we're all just walking very quietly.\nLAURA: We're stealthing.","response":"DM: So, everyone make a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We have advantage?","response":"DM: No, everyone gets plus ten to their stealth. You have disadvantage on the stealth check, though."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Plus ten.","response":"DM: Yes, plus ten to your stealth roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 17.\nTRAVIS: 23.\nLIAM: 34.\nLAURA: 32.\nMARISHA: 34.\nTALIESIN: 26!\nLIAM: I'm going straight to the cellar door.\nLAURA: Up against the wall of the building.\nLIAM: I give it a little (clunk) to see what I feel.","response":"DM: It is locked. It does gives resistance."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I get to work.\nMARISHA: Do your thing.\nLAURA: I feel like it's been a while since you've done this.\nLIAM: Did what?\nLAURA: Lockpicking.\nLIAM: I already did it earlier when you weren't here. 14, that's 27.","response":"DM: 27. You reach over, without even looking. You grab the lock; you're familiar with this kind of lock. (clicking) You take the lock off the chain. The chains fall loose against the opposite side of the, or the inside of the door. You pull it open. It's dark inside. You can see the dry stone steps that lead down below the building as rain starts darkening them with drops that are hitting them."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I lean my head in really fast and just see if I can hear anything, and roll a one.\nLAURA: Could I stealth in a couple of steps look around and see if there's anybody in there, or hear anything?","response":"DM: Okay. Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, I said it's good! It's good! Let's go! Right? You agree. We're never wrong!\nLAURA: 19.","response":"DM: 19. Listening to the inside. The smell's a little musty, like a cellar you'd expect. But a little bit of dust and untouched earth. There's nothing down there; no movement, no sound."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's clear, let's go! Ish!","response":"DM: You all drop in. Darting into– which is good, because you notice around the corner one of the giants is turning the corner. You all dive inside, close the cellar doors. Bringing you to the interior."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I wonder if they're going to notice that fence.\nSAM: They might.","response":"DM: You hear the pattering of rain across the wooden doors of the cellar. You made your way down underneath. And it is pitch black. There is no light source down here."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I pull out my Flametongue Dagger.","response":"DM: Okay. A little bit of flame causes enough candlelight to see the surface. And it is a wine cellar."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I have Darkvision.\nMARISHA: I'll go ahead and use my flaming hands.","response":"DM: Okay, so with an instant of will, all of a sudden flames burst around–"}
{"prompt":"[no audio]","response":"DM: – is a small ladder in the corner that seems to lead up to a latched door that leads to the interior of the house."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I got up to it and listen.","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't hear anything, you guys. I think it's fine!\nLIAM: My ears are bigger than yours. Let me have a listen. Get down.\nLAURA: Yeah! Your ears are huge compared to mine!\nLIAM: Definitely, look at them!","response":"DM: Your sister assures you she heard–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: There's nothing there!\nLIAM: I don't hear anything, either. I think we should just bust in.\nSAM: Okay!\nTRAVIS: Wait.\nTALIESIN: (whispers) Quietly!\nMARISHA: Wait, hang on! Grog just said wait!\nLIAM: I keep forgetting the rogue skill, so really I rolled a 20.\nSAM: Wait, what? You rolled a three and it becomes a 20?!\nLIAM: For perception, I can no longer roll lower than ten, unless I roll a one. But if it's a two or nine, it's actually a ten for me.\nLAURA: That's awesome.","response":"DM: Rogues are pretty cool."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's crazy.\nLAURA: Yep, rogues are awesome.\nTRAVIS: Rogues are whatever.","response":"DM: So you put your ear up to it and listen carefully. And you hear pacing footsteps creaking against wood no more than maybe four feet away from you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is that one person?","response":"DM: One person stops and then moves again, then moves again almost like there's pacing, and you hear low voices. It's a conversation; there's two voices. You hear one voice very muffled, but it seems to be similar to the voice of the gentleman that came across you guys on the street that actually briefly talked to Percy the day before."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The old guy; the balding guy?","response":"DM: The balding guy with the long stringy gray hair."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He's just reporting in. He's his frigging money collector.","response":"DM: The other voice you don't recognize, and it's too muffled for you to make out anything. About four feet from you, not over the cellar, but off a ways to it. You're not certain where this doorway leads to, the level of muffling you can hear through the floor leads you to believe that they're not directly above you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They might be close.\nTRAVIS: Just to be clear–\nLIAM: No, they're on another floor or in another room.\nTRAVIS: Before we start: we're killing everything, right?\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nTRAVIS: Okay, good. Do we want to send one person out sneaky and then have a code word like Cheeto if it all goes wrong?\nMARISHA: Last time we did that, it went really well.\nTRAVIS: Did we do that before?\nLIAM: No, we didn't send anyone, I just–\nTALIESIN: Let's just go one room at a time.\nSAM: One room at a time? We have to get up through this latch and there's people right above us!\nLIAM: Scanlan, you or me? You want to go invisible, or do you want me to creep in?\nSAM: I think you should have some fun, too. But before we do anything, do you want me to send a cloud up there of gross smoke to smoke out the area?\nLIAM and TALIESIN: No.\nTALIESIN: Let's not let them know we're here.\nLAURA: Wait, before we do this. Keyleth, can you maybe make the gate outside not look like it's all bent to shit?\nLIAM: Zombie guards aren't going to– giants are stupid.\nSAM: It'll be fine.\nLIAM: They're stupid. I mean, there are the guys out front.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: It's fine!\nSAM: What could go wrong? This is a stealth mission. We'll be in and out of here in six minutes if we do this right. Let's go! Go, go!\nMARISHA: Wait, are you going in? Are you infiltrating?\nLIAM: I'll go up and see what I see. Just above us, not far away.\nMARISHA: I touch Vax's shoulder and I cast Enhance Ability and I'm going to give you dex saves– what do you want?\nLIAM: I'm good on that.\nMARISHA: What do you want advantage on?\nLIAM: Not dexterity. Constitution. I'm feeling a little weak.","response":"DM: What's this for?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Enhance Ability. So I think it's called Bear's Constitution or something weird.","response":"DM: Advantage on constitution checks. Those are different from saving throws."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.\nMARISHA: Checks.","response":"DM: But it does give him 2d6 temporary hit points, but those do not stack with the current temporary hit points you have. Constitution would not be of much benefit to you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We could just set a fire down here.\nMARISHA: Okay. Do you want dex or anything?\nLIAM: I'm pretty dex-y already.\nMARISHA: Instead, I say, good luck.\nSAM: Bonne chance! Vive la résistance!\nLIAM: I'm going to check and see if it gives at all or if there's anything to it.","response":"DM: (creak) It gives."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Invisible or not?\nLAURA: Wait, no. Plus ten because Pass Without a Trace.\nLIAM: Oh, 33.\nLIAM: I am listening intently and feeling through as many pockets as I can find around me.","response":"DM: Easily enough. As you put your ear to the door, they are talking immediately on the other side of this door. You are a room adjacent to it. You do manage to pocket from a few of the coats about 47 gold pieces in total."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Who leaves that much in their coat pockets?\nTRAVIS: Dead people, that's who.\nLIAM: Can I make anything out through there?","response":"DM: You make out conversation. It seems to be between a voice you don't recognize and the gentleman earlier you met, basically saying, “With everything that's going on now, it's honestly very frustrating that these people wouldn't do their share of the bargain. I, myself, I've been doing my best to keep them in order, but at this point in time, I think we need to do another show of strength in order to keep them working as hard as we have been.” Another voice calms him down and says, “Don't worry, don't worry. Keep it under control. At the very least, we should have to be ready, prepared. If what Lady Briarwood says, we should be having visitors any day now. And I would hate to be caught flat-footed. So, we're going to go ahead and gather our arms, going to make sure that we outfit the place the best we can. Traps, alarms, whatever is necessary to make sure that we are not caught off-guard.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: This is about to be hilarious!","response":"DM: You guys came at just about the right time."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'd like to– everybody hold.\nSAM: Hold?\nLAURA: Hold.\nLIAM: I just want to wait for one minute and see what progresses.","response":"DM: Okay. The conversation continues. The older gentleman begins talking about, “I don't like the idea of there being any sort of conflict on our home turf. I wish they would just meet them out, head them off, cut them off at the head. Why did we invite them in here? That seems to be a dangerous circumstance.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: While they're talking I say: we've got two gentlemen up here.\nSAM: Two gentlemen!\nLAURA: Okay. I start climbing the–\nLIAM: I think it's time to start killing.\nSAM: Grog up first!\nMARISHA: Places everyone, places!\nLAURA: Grog up before me.\nTRAVIS: It's opening night and I'm so excited!","response":"DM: Stealth checks all around."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Plus ten!\nLIAM: Send up the goliath.\nMARISHA: That's good!\nTRAVIS: 29!\nSAM: 18.\nLAURA: Plus ten!\nSAM: That was plus ten.\nMARISHA: 32.\nTALIESIN: 28.\nLAURA: 34.\nLAURA: Grog first.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, we're opening the door?","response":"DM: You guys are opening a door to a room next to– the wall you were listening to is the room next to you. This opens up into a room adjacent."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Dart my eyes around. Is there anything that's useful in here?","response":"DM: Not particularly; it's mostly decorative. Few vases, some books on the shelf. There is a door that is partially open that leads into hallway. A hallway that seems to connect the two rooms."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Which way are the voices coming from?","response":"DM: Yeah. The door is the opposite of the window and the room that you're in is adjacent to the room that the voices are coming from. The closet is in between the two."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, between the two. So it is out, door, hallway?","response":"DM: Yes, out, door, hallway, and then the room where the speaking is coming from."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do you want me to create a diversion of some sort? No?\nLAURA: Just run in, surprise him.\nSAM: Are we going to go around?\nLIAM: So, we're stealthing, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I pull both of their hands and I say–\nSAM: Who's they?\nTALIESIN: Matt, that's a lot of maps you have down there.\nLAURA: Really? Really?! I'm offended. And I'm hurt.\nMARISHA: I look back at Vex and I just go–\nLAURA: I give you the worst evil eye I've ever given anyone.\nLIAM: Too bad one's going that way and the other's going that way.\nSAM: Oh! Can I? Trinket: stay.\nLAURA: I smack the back of your head again. And it's hard because I'm angry right now.\nTRAVIS: Do you have any of your rings on? Turn them inside and (impact noise).\nMARISHA: It's the mom slap, exactly! It's the grandma backhand.\nLAURA: Yeah, I want to stealth in behind Grog after they go into the room.\nMARISHA: Oh my god. Someone say something cool!","response":"DM: What's the plan?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I put my hand up in the air.\nSAM: de Rolos, roll out!\nLIAM: And I click my boots together. (click) Feel that adrenaline rush.\nTRAVIS: I rage.\nLIAM: And I kick the door as hard as I can and go right in!","response":"DM: (impact noise) The door swings open, both of them slamming into the sides of these two bookcases. Immediately, you see behind the desk here and standing in the center."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's Kiefer Sutherland.","response":"DM: You see the older gentleman in these long robes immediately spin his head and see, essentially, a troupe of armed villagers, peasants, dirty faces come rushing in, all fucked up eyes and all. Rushing into the room. They both turn, looking completely caught off-guard by this. You do also see in the room, there are a few guards that are just waiting off to the side. There's a couch area, there's a fireplace."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Of course. Damn guards.","response":"DM: You guys get a surprise round."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's right!","response":"DM: So, let's go ahead and roll initiative to get the order of things here."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Advantage on initiative because I have that thing.\nSAM: Are you alert? Do you have Alert? Is that what it is?\nTRAVIS: I have Feral Instinct.\nSAM: Ooh!\nTRAVIS: Which I forget sometimes. That's better.\nTRAVIS: 20!\nTALIESIN: 23.\nSAM: 16!\nLAURA: Whoa! Look at you, Scanlan!\nSAM: Better figure out what I'm going to do!","response":"DM: So, Scanlan is 16. 15 to ten?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 13.\nLAURA: 13.\nMARISHA: 13.\nLIAM: Half-elves!","response":"DM: Ten to five? Is that everyone?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's all of us.","response":"DM: That's everyone, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Bitches gonna die!\nMARISHA: Percy!\nTALIESIN: I'm going to pull into that empty– Oh, I've got a button, don't I? I'm going to pull into that corner right there?","response":"DM: Over here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And I'm going to take two shots at that soldier in the corner, that guard.","response":"DM: Okay. The guards, you can see, are wearing dark studded leather armor, no cloaks. Both have rapiers or stilettos, daggers on their sides. They look at the sudden intrusion and begin going for their weapons. You caught them off guard."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 22.","response":"DM: 22 does hit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's just a d10, where are my d10s? That's nine points of damage.\nTALIESIN: Another shot to him.\nTALIESIN: That's a misfire. I'm going to do a quick repair. And that's fine.","response":"DM: Does the repair take an action?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, it takes a–","response":"DM: Okay, so you're fine. It does not break. Cool. That's your turn. One shot off. The blast rings out. As you fire the pepperbox, it misfires, and you quickly throw one of your tools in the air, catch it, and with one swift movement you unblock the passageway, click it back up into its place. Out of the corner of your eye, you turn, and for the first time in five years, you see, standing behind the desk, Sir Kerrion Stonefell. Visually, nearly the same as the last day you saw, except maybe a bit of white on the sides of the hair. Armored with a nice set of relatively ornate leather armor, blue hues and blacks. The hair itself is this tousled brown. There's a boyish charisma to him, if he wasn't such an asshole. And the moment you see him, there's this boiling rage from within just to have that moment of sight."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: If you're lucky, you die last.","response":"DM: There's a look of complete confusion, as he has no idea who any of you are. You look like paupers that literally burst into his office. That ends your turn, Percy. Grog, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I hear him say that he has to die last, and in my rage, I race forward to that fuck in the middle of the room and I swing my Firebrand Warhammer at him twice!\nTRAVIS: I would make to make this first one a new feat called Great Weapon Master.\nSAM: What does that do?","response":"DM: Minus five to hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm going to use my– no, not on that one. That misses.","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A two! So that's 11. Yeah, that misses.","response":"DM: That definitely misses. As you swing in, (nervous yell) just ducks out of the way, and even though he's older, he reacted pretty quickly. Your weapon slams into the ground, splintering some of the wood. You peel back for a second attack."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That makes me even angrier. And now I'll use inspiration. 18… minus five, 23!","response":"DM: 23 does hit! Plus ten damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay. Plus eight is 13, 17, 27!","response":"DM: 27 points of damage, ooh!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Plus four for the fire damage, but still the 27 total.","response":"DM: So, as he ducks out of the way, you bring up the hammer a second time and (whack) smack him right square in the chest. (grunts) The wind escapes him for a moment and the flames lick across the front of his chest. He catches himself on the table between the sofa and chair behind him. Gets back on his feet. Looks to you for a second and pulls out two short swords."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's the best thing you could have ever done.","response":"DM: “I don't know who you are, but you're going to regret this!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What does Grog look like?","response":"DM: Grog looks like an oafish butcher. Tubby on the sides, an oldish, middle-aged looking man. Scruffy beard. Scanlan does his best on that one. Whatever other visual you want to–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Potbelly.","response":"DM: Huge potbelly. Grog, that ends your turn?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yep.\nTRAVIS: (screams) 26. Minus five is 21.\nLAURA: 23. No, you're right.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. 21.","response":"DM: Roll damage again. We'll say this is an additional third strike in reaction to him pulling his blades out."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 32.\nSAM: Jesus! God!","response":"DM: (wham) The hammer slams him a second time and he almost drops his weapons. The actual end table he's resting on shatters beneath him and he, (grunts) has to get back up onto his feet. Looking genuinely fearful now. That ends your turn."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You dropped your toothpicks.","response":"DM: Scanlan, you're up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, so he's been attacking the old guy.","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Those two flanking the big boss are just guards, right? They're just standard-issue guards?","response":"DM: Best you can tell, they're both in studded leather armor. They don't look like guards, like armored, they look like thugs that are essentially there to watch."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Make a left. I'm sorry, turn right, away from the action. And then I'll look at the guard behind and to the right of the big guy.","response":"DM: That guy there."}
{"prompt":"SAM: The good guy– the bad guy.\nMARISHA: You got it.","response":"DM: That guy there?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, this guy over here. And I'll Dominate him.\nMARISHA: Is that also a guard? There are three guards?\nTALIESIN: There are three guards.","response":"DM: What's the DC on that?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 19.","response":"DM: Wisdom. He rolled a 17. That's a fail."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes!","response":"DM: He is currently Dominated by Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Cool.","response":"DM: That ends your turn?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah, that's it.\nLAURA: Can I go first so I don't do any damage to you guys if you guys go in?\nMARISHA: I'm also probably going to do a ranged spell.\nLIAM: What are you guys talking about? Kill him!\nLAURA: I want to go in, peek my head in and shoot– first, I'm going to shoot from my Longbow of Sky Sentinel. And I'm going to use– it turns into three arrows for one of my attacks, so it's three more attacks, potentially?","response":"DM: Well, it's two additional attacks against the one arrow. So you'd get four attacks in one round, essentially."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Good god!\nLAURA: Okay! I'm going to do that! I'm going to attack him, the guy.","response":"DM: Which guy?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The bad guy.","response":"DM: There's two bad guys in there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The one that's in charge. Kerrion.\nLAURA: Yeah! 28.","response":"DM: 28 hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, so I make an attack for all three arrows.","response":"DM: Correct. That was one of them. You fire it, it splits into three along the way, and you roll for each attack on each arrow."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that one doesn't hit. Well, probably not. 13?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 18?","response":"DM: 18 unfortunately does not hit, either."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Jeez Louise, what a waste of a storm arrow.","response":"DM: And you still get a fourth attack with your second–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes.\nTALIESIN: Hunter's Mark?\nLAURA: That was the wrong thing. I can't; I'm going to Hunter's Mark him after this first one because it's a bonus action.\nTALIESIN: Oh, yeah.\nLAURA: What am I doing? 14, 15, 16, and then plus another d6, so it's basically like Hunter's Mark, right?\nTRAVIS: Nobody knows what you're doing.","response":"DM: So the first arrow does an additional lightning damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 19 is the first one. And then I attack again. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him now. Can I do that?","response":"DM: You haven't used your bonus action, so yes you can. Two eyes going all–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 29.","response":"DM: 29 does hit, yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm so confused right now.\nLIAM: Us, too.\nLAURA: I know. 14 on the second one.","response":"DM: Okay, gotcha. So your arrows split, two of them embedding into the actual desk itself and exploding with a burst of electricity. A third one strikes him in the chest and you can see it stick in the armor and (boof) jolt him for a second. He backs up a little bit, catching himself on the edge of the desk as the final arrow comes and strikes him in the shoulder. He cuts off the shaft of the arrow as it hits (grunts) out of anger and frustration."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I totally shit the bed on that one, guys, and I apologize. I had things I wanted to do.\nSAM: After she does that, I say: that was my grandma!\nLAURA: That's right, boy!","response":"DM: This little boy."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Adding to the confusion.","response":"DM: Do you want to move at all? You would've had to move into the room to do that shot because you were outside in the hallway."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Huh?","response":"DM: You were in the hallway when that happened, so I'd say you'd have to be in the room to shoot them. Where would you want to be?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, just right inside the door.","response":"DM: Right there in the door?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What kind of armor is Sir Kerrion wearing?","response":"DM: Best you can tell, it looks like a very high quality studded leather."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Studded leather?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nLAURA: Can I say I peeked in to shoot and then went back around the side of the door?","response":"DM: Yeah, you can do that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Keyleth, Vax.\nLIAM: Is it up to us?","response":"DM: You guys are the last ones to go."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Go.\nMARISHA: Okay, I'm going to cast Call Lightning. And I'm going to bring down a bolt. Here we go. This way. Right in between Sir Kerrion and this guard so they both have to save from it.\nSAM: Take that, Sir Korea!\nMARISHA: Yeah!\nTALIESIN: Kerrion Stonefell.","response":"DM: As a thing of note, a storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is ten feet tall with a 60-foot radius centered on a point you can see in the air."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, so it's going to–","response":"DM: The room won't fit it, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The room won't fit my storm cloud?\nTALIESIN: That sounds like a great song.","response":"DM: It says if you're in a room that can't accommodate the cloud, it can't appear."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Pooper muffin. Okay. Well, then.","response":"DM: If you want to consider your next move, Vax can go."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, go Vax.\nLIAM: I am running straight towards what's-his-name, Kerrion? Is at the desk, so I just run right towards the desk, I step against the desk, leap up in the air and go (stabbing sound) into his shoulders.","response":"DM: Right there?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, no, I'm on the desk in front of him, going for his chest.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: First, and I get advantage on everything is a– It's a 30! And this is surprise attack, so it's a critical hit plus the sneak attack damage. This guy is going down! One plus seven is eight– what gets doubled?","response":"DM: Just the dice."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just the dice? But not the sneak attack damage?","response":"DM: No, the sneak attack damage, as well, but just the modifiers don't get doubled."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. So that was– okay, two plus seven is nine. Nine, ten, 11, 12, 18, 23, 29, 33, 66 for the first attack, darling.\nSAM: 66?!\nLIAM: 66! Here comes the second dagger into him at advantage.\nMARISHA: 66?!","response":"DM: Surprise rounds."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is 28, so that obviously hits. And that is seven. And then the third dagger comes down. Is 29, and that also hits. So I've shanked his ass, that's an eight. (stabbing noises)\nSAM: That's 15, is 70– is 81.","response":"DM: Yep. 81 points of damage in one round of combat. As you land on the desk, your daggers bypass the armor and they find their way through the top of the armor and sink past the clavicles into the deep portion of the chest. He (choking noise) from the impact and you hear him choke and blood splatters up from his throat. He reaches up and grabs your hands and lifts them off out of the wound. You see a gout of blood pour from the wound as you reach back and stab him a third time with the dagger as you catch yourself on the desk. He reaches up and kicks you, forcing you to get back on your feet with your daggers at the ready. The blood's beginning to pour. It's not a mortal wound, but it's looking really bad for him. He's not on death's door, but that definitely took him down a few pegs."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I give him a Vex wink.\nTRAVIS: Two rapiers?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He draws two rapiers? Do we get any indication by what we just saw if he might be a vampire or something?","response":"DM: Make an insight check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can make an insight check? Ooh, yeah! 27.","response":"DM: 27. Nothing yet has given away any sort of essence of that. He doesn't look particularly pale."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: He's also aged. He's a bit peppered.\nMARISHA: Yeah, he has aged.","response":"DM: He definitely looks wounded and unhappy."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Can I ask a technical question?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: According to Assassinate, any hit I score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit. Any hit. So are the two subsequent attacks–","response":"DM: After the first hit–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's sneak attack. This says, “in addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.”","response":"DM: Right. Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Any? He wouldn't be surprised after the first one.","response":"DM: I'm usually under the impression that after the first hit, they're no longer surprised. They know you're there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. Okay. Got it.\nTRAVIS: (grunts) Ow! (grunts) Ow?!\nLIAM: Well, I thought they were like 0.3 seconds apart, so I thought it was so fast.","response":"DM: That's true. I'll allow it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh!\nTALIESIN: What?!\nTRAVIS: Double what?\nLIAM: Double the last two attacks. Which were much less.\nSAM: It was 15, so it becomes 30.\nTALIESIN: That's like a normal wolf.\nMARISHA: But slightly bigger.\nTALIESIN: But dire.\nMARISHA: But dire. It's white, a wintery wolf from the mountains that I'm from.","response":"DM: You are now filling up the entirety of the double-door frame right now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to rush and use my pack tactics and flank Lord Kerrion.","response":"DM: At your size, you can't quite get to him, unfortunately. You can try and move around this way, maybe. You will probably take an attack of opportunity from this guy, but you can try and move around."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, from a random shithead? Yeah, let's do it.","response":"DM: What's your movement?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 50 feet.","response":"DM: Yeah, you can do that. You move around and you get over there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is that flanking?","response":"DM: It's not flanking, no. Yeah, it's not flanking per se. I mean, you're adjacent to him. You'd have to be on opposite sides to flank."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nSAM: That is the most peasant-looking direwolf ever.","response":"DM: Yeah, this little peasant girl just went (growls)."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ooh, that was a 19 to hit.","response":"DM: That'll hit."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, 2d6 plus three. That's not great, four, five, six, seven, eight piercing damage, and then do I also– oh, and he has to make a DC 13 strength saving throw or be knocked prone.","response":"DM: He rolled a 12."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Not a lot. What did I say, six?","response":"DM: Six points of piercing damage?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes.","response":"DM: He's knocked prone. (impact sound) Falls on the ground."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do I get my fiery stuff for that?","response":"DM: What attack was it? Was it bite?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Bite.","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Okay, he's down.\nMARISHA: Yep.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to take one step forward. I'm going to shoot that guard once, one more time.","response":"DM: The one over here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yep.\nTALIESIN: Fuck it, I'm going to try sharpshooter. And that's 14, 15, 21 to hit?","response":"DM: 21 hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That'll do 19 points of damage. Actually, that's more than 19 points, because it's a fire shot, so 19 plus two, so 21 points, with two points of fire damage in there.\nTALIESIN: I'm shooting him again.\nTALIESIN: That's 17.","response":"DM: 17 hits."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Nice.\nTALIESIN: That's 21 points of damage.","response":"DM: 21 points of damage, nice. (gunshot) You blast him, this time on the other side of the shoulder, you can see now this armor is now torn open exposing the wound here and his arm's now hanging to one side. He's (grunts). He's looking in severe pain and barely hanging on at this point."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Fall, damn it. Shooting him again.\nMARISHA: Kill him!\nTALIESIN: That's 20 to hit.","response":"DM: 20 to hit. It hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Eight points of damage.\nTALIESIN: I finish walking almost into the corner over there, right next to him, about there. Spend an action surge, taking three more shots at Kerrion.\nSAM: Whoa.\nMARISHA: Yeah!\nSAM: Damn.\nTALIESIN: This is a sharpshooter round.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 19, 26 to hit.","response":"DM: 26 hits."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do you crit on a 19?\nTALIESIN: I don't crit on a 19.\nMARISHA: Fuck!\nTALIESIN: Oh, that'll do. 24 points of damage plus a point of ice damage. So, 25 points of damage.","response":"DM: Plus an additional d6 points of damage for that."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yay! Because he's an asshole. That's six more points of damage.","response":"DM: So, as you go around and fire from the barrel, the shot fires out. And as you recoil you guys, for those who are noticing off to the side, this dark smoke's beginning to slowly pour out of Percy's body, out of his eyes and his ears and the hand on the gun. There's black smoke beginning to emit from his body and beginning to envelop the gun arm."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What?\nMARISHA: We all see this?","response":"DM: For those who are paying attention, which right now would be pretty much just Scanlan and Vex."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You're weird.\nTALIESIN: So you don't see shit. Shut up.\nMARISHA: I'm not crazy! No, and I'm at this guy's throat.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to take a quick reload, and I'm going to fire again, with Sharpshooter, and I'm going to do a head shot.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So, I'm going to attempt to make him have issues doing things. Natural 20.\nTRAVIS: The golden snitch strikes again!\nMARISHA: Yeah, it did! I can see it from here!","response":"DM: Damn!"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I swear it's– yeah.","response":"DM: With the additional d6, by the way."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What?","response":"DM: With the additional d6."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Does the d6 double or does it not double?","response":"DM: All dice rolled double. Then add the modifier."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This is going to be angry.\nMARISHA: Yeah it is!\nLIAM: Gunslinger warlock.\nTALIESIN: So.\nMARISHA: That's pretty “grood.”\nTALIESIN: 42 points of damage. Of fire damage. 42 points, and that's with five points of fire damage. 42 points.","response":"DM: Okay. (gunshot) The first blast hits and you can see the cloak is blown off the shoulder and set aflame and actually burns to cinders in the corner. Sir Kerrion looks down and is like (grunts), and is looking very, very curiously. The second shot rings out (gunshot), and at this point now the smoke is wreathing your entire arm, the gun isn't even visible, it's just this giant column of smoke. (gunshot) The second shot rings out, this time hitting him in the side of the neck and the shoulder, blowing a chunk off of it so part of the bone is now sticking out it's like (noise of pain). He reaches back with his arm and is like with the rapier up, clutching it for a second and leans over and looks back over and is (pained panting) “Ripley.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Just as an action, as a bonus action, I'm going to remove my hat, and I'm just going to say: Drop it.\nSAM: Will this take an action?","response":"DM: To drop the spell? You can do it on your turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: On your turn, yeah.\nSAM: Okay. I think that's next.\nMARISHA: He thinks it's Ripley. He thinks it's Ripley with the gun! Ripley's building guns!\nLAURA: It's Ripley that's doing the guns!\nMARISHA: Fucking Ripley!","response":"DM: So. That finishes Percy's turn. It is now Sir Kerrion Stonefell's turn. Kerrion's going to use a bonus action to use Second Wind."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh no, that's some sort of healing thing isn't it?\nTALIESIN: That's healing. It's not much healing.\nMARISHA: Wait, who's doing what?\nSAM: He has 6,000 health points.\nMARISHA: Kerrion's healing? Is it a regeneration thing or is he casting a spell?\nTALIESIN: No, it's a fighter action.","response":"DM: And that was with the head shot, you said?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, it was with a head shot. So that means he has disadvantage on attacks for one round.","response":"DM: And deals damage, right?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And deals damage.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm a good boy.","response":"DM: Sir Kerrion is going to, in the circumstance, is going to move this way just to hide alongside Vax, and since you're on top– his both rapiers out, and you just jammed your daggers in, is going to do a flurry of four strikes against you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: With disadvantage on all the attacks."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: His clavicles sticking out of his shoulders.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll use Uncanny Dodge for the first one that hits.","response":"DM: 16, the first attack?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No.\nTRAVIS: Get that clavicle; be working.\nLIAM: Yeah, Uncanny Dodge on that attack.","response":"DM: That is eight points of piercing damage against you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So, four.\nSAM: Ooh! That's nothing!\nLIAM: That's nothing.","response":"DM: That finishes Sir Kerrion. Sir Kerrion is now going to–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Turn invisible.","response":"DM: He's actually going to take a step back towards the wall. You get an attack of opportunity."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is a 28.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is eight points of damage.\nLAURA: Oh no!\nSAM: Wait, who did that?\nLAURA and TRAVIS: Kerrion.\nLAURA: He's calling in backup.\nMARISHA: Wait, he's calling in backup? Shit.\nLIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: So, that ends Kerrion's turn. Grog, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I keep smashing shithead that's in front of me!","response":"DM: Okay, go for it!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's 24. These are just regular.","response":"DM: Yeah, 24 hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, I should roll the other one first. Again, 24.","response":"DM: 24 hits. Are you going into a frenzied rage?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Regular rage. 23 on the first one.\nTRAVIS: And 12 on the second.","response":"DM: Gotcha. (whack) Is this with the fire damage as well from the hammer?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes.\nTRAVIS: That's it.","response":"DM: It is now Master Vouk's turn."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Who?","response":"DM: You have not heard his name yet, but it's his turn."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The guy I've been smacking.\nTALIESIN: Mr. Rogaine.\nLAURA: I'm picturing him as what's-his-name in–\nTALIESIN: From Harry Potter.\nLAURA: Yeah!\nTALIESIN: Yeah. I know, me too.\nTRAVIS: Mr. Filch?\nTALIESIN: Filch. Filch on steroids.\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: He's going to use a– okay. He's going to use a bonus action to disengage from you. He's going to back away just one step that way. Use his action to–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He has magic?!\nMARISHA: Oh, he's going to Dimension Door out.\nLAURA: But Mr. Filch doesn't have magic.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, he's a squib!\nLAURA: He's a squib! Squibs can't do magic.\nTRAVIS: He knows this. He's making origami.\nTALIESIN: Don't you get an attack of opportunity?","response":"DM: Actually, instead, he's not going to use bonus action to disengage, he's going to use a bonus action to use Misty Step. Vanishes, reappears over by the wall. Uses the action to cast a level three Invisibility on both him and Sir Kerrion Stonefell. So they are both considered invisible at the moment."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: With the Missy Elliot step, I don't get an attack?","response":"DM: Not from that, unfortunately; it's an immediate teleport. So he just vanishes from in front of you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What the fuck?!","response":"DM: We'll say, for the purposes of this, they are both currently invisible. And that's going to end–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That soldier hasn't attacked yet, either.","response":"DM: Correct, his turn hasn't come up yet. Now it becomes Scanlan's turn."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh. Well, I can't see anyone who's alive who I haven't Dominated already, except for the guy under the dire wolf. I will remind all my fellows to keep one alive to spread our terrorist message and I will run out to the hallway and say, Vex, get inside. Because I know reinforcements are coming, I cast Stinking Cloud out into the hallways.","response":"DM: Okay. Stinking Cloud appears. What's the radius on that?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It says 90-feet range, let's see here. 20-foot radius.","response":"DM: Okay, cool. So you just filled this entire hallway."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah. Will it seep into the room as well?","response":"DM: You can keep it localized to that area, you'll just be in your own cloud."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh. Well, can I stop just short of the door?","response":"DM: You stop just short of the door and fill this whole area with a Stinking Cloud."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Sorry, Vex.\nTALIESIN: You can hold that action until she comes into the room.\nSAM: Okay, I will hold that until she comes in the room.","response":"DM: Okay. So Stinking Cloud is not yet up. Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Laura's next, I believe.","response":"DM: So, next round. You are up next."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And I will inspire her, as well.\nLAURA: Yay!\nSAM: Do you want a d10?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Amazing! How?! God! I don't get it!","response":"DM: You take your d10 inspiration. Confused, but accept the inspiration. A chuckle in the middle of a hearty battle is always worth a little inspiration."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, I stay in the doorway. Actually no, I back– well.","response":"DM: What are you doing, Vex?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, I'm staying right there. I can't see; is there a soldier right there next to the invisible guys, or is it just the invisible guys?\nTRAVIS: On that wall, it's soldier being eaten by Keyleth, and then invisible.\nSAM: There two invisibles, and then another soldier who I have already Dominated. He still hasn't had a turn?!","response":"DM: Surprise round, and they're lowest on the initiative count."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Actually, I'm going to do Lightning Arrow because that gets everything within ten feet.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on the soldier on the ground.","response":"DM: Which one?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The one that Keyleth's attacking.\nLAURA: The one that Keyleth's attacking.","response":"DM: I will say you don't really have visual on him from that position."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I move to a place where I get it?\nLIAM: Do a bank shot off the ceiling.","response":"DM: Now you can see, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Awesome. Let's do it from there.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it. You have advantage on the attack roll because he is prone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice. 27.","response":"DM: 27 hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, so that is 4d8 damage to him.\nLAURA: And then anything within ten feet has to make a dex save.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is that including your brother?\nLAURA: Yeah, that's everything within ten feet.\nTRAVIS: It's also including invisible guys.","response":"DM: If it's ten feet, he's not there. It'd just be Keyleth and Sir Kerrion."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 22. 21!","response":"DM: Makes it, 21, actually, exactly."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 19 to little prone soldier.","response":"DM: Okay, 19. As it snaps and it bursts, the electricity shockwaves out, he shakes and on the ground takes in the effect. The blast seems to– is it half damage if they make the save?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: To the little prone guy?","response":"DM: No, it's to anybody within radius."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Anybody within radius takes 1d8 if they make the save and then 2d8 if they fail.","response":"DM: Okay, so roll 1d8."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: One.","response":"DM: Okay. So one damage to you, and one damage to Sir Kerrion."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.","response":"DM: You see a spark of energy around the invisible form as it wavers in place."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's good; at least he (electricity noise) around some.\nLIAM: I saw that spark in the air and I start knifing right into it.\nLAURA: Yeah. Does the Hunter's Mark damage him, the invisible guy, still, if he gets hit with anything? Or is it just if I attack him with an arrow?","response":"DM: I think if you attack him. That was more of the burst in the vicinity."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nLIAM: So, hearing him go (grunts) and seeing a spark right in front of me, I start knifing at that point.\nLIAM: Disadvantage? But I get advantage, so it cancels out.","response":"DM: Why do you get advantage?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, no, I don't. I'm sorry.","response":"DM: Disadvantage on weapon strikes because he's invisible."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The first one misses. That was it. So, the first two were terrible. That's terrible. That's also terrible. I whiff. I just (whooshing).\nLIAM: Still bleeding!","response":"DM: Unless you want to stay where you are right there?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to stay there.","response":"DM: You probably would've had to move up there to attack him. Oh, you're just throwing the daggers, right?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I back up. Is Keyleth on the desk?\nSAM: No, she's next to the desk.\nLIAM: And I'm on the desk? No, I'll stay where I am.","response":"DM: Okay, so you're just throwing the daggers from the desk? Okay, that ends your turn. Now, Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Looking up and noticing that Sir Kerrion is gone and Vax is blindly stabbing into the distance, I'm going to drop my wolf form and cast Faerie Fire in that radius.","response":"DM: Drop your wolf form."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 20-foot cube.\nSAM: Mark that shit.\nMARISHA: Right here.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Realizing my party members are clearly stabbing at something.\nTALIESIN: I like it when he has to go to the book. Makes me feel like there's, perhaps, things he doesn't know.\nSAM: Faerie Fire is an underused thing. It's really cool.","response":"DM: Yeah, so both of their forms all of a sudden are outlined by this sparking purple halo that shows you directly where they are."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes!\nMARISHA: I'll back up a tidbit.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just back up a smidge.","response":"DM: Okay, as you back up an invisible form that just got revealed swings out at you with a rapier, an attack of opportunity."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, sure, whatever.\nTALIESIN: But, he's–","response":"DM: At disadvantage on the attack. He has advantage on her because he's– although–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can see him now.","response":"DM: You can see him, that's true."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is confusing!","response":"DM: Faerie Fire kind of made this weird."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: To the books again!","response":"DM: Indeed."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Faerie Fire always makes it weird.\nTALIESIN: Ain't it the truth? Man, that Faerie Fire.","response":"DM: Just a minute, folks. Lot of overlapping effects, here, because everyone has magic."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Now's a good time to go to the store and check out Critical Role t-shirt–","response":"DM: Yeah, it doesn't benefit from Invisible. It's at disadvantage. It has disadvantage on the attack. That is–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Brand new t-shirt for sale, guys.","response":"DM: And 15."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Miss.\nSAM: On me?!","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Jesus.","response":"DM: That's going to be a 16 to hit?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't even know any more. No one's attacked me in a while.\nTALIESIN: It's your AC.\nSAM: It's 17.","response":"DM: 17!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, it's 15 plus two because I've got some thing on.\nMARISHA: You've got the amulet on.\nTRAVIS: I thought he was coming for me.\nSAM: I thought so, too. That would have been good!","response":"DM: This guy is going to attempt to make two attacks against Master Vouk Strono. Has advantage on them because Faerie Fire. That hits. And, two attacks with a mace. That is 18. Yeah, hits with both. (whack whack) With the mace both times."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is that the guy who you charmed? Awesome.\nTALIESIN: Nice.\nSAM: Wait. Who's this?\nLIAM: The guy you charmed.\nSAM: That's not my guy, Matt.","response":"DM: That guy?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, that guy there is, yeah. Oh wait, he's attacking my guy?","response":"DM: No, he's attacking the guy that's invisible."}
{"prompt":"SAM: On my spell?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's 19.","response":"DM: 19. Yeah, he does not make it. Still under control. That ends the thugs' turn. Top of the round. Percy, you're up!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Go Percy, go Percy, go!\nTALIESIN: Sharpshooter against Kerrion.","response":"DM: Sir Kerrion, okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do I have advantage on that because of Faerie Fire?","response":"DM: It does not benefit from invisibility and you have advantage. Yes, you do. Vox Machina: broken."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 16.","response":"DM: 16 to hit?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: Misses."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Taking another shot.\nMARISHA: That was with advantage?\nTALIESIN: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Pooper.\nTALIESIN: 20.","response":"DM: 20 does hit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 15 points of damage.","response":"DM: 15. (gunshot) You see one blast hits the wall and causes part of the wood to splinter outward. The second shot impacts the partially invisible form. You can see a splash of blood across the desk in front. Partially spattering across Vax and one of his guards."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Third shot with ice. No sharpshooter. Natural 20!\nTRAVIS: What?!\nMARISHA: Percy rolls!\nTRAVIS: What the hell?!\nTALIESIN: It's making up for my gun failing four times.\nTRAVIS: Whatever, you possessed Voldemort.\nTALIESIN: I know.\nTALIESIN: Six, 16, 25, 31 points of damage. 31 points of damage with four points of that being ice damage.","response":"DM: So, Percy: how do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He said that weird.\nMARISHA: This against Kerrion, right?","response":"DM: This is against Sir Kerrion."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wow! How do you want to do this? That's the logo that's on the shirt that's for sale right now.\nTALIESIN: Oh, stop it.\nTRAVIS: Is this the name on one of the barrels?","response":"DM: Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Don't cheapen this!\nSAM: Too late.","response":"DM: Currently visible, at your disposal, Sir Kerrion. You have enough of a shot to finish him off. The smoke is pushing you, “Vengeance. Vengeance. Vengeance.” Repeatedly echoing in the back of your mind. How do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to put on the mask, since he still doesn't know who I am.","response":"DM: Okay. You pull the mask down, the bird-beaked element to the mask now wreathed in smoke, resembling, very closely, the entity that made the original bargain with you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up to him. Yeah, there's no way to drop the illusion. That's such a damn shame.\nSAM: Oh wait, you told me to!\nTALIESIN: I did.\nMARISHA: Could you do it now, for flavor?\nTALIESIN: That's fine. The mask will do. I'm going to take one last shot. I'm going to look right at him, I'm going to catch his eye. This is for the de Rolos. And let me say: you were the one I was least looking forward to.\nTRAVIS: That's some cold shit!","response":"DM: With that, the little bit of wreathed magical energy you can barely make out an expression of horror on the face before the resounding blast sound rocks the room. The actual bullet itself a trail of black smoke behind it as it impacts the front of Sir Kerrion's face. The entirety of his head caving inward as the back splatters across the scarred wooden wall behind him. The body slumps to the ground immediately. You guys all glance over at Percy. You don't even see Percy, you just see a humanoid entity made of black swirling smoke energy with the peaked beak of his mask poking through."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Not 100% sure what's going on. Can I take my Faerie Fire concentration that I still have up and move it over top of the black smoke figure?","response":"DM: Can you move a Faerie Fire?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't know; can I move a Faerie Fire?","response":"DM: I think when you use it, it just stays where it was. Could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's how it works."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 20 feet; is he in it, perchance?","response":"DM: From there, it's 20 foot, no. Not from where you placed it right on him, unfortunately. That's okay. Yeah, no, it just happens once."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Never mind.","response":"DM: With that, you recoil from it and the voice echoes in the back of your head, going “Yes.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to drop the gun.","response":"DM: You drop it (impact sound)."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Remove my mask. Run to find something metal, something sharp, anywhere on the table. And just start scratching off the name on the gun. I'm just going to go to a corner and just start scratching the name off.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: He's disturbed.","response":"DM: Okay, that's your turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's my turn.","response":"DM: Sir Kerrion is gone. Annihilated. That brings us to Grog."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Percy's having all the fun. And I start smashing that fuck that's looking at Vax.","response":"DM: Right there, okay. So you move up to him, (whoosh) swinging the hammer wide."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Might as well make these great weapon master strikes, just for fucking why not. That's a 15.","response":"DM: 15 just hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, that's awesome. And the second one– Yeah, that's pretty good. 28 minus five. 23.","response":"DM: 23 hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay. 15. 20 is the first one, with the fire damage. Oh!\nLAURA: Actually that's 30.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, 30 is the first one. Plus 10. And 13, 16, 26 for the second one.","response":"DM: Okay. So as you rush up, you can see, it's pulled out its mace and is swinging it in a wide arc towards Vax. As soon as you rush up, it looks to you out of the corner of the eye, drops the mace and before the mace can hit the ground, your hammer actually swings around, hits the mace, and then both your hammer and the mace slam into the side of his head, pushing him down onto the desk. Stunned, blood spatters across the wood as he's (gasping) twitching on the table, already done. And you swing the hammer, lift it up, (impact sound), like Gallagher performance, the head just (explosion noise)."}
{"prompt":"(groaning)\nLAURA: This is disgusting.\nLIAM: Happy Halloween, folks.\nTRAVIS: Great weapon master.","response":"DM: Vouk is currently looking very–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: He's Vouk-ed.\nLAURA: Doesn't the guard get a–","response":"DM: The guard gets an attack of opportunity, and Keyleth does. The guard has advantage. A three. No, the guard misses, with a mace."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Natural 20.\nLAURA: Yeah! With your fire hands?\nMARISHA: No, it's with my staff, I'm assuming, right? Unless I wanted to deck him in the face.","response":"DM: No, this would be with your staff."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: This is with my staff, okay.","response":"DM: You just (whack)."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So it's five, so that's 11. I don't attack a lot. 13 damage.","response":"DM: 13 damage?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: I just clothesline him. I see him running, I'm like (grunts).","response":"DM: It brings him exactly to zero."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Good, yes, keep him alive.\nSAM: Scanlan's up?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I mean, can I change it from “kill your boss” to–\nTRAVIS: “Kill yourself.”\nSAM: To “give up”?","response":"DM: Yeah, you can tell him. You can't tell him to attack himself."}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, I will tell him–\nTALIESIN: You– Oh, go ahead.\nSAM: No, what?\nTALIESIN: I was going to say, tell him to go tell anybody else in the house everything's fine.\nSAM: Oh. Ooh! That's good.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, because we should kill the more powerful guy.\nTALIESIN: Tell him that everything's fine.\nSAM: Okay. You there, guard! Go tell everyone that everything's fine. Go into that Stinking Cloud out there and tell all your friends that everything's hunky-dory.","response":"DM: Technically, Stinking Cloud is a concentration spell."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is it?","response":"DM: So if you were to maintain concentration on that, you would lose your Domination."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, okay.","response":"DM: So it's your call. Which one do you want to maintain?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: The domination.","response":"DM: Okay. So the Stinking Cloud fades from the hallway."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Stinking Cloud is concentration?","response":"DM: I believe it is. Spells like that usually are, if it's to maintain–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It is! I never wrote down a C next to it.","response":"DM: This is where that circlet would come in handy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Can I run over to Kerrion's body?","response":"DM: You will be able to shortly."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You mean the thing that Orion took from me? Yeah, the thing that I needed? Yeah.\nSAM: Yes, so I tell him to go warn his friends– not warn his friends. Tell his friends that everything's fine. All is good.","response":"DM: Cool. Good to know. That ends your turn. Is anyone going to take any specific actions?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I want to loot the bodies.\nTALIESIN: I'm running over to Kerrion and just going to rage loot him.\nSAM: I'm going to go to the desk.","response":"DM: Okay. While you guys all do that, the guard leaves the room. You hear a few whispers in the hallway, a conversation with a person unseen."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I walk towards the door.\nTRAVIS: Uh-oh.\nSAM: A giant attacks.","response":"DM: The conversation fades and the guard walks back, seemingly job done. Also is going to make a wisdom saving throw. That is a 17?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 19.","response":"DM: He remains dominated. You guys now– For the moment, the threat seems to have subsided. At the moment. You're still in the house and there's still, apparently, things in the house. Whether it'd be guards or other individuals in the house that are on edge as they heard a series of gunshots ring out, screams, and other sorts of cacophony. The fact that this is even right now being handled is a very lucky series of rolls on his part."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I want it said that this one should die. He has magic. He's too strong. They could set better traps.\nSAM: We can interrogate him, though. Get crucial information. He's an officer.\nTALIESIN: I can't talk yet.","response":"DM: So you're going through Sir Kerrion's body."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm taking his swords, and I'm going to use his sword to get that deep gouge into the gun.","response":"DM: He has two rapiers, so it's like holding a stiletto."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And anything he has on his body, I'm taking it.","response":"DM: He has a potion of greater healing on him. Never got round to actually using it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And once there's a good gash in the name, I'm going to sit down and breathe.","response":"DM: Okay. As you finish gashing the name out on the side of the metal and start breathing, you can see the name itself begin to glow with a slight dull purple glow and burn away from the metal, leaving just the scratch marks. From his body, you have two rapiers, regular rapiers, studded leather armor that is enchanted with a plus one bonus, and that potion of greater healing. So you can mark those down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm keeping a very strong eye on Percy right now.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Anything on the desk, papers of any sort?","response":"DM: Going through the desk? Go ahead and make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's a lot. Yeah, it's tons. It's 27.","response":"DM: Yeah. You find wax seals, you find parchment, you find pocket change, about six or seven gold pieces just left in there. On himself though, on his actual person, on Sir Kerrion's body, you find about 320 gold pieces as his own personal fund. Looking through the desk, you find mentions of the bridge plan to move between the two continents. To go across the channel to Wildemount. Basically plans, the discussion, a lot of what they were planning to do with Emon."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Someone write that down.\nSAM: I got it.","response":"DM: You also find a small notebook that just has some hand notes of his."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'll take it.","response":"DM: Okay. So mark that down."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I start tying up unconscious guy on the floor.","response":"DM: He's currently– He's got to zero hit points, he's bleeding out."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What about the dominated guy? He's about to save from it. Domination, he can save from it at any second.\nTRAVIS: No, I know. I thought we wanted to interrogate–","response":"DM: Which he does not; he's still dominated."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I take a rag out of my pocket and I roll it up and I shove it into Kerrion's mouth while Grog is tying him up.\nTALIESIN: Kerrion's dead.\nLIAM: I thought he was out.\nSAM: Vouk's.\nTRAVIS: The balding guy.\nTRAVIS: We tie him up, he shoves a rag in his mouth, I put one hand on the top of his head and the other hand under his chin. Should we bring him back just a little so we can ask him some questions?\nMARISHA: Vouk?\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Okay, but what are we going to do about dominated guy? Can we tie him up, too?\nLAURA: Yeah, tell him to go sit in a corner, Scanlan.\nMARISHA: He could save from that any second. We need to like off him or something.\nTALIESIN: There'll be time for that.\nLIAM: I got it. Could you tell him to look in the corner?\nSAM: Turn away, look in the corner, Blair Witch style.\nLAURA: Oh, this is so wrong.","response":"DM: Doesn't make his save."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, terrible.\nSAM: Grog, do you want to?\nLAURA: No, this is so wrong.\nTRAVIS: What? We're asking questions. We got to bring him back, just a little bit.\nSAM: Are you on Vouk's right? Or whatever-his-name?\nTRAVIS: We're on Vouk.\nLIAM: Can we put him to sleep, or anything short of me knocking him out?\nSAM: I can put him to sleep.\nLIAM: Put him to sleep, then.\nSAM: But I have to drop my thing first.\nLAURA: Just knock him out.\nLIAM: I'll do it. I'm really good at knocking people out.\nMARISHA: Just knock him out. Knowing what's coming, I'm going to Druidcraft some pretty kaleidoscope-y flowers in front of his face. Pretty image before you die.\nLIAM: Oh, pommel.\nTRAVIS: Before we knock him out, should you make sure that whatever he tells people is truly fearsome? But not too descript about us?\nSAM: Well, he already told his friends in the hallway–\nTRAVIS: That everything was fine.\nSAM: That everything's fine. So now we're just knocking him out.\nMARISHA: While all this happens, I'm going over to baldy. Lord Vouk or Mister Vouk and pop a Cure Wounds potion into him. How far down is he? He was just at zero. I brought him to zero.","response":"DM: Yeah, he was unconscious and he was making his death saving throws. I was treating him for that circumstance. When you go straight to zero like that, you know–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The guy in the corner? Scanlan, could you go stand next to him and tell him a joke?\nMARISHA: I was giving him pretty flowers.\nLIAM: You're standing next to him?\nMARISHA: I gave him pretty flowers to look at.\nLIAM: You walked over and gave him pretty flowers?\nMARISHA: I Druidcrafted from a distance.\nTRAVIS: Are you standing next to him?\nSAM: I walk next to him and sort of distract him with a little soft shoe tap.\nLIAM: Thank you. That's what I needed. I got an 18. Sorry, I got a 29. And that is eight plus 14, 22, six, seven, 32.","response":"DM: 32. He is (impact noise) from barely damaged to nothing. He goes immediately unconscious in the corner, face down, in the middle of a bookcase."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I drop 18 points of healing into Vouk.","response":"DM: Okay. (gasps, chokes)"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The rag's in his throat. You are going to listen very carefully as my friends ask you some questions. You'll shake your head yes or shake it no.\nLAURA: What are we going to ask him?\nTALIESIN: I'm not available right now.\nLIAM: Come on. Come with me.\nLAURA: Okay.\nSAM: Where are the Briarwoods?\nLAURA: Where are the Briarwoods?\nLIAM: You've got to do yes or no.\nLAURA: Are the Briarwoods–\nSAM: – in the palace?","response":"DM: (muffled moaning)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes or no.\nSAM: Just nod or nod.\nLAURA: This is really smart. I feel good about this.\nTRAVIS: Should we take the rag out?\nLAURA: No.\nSAM: He can do spells.\nLIAM: I just want to remind you that my friend over here can split you in half like an apple, right?\nTRAVIS: I nod his head yes.","response":"DM: (muffled murmur)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Have you seen the Briarwoods this week?","response":"DM: (affirmative grunt)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do you like working for them?","response":"DM: (sounds uncertain)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do they know we're here?","response":"DM: (affirmative grunt)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nSAM: Are they in the palace?","response":"DM: (sounds ambiguous)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Sometimes.\nLAURA: Do you know where they are?","response":"DM: (negative grunt)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do they have pointier teeth than most?","response":"DM: (sounds ambiguous)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: This is mumblecore.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: Is your life worth giving a little information?","response":"DM: (affirmative grunting)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We want to know how to get into the palace without a problem. Got any advice?","response":"DM: (eager affirmative grunting)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Now I just want to remind you. He can take your head off, your knees off, your cock off, anything, in half a second.\nTRAVIS: I just give a little squeeze.\nLIAM: I'm going to pull the cloth out.\nSAM: I cast Blindness on him.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Don't know if he's blind.","response":"DM: Suddenly he goes (muffled panic noises)."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, he's blind. He's blind.\nLIAM: I give him a pat on the cheek.","response":"DM: (whimpers)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, now I feel bad.\nLIAM: I'm a big fan of efficiency, so I'm going to pull this rag out and you've got about 30 seconds to start talking about something useful. Otherwise, my friend is going to make you about six inches shorter.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. I'm going to turn your head into a dreidel.\nLIAM: So we're going to start talking now, yes?","response":"DM: (grunts in agreement)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: In three, two.","response":"DM: (gasping for breath) “Please don't kill me. I can show you a secret entrance into the castle. I know a way in.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's not guarded?","response":"DM: “I don't think so. They've closed it off. If you can find a way through, they won't expect it.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is it the one in the forest?","response":"DM: “There is one, yes, yes, in the forest. Look, I can bring you to their project room under the castle, what they're working on. Please don't kill me.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What is the project room?\nSAM: Are they working on explosives?","response":"DM: “They've been– They've been working on something. It's hard to describe. I've only been there once. It's beyond my interests, but it is part of the reason they even took this place.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Lord Briarwood is a vampire.","response":"DM: “Aye.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What the fuck is Lady Briarwood?","response":"DM: “She's powerful, I'll give you that. She scares me more than the two of them.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it hard to talk with no teeth?","response":"DM: “It's more difficult than expected, aye.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I start to tilt his head and I'm like: showing us won't work, we need a location.","response":"DM: “It's under the castle. It's under the city. All the caverns are there. I can show you how to get there, I've been there. They've taken me.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do you know what they've done to the ground here? Do you know why nothing grows?","response":"DM: “Stuff grows. It's how we do the farming.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Stuff doesn't grow, though. Not like it should. What did they do to the land?","response":"DM: “I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with what they're doing under the castle.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And what exactly are they doing under the castle?","response":"DM: “It's an excavation, or they're building something. I don't know the details of it.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You've no idea what they want?","response":"DM: “Comparatively, I'm just a peasant to them. I work with– well, I worked with Kerrion.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How long have you worked with Sir Stonefell?","response":"DM: “Five years.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Were you here when he took the castle?","response":"DM: “Yes, yes. I was part of the incursion.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Good. You're very lucky. Because you're going to live if you show us– And I bring out a map.\nSAM: He can't see anything.\nTALIESIN: I know. Drop the Blindness.","response":"DM: He hears the crinkling of paper."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Drop the Blindness.","response":"DM: (scared, fast breathing)"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Look at me. Look at me. You're going to show me where on the castle is the secret entrance. Do you know who I am?","response":"DM: “No.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You will. Mark it on the map.","response":"DM: He looks down at his bound arms and legs."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I take his head and I shove his nose and his face right above the map. And I say: use your nose.","response":"DM: “It's right–” He spits and puts a little droplet. It's loosely in the area of the western side of the mountain that the castle is built on. Roughly around the entrance where you escaped when you and Cassandra left Whitestone, five years before."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I know where that is.\nTRAVIS: That means we don't need you anymore.","response":"DM: “No! I can show you– I can show you where their project is. The tunnels. You need me.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He'll set a good trap.\nLAURA: I just want to ask, when do the Briarwoods come out?","response":"DM: “Not often. They don't need to. Kerrion does the work for them. Did the work for them.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Those giants. Who controls them?","response":"DM: “Lady Briarwood does. She's the one who made them.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's all over the room.\nMARISHA: She's the one who made them?\nTALIESIN: Can I propose something to you?","response":"DM: “She's strong with necromancy, she is.”"}

That's a natural 20.\nMARISHA: Natural 20?!\nTALIESIN: Natural 20, really? I'm feeling like such a bastard right now.","response":"DM: There isn't even a slow scuffle. You just reach in and (wet ripping noise, pained scream) You immediately jam the cloth back in. The cloth begins to slowly soak with blood. You hold almost a pound of muscle: a now motionless tongue in your hand, bloody at its base. These tears are running down his face. (muffled sobbing and coughing)"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is that good enough for your message?\nTALIESIN: I take my gun. I'm going to shoot it very gently– I'm going to shoot into the ground to muffle the sound. I'm going to take the heat of it, and I'm going to cauterize it. His tongue, so he doesn't bleed out.","response":"DM: You pull the cloth out. (pained cry and choking sounds)"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to mark his head with the still-hot gun.","response":"DM: (noises of pain) He starts screaming in pain as you're burning what into his head, the symbol of the de Rolo family?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to do it. And then, I say we let him run out the front door and we set fire to the house.\nTRAVIS: I'm good with that. I've got this.\nSAM: Where are we going after this?\nMARISHA: Whoa!\nTRAVIS: No. I like that a lot.\nMARISHA: You would, though. You would.\nSAM: Trinket's downstairs. We should leave Trinket.\nTRAVIS: Have we forgotten that this entire town is full of evil, undead vampire people?\nMARISHA: Have we also forgotten that this entire town is looking for us?\nTALIESIN: They don't know we're here.\nMARISHA: They will after we set fire on the house and send a man screaming through the street with your symbol on his forehead.\nSAM: They don't know where we live.\nMARISHA: They will! They're going to go, “Hm, let's look at the burning smokestack of a house and start there.”\nTALIESIN: He's going to be missing by morning. They're going to know.\nTRAVIS: We've got the guy painted all over this room. They're going to find out one way or the other. Might as well do it with a little showmanship.\nSAM: We're trying to make everyone know that we're here.\nTALIESIN: We're trying to start a rebellion.\nMARISHA: (voice cracking) Yeah, but– yeah.\nTRAVIS: Come on, be the Mockingjay, Keyleth!\nTRAVIS: It is!\nSAM: We can stay the night before we release him and burn it down.\nTALIESIN: Fair.\nSAM: Although there are a bunch of guards around.\nMARISHA and LAURA: We can't stay the night.\nMARISHA: Hang on. Fellow half-elves, you look as horrified as I feel. What do you guys think?\nLAURA: I feel like it's a little stupid, since we have nowhere to go.\nSAM: We can go back to our old hideout. We have the tavern. No one's found it.\nLIAM: Percival, I know what you've been through, to an extent.\nTALIESIN: I don't even know what I've been through, to a certain extent, but yes.\nLIAM: We came here to wipe out a scourge on this city. Careful lest you become the scourge you've come to destroy. These people have eaten shit for five years. I'm not saying that man was innocent, but he's had a hard road. Everyone here has had a hard road. I am maybe willing to overlook what's just happened for all the hardship you have had, but careful how you are walking.\nSAM: Hey, wait a second here, Vax. That was an enforcer. He kept the people oppressed. He worked for the Briarwoods and punished all of these farmers for not bringing enough taxes and enough tithes.\nLIAM: Are we to turn into Jack the Ripper because of it?\nSAM: Well, that's what a rebellion is.\nTRAVIS: I do like ripping.\nTALIESIN: There's no pretty way to do this.\nLAURA: I'm fully in support with burning down a house, I just feel like it might backfire a bit.\nMARISHA: Look, I agreed to start a rebellion and let the people have their uprising, but I'm with Vax. I was trying to tell you this before we even came here, Percy. You don't want to become the thing that you are so desperate to seek vengeance on. How are we any different than the Briarwoods, at this point?\nTRAVIS: We're not fucking vampires. Look, what are our options besides burning the house down? I'm open to other ideas.\nSAM: We can just leave it as a symbol of our terror.\nTALIESIN: I've marked him. I'm willing to walk away.\nTRAVIS: And where do we stay?\nSAM: Somewhere else.\nTRAVIS: The tavern? Do we have to find another building?\nTALIESIN: I know a barracks. It's not too far away.\nLIAM: I agree with you, with burning the house down. Let's find anyone who's in here and get them out.\nTALIESIN: I think they'll get out when the house catches on fire.\nLIAM: Your soul doesn't need to be forfeit, Percival.\nTALIESIN: (sighs heavily) Things are more complicated now.\nSAM: Percy, is that last barrel for you?\nTALIESIN: No. But, if it was, would I tell you?\nSAM: No.\nTALIESIN: Thank you.\nMARISHA: Why are things more complicated, Percy? Clearly, we all just witnessed what just happened.\nTALIESIN: That was unexpected.\nMARISHA: Yeah, no, I'd agree with that, yeah.\nTALIESIN: (sighs) That's a longer conversation.\nSAM: These guards aren't going to stay out for long. We should set fire and get out of here.\nLIAM: We burn the house down, and we find a place to hole up for the night.\nLAURA: Hey, buddy. How's it going?","response":"DM: He looks over at the body of Sir Kerrion, which is still slumped against the wall."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Percy, we need to have that longer conversation soon.\nLAURA: Soon, but not now. Let's go.\nLAURA: Let's do it.\nTRAVIS: I take the tongue-less one, and I throw him out. I keep him bound. He's bound amongst the chest and hands. And I throw him out the window. Bye, motherfucker!","response":"DM: He falls out into the rain, (boof) falling on his side.

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He'll get up. His feet are free. His legs and feet are free. I'm picturing chest and arms.","response":"DM: Okay, then he gets to his feet and starts running."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Grog, can you carry this unconscious guard out on our way out?\nTRAVIS: Sure. Do I kill him first?","response":"DM: Are you leaving Sir Kerrion's body?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Sir Kerrion's body?","response":"DM: Are you leaving Sir Kerrion's body to burn with the house?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.\nLAURA: Are we?\nTALIESIN: Let's take him, too.\nTRAVIS: We might as well leave him out on the front step, or something. I'll grab Sir Kerrion–\nSAM: Can you carry both of those fuckers?\nTRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: He threw one of them out."}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, there's the unconscious guard and the body.\nTRAVIS: I'll grab unconscious guard and the body.\nLIAM: He weighs like 600 pounds.\nSAM: You have fire hands.\nMARISHA: We're at least going to make it cool and make it the message that it's supposed to be.\nTRAVIS: There you go!\nMARISHA: I turn into an eagle and I fly to the roof.","response":"DM: Flying out the window that you just shattered."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Give me your symbol.\nTALIESIN: I give her one of the parchments.","response":"DM: You fly up. The rain is coming down on you. It's a little hard to fly. You get up to the top of the roof."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I cast Flaming Sphere.","response":"DM: You transform into yourself again?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: We're all going to start going out the way we came.\nTRAVIS: I throw unconscious guy and Sir Dead.\nMARISHA: Hope you guys were ready to get out.\nLAURA: I open up a bottle of wine and take a giant swig.","response":"DM: Okay. As you guys head back down to the cellar?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: You guys all head back down to the cellar. You throw them both out the window, including the body of Sir Kerrion (boof) out into the yard. You head back down into the cellar."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I cast Flaming Sphere, and I start moving it around on the roof and start drawing the shape of the de Rolo family crest on the roof.","response":"DM: Okay. It will take you a few minutes. You now see, as you're finishing the symbol, Vouk running to the front of the building, and you hear the voices of two guards going, “Master Vouk? What happened? Tell us. Unbind him!” “Yes, sir.” And the two guards at the front of the building are talking with him. You finish the symbol."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I take my Flaming Sphere, and I throw it right at the feet of where the guards are.","response":"DM: Okay. You're on the roof, so you don't see them, but you know they're off to the side of the roof, so you can roll it off the roof down to them. They both freak out and react and seem to get into a defensive position. They start arming themselves, and you hear crossbow bolts being set into place."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I run over to the edge where the cellar was, and I go, (whispering) Grog. Grog!\nTRAVIS: What?\nMARISHA: (whispering) Come to the side of the roof!","response":"DM: You guys make your ways back down through the cellar, where Trinket's waiting patiently. (bear grunts)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hey, buddy. Let's go.\nTRAVIS: Hi, Trinket. Get out.","response":"DM: You guys come out of the cellar now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (whispering) Grog! Hey!\nTRAVIS: What?\nMARISHA: (whispering) Catch me!\nTRAVIS: Okay!","response":"DM: Catch Keyleth. You guys are now out in the open, still during the day, rain pouring down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Running toward the woods? Where are we running?\nMARISHA: Get the fuck out of here.\nTALIESIN: Let's head back to the inn. Let's try the barracks. We'll try the barracks.","response":"DM: The barracks are attached to the castle."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Shit. Okay.\nSAM: Back to the tavern, then.\nTALIESIN: Back to the tavern for now.\nLAURA: They're going to notice–","response":"DM: Stealth check real fast, guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I was going to say, do you have Pass Without a Trace, can you summon any more spells?\nLAURA: I don't. I mean, I can cast it right now.","response":"DM: If you want to quickly, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, before we move.","response":"DM: Stealth checks?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 19.\nLIAM: Did we get the Pass Without a Trace?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: So, plus ten, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 34.\nTALIESIN: 20.\nMARISHA: 25.\nTRAVIS: 21.\nLAURA: 24.","response":"DM: Sure enough, both guards rush around the corner. You guys have already leapt over the fence. However, they see the fence. “The fence is bent!” And they go rushing toward that direction. You guys have already disappeared into the various alleyways, making your way back towards the inn in the center of town."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Pass Without a Trace, I mean, Dust of Tracelessness.\nTRAVIS: Okay, yeah, just throwing it down behind us.","response":"DM: Okay. They're giving chase. They're hearing the sounds of your footsteps a little, but eventually their sounds fade. You do hear in the distance a bell start going off."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're going to go into the basement.","response":"DM: You start seeing people emerging from their homes, hearing the bell. And, you would know this, this would be a warning bell for whenever a fire breaks out in the city. You see smoke beginning to rise up, even through the rainstorm. The fire is fighting the rain. But the smoke is black and it's starting to fade. You gather the building itself did not catch fire enough to burn into rubble due to the rain, but you've probably left a very visible mark on the roof."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That'll do.","response":"DM: People begin to gather from the outside, and you see folks running past the alley as you make your way back to the tavern that you currently have as your base of operations. You all make your way in safely from the rain. Take a deep breath and come to understand that you've definitely started the motion of whatever it is you're intending to do. We'll see how it plays out in the near future. We'll call the session there for the night."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Shit got hairy.\nTALIESIN: That was amazing.\nLAURA: That was dark, you guys. Super dark.\nSAM: I found seven gold.\nTALIESIN: I have a sword, now.\nTRAVIS: It's October.\nMARISHA: Speaking of Percy and his crazy storyline–\nTALIESIN: So that's about to happen, yeah.\nMARISHA: I'm guessing by now if you go on the Geek and Sundry website, you can find his playlist.","response":"DM: Yeah, sure."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Taliesin art.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, I drew pictures. Just in case everybody wants to see, this is the terrible thing we keep carving into people and things.\nMARISHA: Or burning on rooftops.\nTALIESIN: And then this is actually the de Rolo family crest. Just another fancy thing.","response":"DM: Very, very cool, and well done, sir."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Thank you. I drew a picture. So that shit happened.\nMARISHA: Glad I'm not the only one who thinks you're crazy anymore.\nTALIESIN: I think I'm crazy now. It's gonna be interesting.\nMARISHA: You're all crazy, we've all seen it. Now we can handle it as a family.\nZAC: Yeah, y'all's fucked up.\nTALIESIN: That got way darker than I was expecting.\nZAC: Yeah. I'm sure that won't have any negative repercussions whatsoever.","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I hate you, Matt.\nLAURA: Hey, man. Did we hit 10k?\nZAC: Yep.\nZAC: 10,060. Currently Starburns is winning.\nMARISHA and TALIESIN: Starburns! Do it!\nZAC: Here's what they forget: Jess and Steph are the ones doing it. If anyone's watched Jess and Steph's craft show, it will most likely end up being just a shaved face. If you think Jess and Steph can pull off Starburns, you're lying to yourself, and it will just end up being a clean shave.\nTALIESIN: I got a straight razor, we could go for this. You trust me, I mean, you know. I can get in there.\nZAC: Moving on.\nTALIESIN: I can Sweeney Todd that.\nZAC: Okay, so. Tonight, guys, we're just gonna be reading off the names and we're gonna knock through 'em pretty quick.\nZAC: Well, one's the original and one's the second.","response":"DM: Oh, it carried over, I see. I see. The original and the second. There's a third one in there, probably. Guys, thank you so much. It's really incredible, each one of you that donated to help Extra Life. We really appreciate it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But in the meantime, don't forget to go to LA2050 and vote for 826LA so they can win 100k.\nZAC: I would also like to throw out there the other– it currently looks like it's a race between Starburns, Freddie Mercury, and Fu Manchu.\nLAURA: Oh, I like Freddie Mercury.\nTALIESIN: Starburns' really kinda rocking it for me.\nMARISHA: I was gonna suggest– we had the Hunger Games reference, so what was his name? Kerrion or whatever? The Gamemaster in the first one?\nZAC: There is no way Steph and Jess have the ability to do something like that.","response":"DM: I almost wanna see the tristache. Tristache is when you shave the handlebar, and then a smaller handlebar, and then a smaller–"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Poll's out. The poll's out, dude.\nSAM: Is the Hitler on the poll at all?\n(groaning)\nTALIESIN: You're a terrible person! That is the worst thing I've heard yet.\nSAM: The Charlie Chaplin.","response":"DM: Fantastic, thank you so much."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Stick around tomorrow for Jess and Steph's birthday, where they cut my fucking face up.\nTRAVIS: Damn straight!","response":"DM: Welcome back. So to get you guys up to speed with the current situation, in our currently non-air conditioned studio– great day for this to coincide. Vox Machina had an encounter with two individuals known as the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, who currently control Whitestone, the city that Percival– Taliesin's character– once lived in, his family once essentially ruled, before they were usurped and most of them murdered by the Briarwoods. So upon meeting them, a vengeance urge kicked up within Percival. The rest of the party following him to Whitestone to attempt to free the city from the clutches of the very seemingly evil and in some cases undead Briarwoods, as the Lord Briarwood appears to be vampiric in nature. After arriving, they had some stealth missions, they went around and discovered a fair warning on the Sun Tree, one of the central items of Whitestone, a relic of Pelor from long ago that the city was built around, now dead and holding a series of bodies hung from it, all dressed and painted to look like the members of Vox Machina. While they were there, they managed to find and hole up in an abandoned tavern. Closing the windows off, and after doing a little bit of digging, spoke to the head of the Lady's Chamber, the temple to Erathis to which Percival and most of the team seems to be interested in starting a rebellion in Whitestone. They planted the seed there to return to germinate at some point. And then began to follow a couple of individuals, or at least an individual that was partially responsible for the really honestly shitty social atmosphere in Whitestone. Following him back to a home, it was discovered that Sir Kerrion, one of the individuals responsible for the death of Percival's family, was still part of the ruling class here. The party then snuck in through the bottom of the building, stealthed into a full surprise ambush upon him and his  compatriots. Murdered most of them. They took his toady, essentially, Vouk, and instead of murdering him, tore out his tongue and then burned the de Rolo family crest into his forehead–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You say they. Not quite how I remember it.\nTALIESIN: The way you're putting that is a lot worse than actually–","response":"DM: I know, but it's fun to push it that way."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I feel this is a little one-sided.","response":"DM: But yeah, with his tongue removed and the symbol burned into his forehead, he was thrown out the window, and the party then escaped into the night rain, returning to their tavern, and that was where we left off. So. As you guys come in from the soaking-wet rain that seemed to have been now pouring continuously through the city of Whitestone, you come to the quiet of your tavern, the sun beginning to find its way, setting across the evening sky. What would you like to do?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm having a real hard time roleplaying right now.","response":"DM: I don't know what you mean. What are you doing Vax? Come on."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's actually really difficult to play a character when you're dressed as a different character, not going to lie.","response":"DM: Well, we're going to learn!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're going to learn how to do it.\nMARISHA: You wanna roleplay as the character you're dressed as. Yeah, it's hard. Don't do that.\nTRAVIS: I don't know, I feel as groggy as ever.","response":"DM: I don't think Scanlan's going to have a problem tonight."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Nope, this is how I imagine myself to be.\nLIAM: I am not going to look at that table at all tonight. All auditory for you three. Sorry.\nLAURA: So we are– wait, I forget.","response":"DM: You guys just now returned to the tavern."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're in the tavern. It's nighttime now?","response":"DM: It's starting to push later into the evening, now you guys have returned to the tavern."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And as we returned to the tavern, did we see hustle and bustle of people rising up in rebellion, by any chance?","response":"DM: Not yet."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Overnight rebellion!","response":"DM: It's been fairly fresh since you even started the word of it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We were very discreet and discreetly putting the Dust of Tracelessness on the ground.","response":"DM: Yes, you were, and you're finding your way through, there doesn't appear to be anyone following. Plus there was a large distraction with Sir Kerrion's homestead being lit on fire. The rain taking care of most of it, but it drew people out of their homes to see this giant blazing symbol of the de Rolo family burning across the rooftop. So a message was definitely left and probably received by somebody, and what are your plans?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: One down, how many left? How many are there left?\nMARISHA: Four? Four.\nTALIESIN: Four.\nTRAVIS: There are five total? Whoa, I did math.\nMARISHA: There are six barrels. One is empty.\nSAM: Do you think the other two are– the barrel names: so two are Sylas and Delilah.\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nSAM: And we know that one of the other two barrel names resides in that place that we found. The countess, what was her name? The doctor?\nTALIESIN: Doctor Ripley.\nSAM: And what's the fourth name?\nTALIESIN: Professor Anders.\nLAURA: Are we really going to talk about names right now and not about the giant creepy smoke monster that came out of you, Percy?\nLIAM: I think we need to find a place to lay low. Not here, not where we've been. Somewhere else. I think we need to scope out another place.\nLAURA: I don't think it's safe to leave tonight.\nSAM: I agree with Vex that we can't leave tonight. The streets are going to be crawling with guards and people looking for us.\nMARISHA: Are we back in our hole where we were?","response":"DM: You're back in the tavern where you guys were."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It might be smart to be down in the cellar tonight, not up.\nTALIESIN: I agree.\nSAM: Is there any sort of way you can close us in and make it look like it's a single-story dwelling?\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nLIAM: Yeah, we'll go down to the tree and we'll make it look like no one's ever tunneled down there before.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I mean we can literally camp next to the roots of the tree if we want to. I made it look nice in there.\nLAURA: Okay.\nMARISHA: I can clear out a bit more space.\nLAURA: Burt, your mustache is falling off.\nSAM: It is?\nMARISHA: Speaking of nervous habits.\nSAM: One of us has a nervous habit of ejecting smoke from his rib cage.\nMARISHA: I was also thinking about the weird cough that you have. I don't think you're getting sick. What's going on? Oh, and we've tunneled, right? We're below the ground.","response":"DM: You guys have made your way to the inn, if you all wanted to go down and to the tree–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Let's go down into the cellar. I'm going to go ahead and throw up some walls.\nTRAVIS: Walls, or the false ground?\nMARISHA: I can do the false terrain–\nLAURA: Yeah, do that.\nMARISHA: I'll do Hallucinatory Terrain, and I will make it look like she said. One story, no cellar.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So the opening to the cellar will be just a dirt floor.\nMARISHA: Just wooden floor, yeah.\nMARISHA: No one's here, looks like it hasn't been touched.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Those eyes make you look far more sarcastic than you normally do.","response":"DM: Do they?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (shouting) Argh, god!\nLAURA: And he doesn't even smile at all.\nTRAVIS: Jeez, you're the worst.\nLIAM: So Percival, spill your guts. What the fuck is going on?\nTALIESIN: I don't entirely know. Where to begin?\nLIAM: You didn't look surprised when that happened.\nMARISHA: No, in fact, you pulled down your mask, which you don't normally do in battles.\nTALIESIN: It felt– it didn't feel like a surprise. I don't know. It didn't feel good. I was hoping it would.\nLAURA: You didn't seem to mind it as it was happening.\nTALIESIN: I think I wanted him to recognize me.\nMARISHA: Who?\nTALIESIN: Kerrion. I don't know. I was hoping it would feel better.\nMARISHA: Could you feel it happening while it was? Were you conscious? Do you remember what you did?\nLIAM: What the fuck is it? What is it, Percival? What is it?\nTALIESIN: A few years ago, I had a dream. I had a very intense dream, and in this dream, something asked me if I wanted revenge. If I wanted the means to have revenge. And all I would have to do in return is offer up the souls of those I took.\nLAURA: (flatly) Oh, that's all.\nSAM: Wait, what?\nTALIESIN: It was a dream! It was just a dream.\nSAM: And yet you've fashioned your entire life's goal upon this dream.\nTALIESIN: I woke up in the morning with an idea, and I built that idea. I thought it was prophetic, and lately I've been feeling a bit of strain, and recalling it, but it was just a dream!\nSAM: So the day after this dream was when you first developed your Pepperbox?\nTALIESIN: It's not the first time I felt inspired in my life. I just– it wasn't real.\nMARISHA: And Percy, how long after the coup and after you lost your family was this dream?\nTALIESIN: (sighs) Maybe a year. I was fuzzy at first; I wasn't really me anymore. I was a fisherman for a while. I didn't do anything. This was something to do with myself; this was something to work towards.\nLIAM: Well, we're clearly not talking about a dream anymore. We all saw it. Do you have any theories?\nTALIESIN: I don't. I don't know. I've never thought about it. It didn't matter.\nLIAM: It matters now.\nTALIESIN: I don't know what to do.\nLAURA: Who is the last bullet for?\nTALIESIN: (sighs)\nLAURA: We don't want to lose you, Percy.\nTALIESIN: When I started this, I talked to a man, at one point. He was the captain of one of the vessels I was on. I told him what I intended to do, and I showed him what I was building. And he said that if I really wanted revenge, if revenge was what I was after, that there would be no stopping it. And there would be casualties along the way, and I would have to give up things, and I would have to hurt people. And that was the price, so that last barrel is because it's not just five names; I know I'm going to have to keep hurting people and that this thing existing is just going to keep hurting people. It's the knowledge that it never ends. It's because I haven't just killed five people. I've killed a lot of people on my way here. I've killed them with you. And it's to remind me that this is what I've chosen.\nLIAM: I don't understand. We've killed with reason.\nTALIESIN: And I have tried to. And I certainly have reason for these five names. They are not good people. These are not people who should be allowed to live.\nLIAM: None of us debate that the Briarwoods and their circle should be allowed to go on. We all understand what they're capable of. We all understand that they need to be removed. But what we just saw goes beyond, and you're telling us that this is going to continue after the Briarwoods and their like are gone. What are we to look forward to, Percival? Where are we going?\nTALIESIN: I was hoping that once I'd finished serving revenge that perhaps I could serve repentance.\nMARISHA: You're speaking of these as if they're metaphysical beings. You're serving revenge. That sounds very literal, and from what I've seen, isn't inaccurate.\nTALIESIN: I no longer feel in control. I no longer trust myself. I wouldn't expect you to trust me.\nLIAM: Stretching a little thin right now, Percy.\nTALIESIN: But I trust you.\nSAM: Can I just do a quick insight to see if he's being entirely honest?","response":"DM: You may."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, that didn't work. Much better. 18.","response":"DM: 18. Go ahead and roll a dice, Percival."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Dice plus what?","response":"DM: Actually, I'll roll it for you. What's your bonus?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: For which?","response":"DM: For both persuasion and deception."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Persuasion and deception? Persuasion, six. Deception, two.","response":"DM: Okay. He seems very earnest, very broken. Confused, but driven, and there isn't any part of his voice that seems to conceal or attempt to hold back any information."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are you afraid you're going to hurt us?\nTALIESIN: No. I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you.\nMARISHA: How would you disappoint us?\nTALIESIN: I trust that you are all here in the service of justice and maybe friendship. But I'm not. I'm here for revenge. And as much as I would like to believe otherwise, I know that's not true. And I think I need people here who are not here for revenge. I don't know how to stop this.\nMARISHA: Just because you started on this path for revenge doesn't mean you can't find other motivations along the way. Do you believe you're not doing this with your friends or for your friends? Not even a little bit; it's only a hundred percent revenge?\nTALIESIN: No one does anything purely for one reason. And I could justify it, but I'd be lying. I want to hurt them. I want them to know it's me. I want them to feel remorse for what they have done. I want them to pay, and if this thing is real, if this is really what is happening now, I hope that wherever they go, they suffer forever and beyond.\nTRAVIS: I think that sounds fair.\nTALIESIN: And I'm so grateful there is justice to be found in it, but it is not justice that I am motivated by. And I couldn't pretend it would be. I am so grateful there is justice in this. But even if there wasn't, I would still be here.\nLIAM: I want to talk about a plan, because our desires are in lockstep up to a point. Once we have gotten rid of the last of them, I want to know what happens then, Percival.\nTALIESIN: I've never had to think of this before. I think if we get out of this, either I'm going to need you to save me or finish me.\nLAURA: No, we won't do that.\nTALIESIN: If it comes to it.\nLAURA: Damn it, where is Pike?! She would know about this.\nTRAVIS: She would.\nMARISHA: I miss Pike.\nTALIESIN: Well, I do want to save this city.\nLAURA: Can we do any kind of religion check to see if we know anything about this kind of entity?","response":"DM: Yeah, go ahead and make a religion check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Three.","response":"DM: Suiting."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 17.","response":"DM: I mean, there are all sorts of extraplanar entities throughout the realms that have their own individual descriptions."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Whenever he starts a description with “I mean,” it's not good.","response":"DM: You don't have a whole lot of experience outside of the realm of mortals. You've had a few interactions with things that skew beyond that realm. While you get that he's saying it may just be a dream, you know that there are multitudes of creatures that thrive on these types of bargains. You do know that many of these bargains in the long run do not end up being wholly in the person's favor who struck it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well, look. It's going to help him on his quest, get revenge and kill all the people that killed his family, right? So can we do that, and then if it gets out of control, we bop him on the head and take him to a temple?\nLAURA: I think that's the best plan we have, actually.\nTRAVIS: I mean, you were really awesome in that last fight.\nLAURA: You did look pretty amazing, I'm not going to lie.\nTRAVIS: A little bit of pee came out. It was that good.\nLAURA: But I don't like how dark it went, Percy. It went really dark.\nLIAM: And here's the thing. There's a thing. There it is, right there. Here's the thing.\nTALIESIN: Oh god, I hadn't even noticed. So sorry.\nLIAM: Your chances of succeeding here alone are pretty fucking slim. And if you want us all to work with you, you can't go from door to door, bringing wrath and ruin the way you just did, or you won't have our assistance. Not all of us.\nSAM: Now now, Vax, what are you talking about? We all knew what we were doing when we– pay attention to me! I'm trying to be serious here. Don't you turn your eyes away from me. Look at me when I'm talking to you. We all knew what we were doing when we went into the house. It was an assassination mission. I don't understand why everyone's harping on how dark it got. We knew we were there to kill everyone in the whole place.\nLIAM: This is a city oppressed. These people did not invite it upon themselves.\nLAURA: That guy deserved it, but we did rip his tongue out, which I think was a bit harsh.\nTRAVIS: He said take his tongue.\nLIAM: These people don't want to exchange one warlord for another. We need to maybe dial it back a tick or two.\nSAM: No, I disagree.\nTRAVIS: I do, too, Pedostache.\nSAM: We have to make a strong appearance. This is shock and awe. We're not going to win over the people by half measures and hey, let's hold an election, or something. We have to kill everyone in as dramatic a fashion as possible.\nLAURA: This is beheading a pony all over again.\nLIAM: You think we're going to win them over by showing them how disgusting we are?\nSAM: No, how disgusting they are, and how disgusting they die.\nLIAM: No. I mean the civilians here.\nLAURA: We're not going to kill civilians!\nLIAM: Of course, but we're trying to win them over, and if we're showing that we're ripping out their tongues and pulling their ears off and flaying their balls, they're going to be just as scared of us as they are of the Briarwoods.\nLAURA: They'll probably be pretty happy that the people that have been hurting them are being punished.\nMARISHA: Yes, they've been oppressed, but we've also seen there's plenty of cases of people being charmed by them. We might have an army of people who will die for the Briarwoods at any cost and not even realizing they're being charmed that way.\nSAM: I wouldn't mind a few people being scared of us, too.\nTALIESIN: I will say it did get out of hand. And if I had known then what I know now, I would hope that you would restrain me in those moments where I seem to be going further than I should.\nLAURA: Done.\nTRAVIS: Are you saying for your final bullet, you want us to stop you?\nLAURA: No, he's saying that if he goes dark, if he goes against his person that we know–\nTALIESIN: Knock me out and take me to a temple.\nTRAVIS: You don't want to scratch the name off the barrel?\nTALIESIN: I didn't know it was going to disappear, to be fair. I thought that maybe I could stop what was happening to me. I panicked.\nMARISHA: Percy, do you realize we tried to talk to you for a good 15 minutes after all that last night, and you were unreachable? Do you remember that? So us saying if you start getting out of control, and you think that we're going to be able to be like, yo Percy, calm it down a bit–\nLAURA: We're not going to do that. We're going to knock him the fuck out!\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nLAURA: Don't worry, Percy. We've got you.\nSAM: I don't think I would knock him out.\nTRAVIS: I'll knock you out if you really want me to.\nTALIESIN: If I start to turn against you. If you think for a moment that I am out of control. Please, please, do what is necessary. The moment that I turn on any of you, the moment that I even threaten any of you is a moment I am not in control. No matter what is happening.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Okay.\nLAURA: I walk up and I kiss him on the cheek, and I say: Don't you worry, we've got you.\nTALIESIN: Especially with the cough, thank you.\nLAURA: I don't believe you're really sick, darling.\nSAM: Vex, I've heard a cough like that, and it's probably syphilis.\nLAURA: Lovely. Thank you, Scanlan.\nTALIESIN: I barely sl– I don't, I–\nSAM: Personal experience, that's all I'm saying.\nTRAVIS: Shall we rest and then we go find another house?\nMARISHA: Well, maybe we should, now that we have the knock-Percy-out-in-case-of-emergency plan, should we have a revolution plan? Because we seem to be divided on that.\nTALIESIN: There's still two more lords in the city. And there is the castle. They know we're here now.\nSAM: It might behoove us to spend a day or two finding another shelter, and also seeing what our actions have resulted in, and seeing if we can't sway some opinion in our favor, because we're strong, but we're also pretty weak these days, and I wouldn't want to go against the big guns yet until we have the people behind us. Or at least possibly turn one of those giants to our side or something. We need some help.\nLAURA: We have a map of the city, yes? I think it best to stay off the streets. Is it possible, Keyleth, to tunnel through the city, underneath it?\nTALIESIN: Good idea.\nMARISHA: I can, actually. Yeah.\nSAM: Can't really talk to people that way.\nLAURA: No, but they know we're here. It's not safe. We can come up in secret, leave symbols to rally the people, and hide again.\nMARISHA: You want to get a beat on the vibe of what people are saying out there?\nSAM: Hey, hep cat, yes. I'm wanting to get a beat on the vibe. Yes, I think we need to hear what people are saying. In the privacy of their homes, maybe. Do some snooping.\nMARISHA: Well, there's a few people in our party who are good at that.\nSAM: And we need to find another potential safehouse.\nMARISHA: Okay, that's plan number one, then. I think it's not a bad idea that we spread this de Rolo family crest around.\nTALIESIN: Have we been to the Alcove yet?","response":"DM: You went to the Alcove– no, you have not been to the Alcove."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We haven't been to the Alcove or the barracks yet. The barracks are right against the castle, though.","response":"DM: Correct. You went to the Lady's Chamber and you spoke briefly with Keeper Yennen."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, with Keeper Yennen.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, let's go to the barracks.","response":"DM: And you went to Beyond the Horizon, which was abandoned and partially collapsed."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The barracks will be our last stop, I believe. Just because it's outside the city proper and it's up the hill. We might be able to stay at the Alcove, which is a magic shop that used to be in town. I know the proprietor, or I did, if he's still alive.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, let's go there.\nMARISHA: Magic shop? Okay.\nTALIESIN: It was a magic shop, right?","response":"DM: Yeah, it's an arcane boutique, yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: An arcane boutique.\nMARISHA: Are we tunneling there?\nLAURA: Are we going there now? Are we resting?\nSAM: We should rest.\nMARISHA: It's nighttime!","response":"DM: Right now, I would say, based on preparation, the illusion-casting, conversation, you're looking at about 9:00, 9:30 in the evening."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We could get an early start once the light hits.\nSAM: If you fall asleep, is that illusion going to vanish?\nMARISHA: No, I think Hallucinatory Terrain lasts for–\nLAURA: Can I sense anything near us? Can I sense vampires above us?","response":"DM: So you're looking for undead?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Undead.","response":"DM: Okay. You feel a surrounding presence scattered throughout the city, some large, some small. You can gather over a period of time of concentration, you can feel the slow movement of the zombie giants moving through the city, the sentinels slowly tromping through, and a number of other undead entities there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does it feel like there's more in motion than there were before we set off the blaze?","response":"DM: I would say yes, there appears to be a little more haste and movement to what entities you can– and you can't pinpoint specifics, but you do sense that there is a heightened state of movement, to what you've previously sensed."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nLIAM: Yes I've a thought that at night, obviously, these streets are full of dead things. Tomorrow, the Briarwoods and the people that work for them are going to start pulling people out of their houses and telling them to look for us or anyone who's not from this city, so I don't think that the beggar routine is going to work for much longer.\nLAURA: That's why we stay under the city. That's what I said.\nLIAM: Of course, but if you want to talk to people, I think we could probably get away with poking about first thing in the morning and that's it.\nMARISHA: Okay.\nLIAM: So we should probably get up early.\nSAM: And in addition to your excellent illusion spell–\nMARISHA: Which lasts for 24 hours.\nSAM: That's wonderful to hear. Is there any other means of protection we have? I mean, if they are magic wielders, they might be able to sense our presence or something. Is there any way to obscure that? I guess I'm asking this, but I'm one of the only two magic wielders here, so I should know the answer.\nMARISHA: I was going to say, it would be probably a me and you thing. In terms of making us not a noticeable, Seeming is probably going to be our closest thing. I don't have anything–\nSAM: It's just a visual, though.\nLAURA: Nothing like a bubble of protection or anything?\nMARISHA: I've got my Antilife Shell.\nLAURA: But they're undead. Lovely. Well, first watch. Who's taking it?\nMARISHA: We can all get a good night's sleep, I think, if I tunnel us in and we've got Hallucinatory Terrain.\nLAURA: I still think we should keep watch.\nTRAVIS: Percy's got it, yeah. I'll take second.","response":"DM: So you're all down at the bottom of the tunnel by the roots of the Sun Tree? And you have Hallucinatory Terrained the cellar?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.\nLAURA: I hate that he's asking for clarification.","response":"DM: What?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't 'what?' me.","response":"DM: What's the DC of your spell?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Of Hallucinatory Terrain?","response":"DM: Of all your spellcasting, what's the DC?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's 17. No, 18. But I know they have to make an intelligence save to see through Hallucinatory Terrain.","response":"DM: Correct. If something were interested in doing so."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Exactly, hypothetically.","response":"DM: So who's taking first watch?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Percy.\nSAM: I will watch with him.\nMARISHA: Yeah, Percy can't watch alone.\nTALIESIN: No, that's fine.\nSAM: I'll watch with him.","response":"DM: Okay. It's tight quarters. And you know, other than either a magical light or torch someone wants to put up, there is no light source. It is pitch black down here. What are you guys using as a light source, or are you leaving it pitch dark?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, you can light your little flaming warhammer.\nTRAVIS: Fine. I take the Flaming Warhammer, and I whisper the magic word, bacon. And it turns on fire.\nLAURA: I'm pretty sure he just said bagel.\nMARISHA: Bagel?\nLIAM: While Percival is sleeping, I pull Grog over and we look at him for a while, and I say, where do you think the smoke comes out of?\nTRAVIS: Oh, that's a good question.\nLIAM: Do you think it's the nostrils?\nTRAVIS: No, it looked like it was coming from the bottom up, and there's only two holes down there, so it's either–\nLIAM: Yeah, that's right.\nTRAVIS: Either the dirt button–\nLIAM: It could just be his pores. You're right, it's probably–\nTRAVIS: It's probably the periscope. You're right.","response":"DM: As you guys are having this conversation, the air down here, it's damp earth. It's chilled in the night, anyway, but it's a little warmer because you're under the ground, and it's absorbed some of the heat of the day. But it is getting noticeably colder."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's getting colder?","response":"DM: Yeah, just as the evening progresses. The temperature at night here–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Colder than it did last night? Because it also got pretty cold last night.","response":"DM: Comparable, yeah. There's a low mist begins to form within the tunnel from the temperature."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I wake up my sister.\nLAURA: What, what do you want?\nLIAM: There's fog or something. What's going on?\nTRAVIS: It's just cold.\nLAURA: Can we see if it's magic?","response":"DM: Make an insight check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do that thing again. You can tell when stuff's around.\nLAURA: Oh good, I rolled a one.\nTRAVIS: Can I do a nature check to show them it's just fucking fog?","response":"DM: Yeah, go ahead and roll."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A 13.","response":"DM: Okay. You step forward and take a good long look at the fog that is slowly beginning to form at the base of the tunnel you guys are in. As you lean forward and take it in, the fog begins to form into a physical humanoid essence and reach out for you. For the three that are conscious, roll initiative."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh god!\nLAURA: Shit. It's a teeny tiny tunnel.\nMARISHA: It's another damn ghost wraith thing ghosting in.\nSAM: So what if the Sun Tree is like–\nLAURA: The source of the bad?\nSAM: Yeah.\nLAURA: It's possible it is.\nMARISHA: That's kind of funny.\nLAURA: What if the Briarwoods are right under the Sun Tree, and we're right above them?\nTRAVIS: What if they didn't hang the bodies, the tree just grabbed people?","response":"DM: So Grog back in the fog, Vex is waking up the back, Trinket asleep next to her. Percy, Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Actually, can you move the Wyrmwood box, because all I'm–\nLIAM: Yes, Wyrmwood Gaming, check them out. Beautiful boxes.\nLAURA: You look really good, Matt.\nTRAVIS: 17.\nLAURA: Oh, 22.\nLIAM: 18.","response":"DM: 18. Good to know."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are we spooning?\nTALIESIN: We're sporking.\nSAM: Oh, we are?\nMARISHA: You guys might be sporking.","response":"DM: So Vex, Grog, then you rolled a what?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 18.","response":"DM: Oh, sorry, Vax. Vex, you rolled a–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 22.","response":"DM: 22, right, Grog you were a–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17.","response":"DM: 17, okay. So Grog, this is technically a surprise round on you, then we'll get back to you guys on top of the initiative. You can see now, the mist has formed into a pale humanoid, with two more now that have rolled in. These pale-looking, intensely feral human beings with elongated fangs emerge from this mist and immediately lunge out towards you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are they vampires?\nMARISHA: Can they do that?\nLAURA: They can. They're fucking vampires.\nSAM: No, they can only become bats. I read about this.\nLIAM: (sings) Let's do this.","response":"DM: So, first and foremost, the one that lunges out at Grog is going to shift to the side there. Is going to make a claw attack against you. That is a 20 to hit?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That hits.\nLAURA: Don't forget that we all have our amazing metal around our neck that Scanlan got us.","response":"DM: That's true."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're so intimidating in that costume.","response":"DM: Good. That is a 17 versus armor class."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That misses.","response":"DM: Okay, so it attempts to bite into you, you move out of the way just in time, and that little bit of chain mail, that practically useless piece of chainmail wrapped around your giant thick neck does manage to catch its fangs and deflect the attack initially."}
{"prompt":"LIAM and LAURA: Hey!\nSAM: What, that piece of metal thing? Hey, I made that. I call it a Scanlan. I call everything a Scanlan.\nSAM: And you're a vampire.","response":"DM: And 11 points of necrotic, and your maximum hit points are reduced by 11."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay, really?\nLAURA: Oh no, we haven't had another feast yet.\nSAM: Oh, and the feast is gone too, isn't it?\nMARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: So this third one over here is going to attempt to come after you, Vax, closest to it. That is a 24 to hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, that hits, but I'm going to use Uncanny Dodge.","response":"DM: Okay, to reduce the damage?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, by half.","response":"DM: That's 2d4 slashing against you. Ten points of slashing damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is the half?","response":"DM: Yes, it's going to try to claw you again. That's a 12."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Nope.","response":"DM: Yeah, so the first one slashes across the side of your shoulder, but you manage to pull out of the way just in time to lessen the impact. This, however, sets you up for the easily dodged second blow. You swoop out of the way just barely in time, feeling the wind (whoosh) above your head. That ends their turn. Now we're at the top of the initiative order: surprise round. This would not have been enough noise to wake you guys yet, so you're going to hold on until somebody can get your attention. Top of the round will be Vex."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to say: Wake the fuck up! And I am going to– can I hide? Is that what I do as my bonus?","response":"DM: You have nowhere to hide in this room, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Even if it's super-duper dark?","response":"DM: You get the idea that these creatures probably aren't largely affected by the dark."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That makes perfect sense. I'm going to Hunter's Mark the one that looks the strongest.","response":"DM: Okay. The one that's most visible to you would probably be this one going after your brother. You mark that one."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I am now going to attack him with my blazing bow.\nTRAVIS: Nice! Wyrmwood Box.\nTALIESIN: Breaking in the new box.\nLAURA: That's right.\nLIAM: (sings) It's my dice in a box.\nMARISHA and TALIESIN: Dice in a box, yeah.\nLAURA: I add all of my dice together and then I double it, and then I add the modifier? Okay. And I Hunter's Marked him, yeah.","response":"DM: Yes, you did."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 31.","response":"DM: 31 definitely hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's 31 damage.\nLAURA: The second one was a three. It was a 14 to hit.","response":"DM: No, unfortunately it dodges out of the way. Its reflexes are very quick."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Be honest, the karma will come back to you.","response":"DM: Right, so as you pull back, you release, and with a flash of burning energy, your arrow ignites mid-transit. It blasts and bursts into the vampiric creature, who hisses at you (snarls) through the dark. The second arrow, however, it's completely ready for and actually manages to swipe it out of the air with its clawed hand. Okay, that ends your turn. Next up is Vax."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But I'm looking past his head at the one next to Grog, the one that's got a blade down there on the map. No, the other one. Yeah, I think I've got a pretty good shot at him. I'm going to ignore the vampire in front of me and since Grog is right up against that guy, I'm going to sneak attack him and go (daggers flying) Oh no, first I'm going to go click with my heels, and then I'm going to (daggers flying).\nMARISHA: Click, click. Dagger, dagger, dagger.","response":"DM: Dagger, dagger, dagger! What you got?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: All three hit?","response":"DM: Yeah, the first one was?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I don't remember.\nTALIESIN: 18.","response":"DM: 18. Yeah. They all hit; not a problem."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so the first one is the sneak attack, and that one gets– oh, I should be using the Wyrmwood box. Eight plus 12, 15, 18, 25. 25 for the first one. And for the second dagger that sinks into his head, that is eight. And for the third one that sinks into his fanged fucking face, that is nine.\nLIAM: Yeah, actually I'm going to– no. nope. I'm good.\nTRAVIS: I would like to rage.","response":"DM: Please do."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And I would like to take my Firebrand Warhammer and pound that shit to the left of me twice in the head with my fiery hammer.\nTRAVIS: Oh, yeah. That is a 15.","response":"DM: 15 just barely hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And that's a one.\nLIAM: It's so hard to roleplay tonight.\nTRAVIS: It's so difficult.\nMARISHA: I'm Jimmy Falloning so hard over here.","response":"DM: Yeah, you are. (chuckles)"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 16.\nLIAM: Pull that shit out.\nTRAVIS: Shit. Nine.","response":"DM: Nine. It's pretty well wedged in there right now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Next weapon.\nTRAVIS: Misses.\nTRAVIS: Misses.\nTALIESIN: I'm an 18.","response":"DM: It grabs you by the front of your shirt and lifts you up with that hissing sound. Yeah, that'll be a 25. It pulls you in and sinks its fangs into the side of your throat. You can feel yourself gasp out in pain as the cold sensation pulses through your body, the actual life's blood being drained from you. Okay, you take four points of piercing damage, and you take eight points of necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are reduced by eight."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I forgot I have advantage on strength checks when I'm raging.","response":"DM: Roll again."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A one.\nLAURA: Wow, really?\nTALIESIN: It's as if the gods defy you.\nLIAM: Yeah, that works.\nSAM: Initiative?","response":"DM: Which, for the record Scanlan, as a fan mentioned to me this last week, your jack-of-all-trades ability as a bard that gives you plus two to all things you're not proficient in also adds to your initiative, technically. So you have a plus two to your initiative. I've had this brought up multiple times, if it's not true."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I know it's been brought up to me. I thought it was a hypothetical. Is it true?","response":"DM: It's been clarified by a couple of publications that have been sent to me when I questioned it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What is the bonus for that hat?","response":"DM: We'll consider that hat the plus two bonus."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (chuckles) So I get a plus two. I rolled a 20 initiative, then.","response":"DM: Oh snap. Scanlan next to Vax. Nice."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 12.\nTALIESIN: 22.","response":"DM: Wow."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have really good initiative.\nTALIESIN: I'll go first. I'm going to try and break grapple, obviously, since that's what I have to do.\nLAURA: Can I aid him by shooting him at the same time as he is trying to break the grapple?","response":"DM: You know what? Yes, go ahead and roll your first attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Go for the ear. It's a one.\nTRAVIS: You have the sage, still?\nTALIESIN: It's still at home.\nLAURA: It's been a lot of ones today, man.\nMARISHA: It's only our first hour.\nTALIESIN: Acrobatics!\nLIAM: Let's be clear, that was the shitty plastic die, not the Wyrmwood Box.\nTALIESIN: 28!","response":"DM: 28. You manage to break the grapple."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So that's my action, but if I now spend an action surge, I can get an action?","response":"DM: You can, yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do I get three attacks with the sword I just picked up? Since I'm too close to use my gun right now?","response":"DM: Technically, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to draw the rapier that I just picked and start stabbing at the terrible thing, all the while screaming. (screams)\nLAURA: Is your little butt flap down? Are you in the long johns?\nTALIESIN: The butt flap of my soul is down. I'm well-dressed at the moment.","response":"DM: It's a plus-one rapier. But your archery you took, I think was your combat?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes, so I get a negative two to attack.","response":"DM: Correct, to what you normally get. So you have a overall plus one."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So I get a plus one to attack, on top of my–","response":"DM: No, sorry. Minus one is the total from what you get for your pistols, for your Pepperbox."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Minus one, not minus two. Got it.","response":"DM: The magical rapier offsets that a bit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 25.","response":"DM: 25 hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's a one. Misses.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll a third time."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And that's a 14.","response":"DM: Okay, so the first strike sinks true. That's 1d8 plus what's your strength modifier? Well, no it would be dex."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Dex, thank you! So that's 1d8 plus dex.","response":"DM: Plus one damage on top of that because it's a plus-one weapon."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's a nine.\nTALIESIN: (yells)\nMARISHA: What?","response":"DM: So yeah. You're now considered re-grappled."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (yells)","response":"DM: So you can take another attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'll do my second arrow and try to hit him again because I don't like that I missed.\nTRAVIS: Fucking hit him this time, will you?\nLAURA: I know, right? Don't suck so hard, me.\nLIAM: Come on, don't do that again. You're my sister.\nLAURA: That's better. That definitely hits. It was an 18 plus–","response":"DM: Oh, 18 plus stuff? Yeah. Go ahead and roll damage. This is against the one that's on Percy, still, or the one that's against your brother?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I said it was the one against Percy, even though the other one is Hunter's Marked.\nTALIESIN: Don't sound so upset about it.\nLAURA: Well, I'm just saying.","response":"DM: Too late."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes! 16.\nSAM: Okay, so there's three of these things?","response":"DM: There are three of them, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, I'm going to use my movement– can I see them all?","response":"DM: You can currently, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'll use my movement, because I just woke up, to pee. Because I just woke up, I've got to pee.\nTRAVIS: Do you have morning–\nSAM: It's midnight wood.\nTRAVIS: Okay, so it's probably going to go everywhere.\nLIAM: You're acting like you're botoxed.\nSAM: I can't move my lips.","response":"DM: So Scanlan, you use your movement to pee."}
{"prompt":"SAM: While I'm peeing, I whip out my Wand of Magic Missiles and I point it, and I use four of the slots for it to shoot… four times three is 12 missiles.","response":"DM: Can you do that?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Each slot is one Magic Missile spell, which is three missiles.","response":"DM: I don't know if you can use multiple slots on a turn, can you?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It says so on the wand. “For one charge, you cast the 1st-level spell. You can increase the spell slot level for each additional charge you spend.” So I'm going to use four of them.\nTRAVIS: Like a battleship.\nMARISHA: Like a level-four magic missile.\nSAM: Which is 4d4 plus four for each one that I hit.\nTALIESIN: Like a Rhinestone cowboy.\nLIAM: It's the mustache.\nTRAVIS, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: (sing) Rhinestone cowboy.\nLAURA: Burt Reynolds should play with us more often.\nSAM: This guy is the brains of the operation.\nLIAM: Let me break the fourth wall just for a second to say that this game is totally fucked.","response":"DM: It creates an additional dart per spell level, so it's initially three, and it's three levels higher, it gets to six."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, so it doesn't increase it three darts per level. It's one. So if I do a level four, I get two darts for each fucker.","response":"DM: Essentially, yeah. I'd be 6d4 plus six."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 6d4 plus six. Okay, so 2d4 plus two for each guy. I'll do that.","response":"DM: And they hit automatically. There is no roll for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Great. And it can't hit my friends or anything, right? I mean, they're Magic Missiles.","response":"DM: No, they unerringly hit. They're like homing arcane projectiles."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I have to roll this six times or just two?","response":"DM: Six times. I know."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So, three plus two for the first guy.","response":"DM: Okay, so five against him."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ten for the second guy.\nSAM: And seven for the third guy.\nSAM: By the way, I'm holding my dick with one hand and the wand with the other. I'm dual wielding.\nMARISHA: Dual wielding! Are you proficient in that?\nSAM: And they're both spraying everywhere.","response":"DM: Happy Halloween!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are you writing your name with your left hand?","response":"DM: Okay, so. As you sign your signature on the ground, you also burst forth with a series of arcane bolts that streak across the room, slamming into the sides of each of these vampires. They all look towards you as a reaction to the pain, and their heads all turn curiously as to what they see. Not what they were expecting."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Don't worry, I won't wash my hands.\nSAM: Do I get a bonus?","response":"DM: If you want to use one, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Sure, so I'll inspire Grog. (sings) I need Grog to rage and get us through this semi-fucked kind of fight, baby, baby.\nTRAVIS: Wow, way back.\nSAM: (sings) Kill-kill-kill kill-kill-kill-kill!\nALL: (sing) Kill-kill-kill kill-kill-kill-kill!\nLIAM: Oh, that's so Ravenloft.\nTALIESIN: Wow!","response":"DM: Good night, everybody! And we're done."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Take the inspiration back.\nLIAM: No, I'm not. I'm going to hold for a turn.\nLAURA: Are you really?\nTRAVIS: I want to hammer in the morning, and I want to pull my hammer out of the wall.","response":"DM: Okay, you can use one of your attacks to. Go ahead and make an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yay, that's better. That's a 28.","response":"DM: Yeah you (sucking noise) pull your hammer out without an issue. You're embarrassed at the fact that it was even embedded in what is essentially hard earth, and you still couldn't pull it free. But now it's blazing with flames; it's tight in your grasp. What are you going to follow it up with?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I use the great weapon master on these attacks, and I'll use reckless attack for advantage on them, and anybody that attacks me gets advantage, as well?","response":"DM: Okay. Yes, you can."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Thank god. 21.","response":"DM: 21 hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Beautiful, and the second one. That's landed on the side. That's 24.","response":"DM: Yep, both hit. Go ahead and roll damage plus ten to each."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (sings) Yeah, nipples.","response":"DM: To which one, the one that's next to Percy or the one that's in front of you here?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The one that's next to me!\nTRAVIS: 14 and 15, so 25 for the first one.\nTRAVIS: (sings) Stanky.\n(giggling)\nSAM: Did you just say stanky?\nLAURA: Yeah, he did.\nLIAM: There is no difference between our old home game and this.\nSAM: Except we don't have air conditioning.\nTRAVIS: 29.","response":"DM: 29 damage, jeez. So, the one that's harassing you. Chuckling at the fact that you've currently been unable to really prove your might as a goliath in front of these individuals, you grin as you pull it back and (wham) slam it directly in the face of it. It rears back, (growls) confused for a second. You can see a crack in its jaw and blood beginning to trickle down its jaw. You pull back and slam it a second time, this time with a resounding crack sound, as part of its jaw is dislodged and set to the side, its tongue dangling out, and dark black blood begins to pour from the center of its mouth as it looks to you with absolute fear. That was pretty rough."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah!\nTRAVIS: Nope.\nTRAVIS: Actually, I'll put my back against the wall.","response":"DM: This one?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes. To open it up in case somebody wants to take a shot at him.","response":"DM: Okay. It will get an attack of opportunity on you. Are you cool with that?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes.\nTRAVIS: That hits.\nTRAVIS: Okay.\nLIAM: Right, yeah, I'm good now. So the vampire is still in front of me, right? I give him a look like, yeah, go fuck yourself, and then I keep throwing at the other guy who's with Grog still, right?","response":"DM: No, Grog moved away."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, they do. That's 11 for the first and eight for the second and eight for the third. Right in his vampire guts.","response":"DM: (dagger impacts) You jam the dagger into its torso. It's trying to stop and slap the hands away, but you're too fast and the final hit, you push it up, and you're right in its face again; you can see its fangs still wet with the blood that it pulled from your throat, and you grin at it back as you withdraw the dagger with much force and anger."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And the last thing I say is, vampires ain't shit.\nLIAM: Nah.\nLIAM: So what? So does Scanlan's mustache.","response":"DM: It's true."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I would smile right now if I could.\nTALIESIN: I want to tickle you. See what happens.\nMARISHA: Did I just get seriously boned in initiative? Am I still sleeping?","response":"DM: Yeah, you're last. I mean, you'll be getting up this turn."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm still asleep, guys.","response":"DM: Well, you're awake. You woke up, you're just prone."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well, I'm real groggy.","response":"DM: Real Grog-gy. Sorry, I'm so sorry."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's never going to stop being funny.\nSAM: You're so attractive tonight for some reason. Have we been together?\nTRAVIS: What? Oh, you and I have been together. Did you see?\nSAM: Look at that.\nTRAVIS: I carved that in with a pen, myself, after our night together. Where have you been my whole life?","response":"DM: It's canon."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is our least serious episode ever. We cannot wear costumes but once a year.","response":"DM: Yeah. Only time that it works."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And Purim, also.\nTALIESIN: There will be a pajama night for Christmas.\nALL: Yeah.","response":"DM: Speaking of which. Percy, it's your turn. Oh, I'm sorry, it's their turn on you. There's two of them now, ganging up on you. Natural 20."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How many's left? Three?\nLIAM: They're all still here. They're taking hits.","response":"DM: That's a 20 and a 15."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The 20 hits. The 15 does not.\nTALIESIN: 19 hits.\nMARISHA: Whoa!\nSAM: Not a dream.\nMARISHA: Okay, I thought it was for a second.\nLIAM: Real vampires.\nMARISHA: Okay! What's the situation with the vampires? That's all of them clustered there?","response":"DM: There's two of them right there on Percy. They have him grabbed and shoved against the wall. There's one over here that's battling back and forth with Vax."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Vax? Where is Percy?\nTALIESIN: Against the wall.\nMARISHA: You're against the wall. I get up. Can I reach around Scanlan, doing another reach around–\nSAM: You're doing a reach-around? Okay. My dick is out.\nMARISHA: And I see as I reach around. I'm like, aw, really? And I'm blasting–\nSAM: Little privacy, please?\nMARISHA: I'm blasting a Sunbeam.","response":"DM: At which one?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Those two. It's a line. Are they in a line?","response":"DM: You're probably going to have to move to get them both in a line."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I shift to where I can?","response":"DM: You can move there to do it, yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's what I want to do.","response":"DM: Okay, so you slide alongside Scanlan–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I yell to the party: Shield your eyes!\nSAM: I instinctively cover my penis.\nLIAM: Oh my goodness.\nSAM: It's more important than my eyes.\nTRAVIS: Take my eyes, not my penis.\nLIAM: It's the third one.","response":"DM: Yeah, no, you were technically in melee with this guy, but there is no attack roll, so you don't have disadvantage, which is good."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Awesome.\nMARISHA: I roll a bunch of d6s?","response":"DM: Well, yeah, go ahead and do that. Each creature has to make a constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How many d6s do I roll?\nMARISHA: Full damage. Okay, so that is 15, 19. Not bad. 21 plus 12, so that's 33 radiant damage, and they are blinded.\nSAM: What? Is that true?","response":"DM: Okay, well. (chuckles)"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Where I can also not look at Scanlan's penis.","response":"DM: Right, you feel the inspiration, based on the presence of the Sun Tree, and what previously you were attempting to try and repair it with. Using that, you close your eyes and a burst of sunlight energy cascades forth, slamming into both the vampires and barely missing Percy in the process. Both of them look over out of the corner of their eye as they see the flash of light. They both scream out (screeches) as the blast shoots through both of them. Both of them immediately  turn to ash and are strewn against the far wall."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Whoa! Damn!\nSAM: That was so cool.\nMARISHA: That was cool.\nSAM: Zip.\nTRAVIS: Bonus action.\nMARISHA: So there is one alive?","response":"DM: There is one alive, yes, that's right next to you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And he's on Vax?","response":"DM: Currently, yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I see that. I turn and I see him, and I'm gonna take a Grasping Vine and wrap around it and yank him, trying to beat him up against the wall on the other side.","response":"DM: This side here?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yep.","response":"DM: Okay, is it a bonus action for Grasping Vine?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes, it is.","response":"DM: What's the roll for that? I'm looking for the roll for Grasping Vine real fast."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I conjure a vine– I think it just happens.","response":"DM: Dexterity saving throw. With the DC, it's 17."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Nope, 18.","response":"DM: 18. No, that gets it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should probably use sunlight on them always, because don't they turn into mist if we don't kill them?\nMARISHA: Yeah, I think so.\nLAURA: I don't know, should we attack him or should we let–\nTRAVIS: Stake.\nLAURA: Oh yeah. I bust out one of the wooden daggers. I walk up and I try to stab it into his heart. In front of my brother.\nMARISHA: Nice! Wood dagger!\nLAURA: Okay, I still get two attacks, right?","response":"DM: Correct. And you're using your dexterity as the bonus. Simple weapon, which you're proficient with."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 19?","response":"DM: That is a 19? Does hit, yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, then what do I do?","response":"DM: Roll for second attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Probably no. 14.\nLAURA: Nine?\nLAURA: Wooden stakes don't work! I back up a little bit.\nSAM: You got some damage in, no? Yes?\nThat stake was well done. Yeah!\nTRAVIS: That was so CSI Miami, man.\nLIAM: Your mustache is almost down to your chin for a goatee.\nSAM: Soon it will be creeping across my face.\nLAURA: I guess so.","response":"DM: Yeah, that was two attacks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I move away, since he's grappled?","response":"DM: Well, he's not currently grappled per se; he's just held against the wall. You can still move away if you want. It'll just take a swipe at you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to stay right there.\nLAURA: Thanks, Trinket.","response":"DM: Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is it true that we can't kill it except with sunlight?\nLAURA: Sunlight and water.","response":"DM: You're not entirely certain. You know that sunlight is very damaging to it, and from your research, you know that vampires of certain levels of power, as opposed to dying, turn into a mist form and attempt to retreat."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: They misted in.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to hack at his neck with my sword a couple of times.\nMARISHA: I wrote all that stuff down.\nTALIESIN: 28.","response":"DM: 28 hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 22.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 22.\nTALIESIN: Ten points, 15 points.\nTALIESIN: Ten points.\nTALIESIN: I'll back away from it.","response":"DM: Okay, so you're back there. As you back away, it sees the opportunity and reaches out with its claws towards you. That is a nine."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That does not hit. I'm going to really quickly also do a second wind.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should we ask it questions or something?\nSAM: Does it talk?\nTALIESIN: I think we should probably just kill it.\nLAURA: Okay.\nSAM: I'm up? I'm not ready. I guess I don't need to see it. Can I see it?","response":"DM: Yeah, it's right here. You're right there."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Can I do this? I will just taunt it. I will use Vicious Mockery on it, and I'll just say: What's up? What's up, toothy? Hey, bite me. That's it. That's all I do.","response":"DM: (chuckles) Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's 3d4.","response":"DM: Yeah, it is. That was about 3d4 worth."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's all I got. I wasn't ready.\nTRAVIS: What's up, toothy? Bite me.\nSAM: I think it's a wisdom.","response":"DM: There we go. Yeah, it's a wisdom saving throw. No, it does not make it with a six."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Because I'm a level 11.","response":"DM: It's 3d4 damage. It does take it and it has disadvantage on its next attack roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I do it at an even higher level?","response":"DM: No, I was thinking of another spell. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Four, two, two. Eight!","response":"DM: Eight points of damage. How do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: That's how I want to do it. I want to do some pelvic thrusting while I'm saying it: Bite me. Bite me hard. Bite me, motherfucker, bite me!\nTALIESIN: Urine flying everywhere.\nSAM: Oh shit, I forgot. Oh, there's urine everywhere. My mustache is falling off; it's terrible.","response":"DM: So as it's trying to take its chances, it turns to go ahead and flee. Sees Grog, looks over and hears you going: “Hey, toothy!” Looks over back at you. One of the weaknesses of a vampire is running water. Technically, it needs to be a large amount of running water, but this creature is on death's door and based on the fact that it is right on the edge of passing out, anyway, the bit of your–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Constellation Urine.","response":"DM: Yes, streaks across the front of the vampire as it turns around. Grog just instinctually slams it with the hammer and smashes it into the ground. It's hard to say which killed it, but you're pretty sure it was you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good job, Scanlan!\nSAM: High five! (impact sound)\nTRAVIS: Chest bump! (impact sound)","response":"DM: Which, for the record, as you high five him, there is a bit of spatter across your hand."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Future reference, the fog is bad. Not totally natural.\nLIAM: Oh, there is no gnome like our gnome. Oh my gods.\nLAURA: Seriously, though, put your dick away.\nSAM: I'm sorry. You're right, I'm sorry. Please don't judge me. It's morning, it's also unseasonably cold in here. That's why it's so small. Don't judge me.\nTRAVIS: So newsflash: the fog is bad. We probably need a new hideout.\nLAURA: We probably gave away our location.\nTRAVIS: Nope, no, we killed them all.\nLIAM: He just rolled a die.\nLAURA: We should probably get the fuck out.\nMARISHA: What time is it, midnight?","response":"DM: Right now it's a little after midnight."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So we have not had a full rest?\nTALIESIN: Let's have a full rest.\nLAURA: Really?\nTALIESIN: They don't know where we are yet. We killed everybody.\nSAM: What if they have some sort of psychic communication, and what if this is their spawning ground? What if the Sun Tree is their spawning ground?\nMARISHA: Can I do some sort of check to see if the Sun Tree is their spawning ground?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make an intelligence check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just a straight intelligence check?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. That's a natural one.\nLAURA: Yay. Hey, that's what I rolled when I was trying to check things out.","response":"DM: It's hard to say. You don't understand a lot of the nature of undead; it's not your forte and things have been weird around here. You have no idea."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Here's what we're going to do. I've got one silver piece right here. I'm going to flip it.\nSAM: Wait. Did you grow that mustache for tonight?\nLAURA: Yes.\nSAM: That's awesome.\nLIAM: It was a goatee a scant five hours ago. Now it is an Errol Flynn mustache. Thank you. We'll discuss it at break. I'm going to flip this coin because that's all we fucking got. If it's a 20, we're gonna stay here. If it's a one, we're going to find another place.\nMARISHA: Sure, fuck it. Leave it up to chance.\nLAURA: We find another place.\nTALIESIN: Can we tunnel our way to the tree?\nLAURA: Let's tunnel. I don't want to go up. No, we can't tunnel\nMARISHA: I can't. I blew all my natural energies doing that Sunbeam.\nLIAM: It's still night, though. We've had a short rest. We've got to get out of here. They know we're here.\nLAURA: It's night. We can't travel at night.\nTRAVIS: I know.\nLIAM: You're a badass.\nLAURA: There's vampires.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we step outside, it's game on.\nLIAM: As opposed to down here in the hole?\nLAURA: I feel like we're safer down here. At least there's only so many places they can attack from.\nSAM: But the coin said we should go.\nLIAM: That's fine. When you went down that cavern that one time, that worked out really well. So let's do what she says.\nMARISHA: Wait, are you talking about when Vex and I came back with Clarota and he helped us for quite a while? Is that what you're talking about?\nLAURA: That worked out really well because we probably wouldn't have defeated K'Varn without him.\nMARISHA: Yeah, you're right, Vax. Vex, let's stay.\nLIAM: That's very open to interpretation.\nTRAVIS: Until he betrayed us and tried to eat Scanlan's brain.\nTALIESIN: I'm agreeing with the women because I want to live to see the morning.\nSAM: I still think Clarota was a pretty good guy.\nTRAVIS: We decide to stay.\nTRAVIS: We stay.\nLAURA: We're stupid.\nTRAVIS: No we're not. We'll be fine.\nLAURA: What if we went up above ground and went into the second floor? So we're not underground.\nMARISHA: Are there two stories? I technically used my Hallucinatory Terrain spell to make it look like a one-story tavern.\nSAM: What about this? How about we don't sleep in the tunnel? We barricade that up and we just sleep in the cellar. Not the tunnel, the cellar.\nLIAM: Back and to the left.\nSAM: Can we barricade the cellar somehow?\nMARISHA: That I can do. I'll do a Wall of Stone where I tunneled.\nLAURA: We're very packed in. It's nice and cozy and warm.","response":"DM: It is, and you're surrounded by a number of bottles of wine–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And bear farts.\nTALIESIN: And all the wine we stole. We stole a lot of wine.\nMARISHA: Can we pop open a bottle of that wine?\nTALIESIN: And try and relax?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we can. I guess I'll allow it.","response":"DM: Pop open the wine, share a bottle, and you all manage to find your way back to sleep. Who's taking watch now?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'll go with Vax because I haven't been yet.","response":"DM: Okay, so you two take the next watch."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I stay awake because I don't want them to be alone.\nMARISHA: Half-elves, what what.\nSAM: I go back to sleep.\nTRAVIS: Half-elves, what what.\nLIAM: Hello, my half-elven brothers.\nLIAM: (shushing noises) Jeralt is speaking.","response":"DM: It's Geralt, thank you very much."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sigil.\nLIAM: I haven't played that game, but is your name Solid Snake?","response":"DM: I will attack both of you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Cue internet rage.\nSAM: I've already watched.\nLAURA: I need to sleep. You need to sleep.\nTRAVIS: Fuck it, I'll do it.\nLAURA: Trinket stays awake with you, though.","response":"DM: And Trinket does like staying awake with you, Grog. You both understand each other on a very feral and unintelligent level."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We play hand slaps. (impact sound) Fuck. Claws catching every once in a while.","response":"DM: Eventually, everyone's managed to gather your evening's rest. You come to consciousness, the cold morning greets you. No seeming further incident in the cellar during the evening."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You're welcome.","response":"DM: I would like everyone to make a wisdom saving throw, please."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No problem.\nTALIESIN: Wisdom saving or just wisdom?","response":"DM: Wisdom saving throw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Saving throw? Oh right, because we've been in a cursed land for a while.\nSAM: Does my thing help me?","response":"DM: Your thing help you?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I have some thing.\nLIAM: The cube?\nMARISHA: Jack-of-all-trades?\nSAM: No, shit. I'll find it. Don't worry, come back to me.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 17.\nLAURA: 17.\nTRAVIS: 11.\nSAM: What is this? Wisdom?","response":"DM: Wisdom saving throw."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no, how many can you get before you're totally evil?\nMARISHA: What does that mean? Now what?","response":"DM: Tell you in a second."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Am I still coughing?","response":"DM: Oh, you're still coughing. You guys all come back to consciousness. Cold morning greets you. Food probably is going to be in order pretty soon. You guys didn't get much of a meal the evening before, and you're all still a little sore after your evening's rest. You've pushed through and recovered from your exhaustion from your frenzied rage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Thank you.\nSAM: Ring of Mind-Shielding, is what I was going to say.\nTALIESIN: That mustache is getting very iffy.\nSAM: I don't know what you're talking about.\nTRAVIS: Do we want some dried food rations?\nLAURA: Plus, there's probably dried food in this cellar.\nTRAVIS: I have a ton in the bag.\nMARISHA: Can we do a check to see if there's any jerky or anything in the cellar? Did we already do that?\nSAM: Whoa, that's so cool. I mean terrible.\nLAURA: Is he the only one that was affected this time, again?","response":"DM: Yep. Everyone else rolled above a ten."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have a very low wisdom, and I rolled really badly.\nTRAVIS: I have a question. My 11 points of permanently lowered hit points from the necrotic damage, can that be healed with a potion of greater healing?","response":"DM: Those hit points have all come back, by the way, guys. Over the night, the hit points you lost on your hit point total have been returned."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I didn't suffer from this, but permanently lowered health?","response":"DM: Yeah, from the bite? That recovers after a long rest."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Literally what I just asked.\nSAM: What about the hit points that were lowered?\nTRAVIS: Literally what I just asked.\nTRAVIS: Are we going to find another house to kill now? I mean, to carefully investigate and thoroughly due diligence the heads before we smash them.\nLIAM: Scanlan, I think you and I going to go see how people are feeling in the town while everybody else looks for a new hidey-hole, yeah?\nMARISHA: Are we tunneling through this entire city?\nLIAM: I think you are, but if it's first thing in the morning, I don't think the Briarwoods could have gotten to everybody yet, so I think you and I could do our father-son act for like an hour.\nSAM: Did you just say fart the son act?\nLIAM: Fart the son and the vampires, they're done– father and son.\nSAM: Oh, father and son. Oh! Seeming!\nLIAM: Because you're little, and I'm tall.\nSAM: Yes.\nTALIESIN: Why don't we Seem all of us so we can go take a look around while you talk to–\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to find a different spot.\nLIAM: Quickly, though, because even though we don't look like ourselves, they know that there are strangers in town.\nLAURA: Grog, give everybody a little bit of the Dust of Tracelessness.\nTALIESIN: And we have the earpieces.\nSAM: Do we? Do you?\nTALIESIN: I have one now.\nMARISHA: I have one.\nLIAM: I have one.\nSAM: Okay. So I am to Seem us as peasants again?\nLAURA: Yes.\nLIAM: Same peasants, yes.\nTRAVIS: Different-looking peasants.\nSAM: (sings) Seeming.

It's dangerous.\nMARISHA: Okay. I like that plan.\nTRAVIS: What's the safety word?\nSAM: I'd leave that up to Percy.\nMARISHA: I was going to say I'd leave that up to you.\nLAURA: Meet back here in two hours–\nLIAM: Too long.\nLAURA: Hold on. Meet back here in two hours if we haven't heard from everything.\nTALIESIN: If everything goes wrong, we meet back here in two hours. Otherwise, check in every 30 minutes. Do we need a code word?\nSAM: Yeah, we need a code word.\nTRAVIS: Doritos.\nLAURA: I was thinking Dorito, too! How weird.\nTRAVIS: Married.\nMARISHA: Dorito. I like that.\nMARISHA: Hot. I might have to de-armor.\nTRAVIS: I'm taking this wig off.","response":"DM: See you guys shortly."}

You and I, we're going to go talk to people.\nSAM: Papa, let's go.\nLAURA: Keyleth, you and me.\nTALIESIN: No, the four of us are sticking together, I thought.\nTALIESIN: Trinket the donkey.\nSAM: Oh, yes.\nTALIESIN: We'll go to the Alcove.\nTRAVIS: We're going to the Alcove.","response":"DM: Good. So."}

No. You have already transformed everybody into the original–"}

And I swat him as hard as I can in the back of the head.\nSAM: Thenardier is our precious father.","response":"DM: The four of you head off towards the Alcove. Heading out into the day, the cloud cover is pretty thick. There is just general moisture and mist to the air. It probably could rain any second. You continue moving towards the northwestern side of the town. You do notice, in comparison to previous days, there is a little more energy to the streets. People seem to be moving back and forth with hustle and business. You do also see, as you head on your way out, there is still a slight bit of smoke slowly swimming up from the house in the distance, and what minor embers were not put out by the rainfall, it's just a little trace of smoke."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Was it the north, the east, or the west manor?","response":"DM: That was the eastern."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Eastern manor.","response":"DM: Yeah, that one is partially burned down. So as you continue heading northwest, you eventually make your way to where you recall the Alcove was. Now, when you get there, it's a relatively plain-looking building. Dark woods. There's a sign out front that says The Alcove. It's old. The metal that holds the sign has rusted a bit. The doors are open, and as you push into the building, it's largely empty and seemingly unkempt, compared to the previous oddity shops you've been to. Many books about enchantment look left out on one of the nearby tables, partially read and abandoned as if they were being flipped through. And then as you look across the room, behind the counter, there's a young girl in her late teens, a blonde waif of a girl, who's currently thumbing through a book and notices you guys enter. “Oh! Hi. Can I help you?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes, we're looking to buy a few things, and we were wondering– actually, I used to do business with Simon. Is Simon around?","response":"DM: “Simon was called away for a special project by the Briarwoods about six months ago. He told me to look over the store while he's gone. I'm sorry, we're mostly out of stock. We don't have much here at the moment.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: He was called away on a special project? What sort of special project?","response":"DM: “I don't know. He lives in the castle now. I mean, he would visit every week or so, but he hasn't been back in almost a month, and I'm a little worried.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He lives at the castle?\nTALIESIN: He lives at the castle? Oh.\nMARISHA: Did he ever tell you about any details of this special assignment?","response":"DM: “No, unfortunately. He was the real enchanter here. I'm just trying to do my best to learn what I can while he's gone.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Speak up, girl! I can't hear you.","response":"DM: “I'm sorry, miss! I'm sorry. I'm Jordana Whisk. I'm Simon's daughter.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Simon's daughter. Now, did he like the Briarwoods?","response":"DM: She gives you a look and looks about the room for a moment. “The Briarwoods have been very fair and just rulers of this land.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm trying to look straight at her, but I'm really looking that direction and over there.","response":"DM: She's gathered as much and is seemingly offput by the whole presentation. “The Briarwoods are just and fair, and we should not speak ill of them in public.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can somebody see if there's something watching?\nMARISHA: Yeah, can I do a perception check around the room and see if there's any indications that the Briarwoods might have–\nTRAVIS: Monitoring?\nMARISHA: Yeah, a bug? Like some sort of something where they might be monitoring this place.\nSAM: A small electronic device.\nMARISHA: Yes. That kind of bug.","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Not bad. 26.","response":"DM: Looking around the room, there doesn't appear to be any specific devices installed, whether magical or otherwise, that would pertain to immediate–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No blue poo. Got it.\nLAURA: (whispering) Lean in, girl. Lean in.","response":"DM: She leans in a little bit and goes, “Hold on.” And she runs off behind the counter. Heads back and closes the doors behind where you guys entered. Heads back and gets behind the counter. “I'm sorry. I don't recognize any of you, and you're bringing up rather dangerous statements. What can I help you with? We don't have much.” And she reaches down and pulls out a couple of small glass vials. Simple healing potions, you can already see. You've worked with these type of things before."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're actually looking for something a bit more complicated and a little more dangerous.","response":"DM: She pulls up a small metal rod. “One of these?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I don't know what that is. Let me show you. And I'm going to walk over to the wall, find a dusty wall, and I'm going to trace the symbol on the wall.","response":"DM: Okay. She gives you a look and says, “It's dangerous to draw that around here, sir.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to wipe it away.","response":"DM: She gets a little more comfortable as soon as you do. “What are you doing here?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're hoping that we could purchase a brief amount of sanctuary.","response":"DM: “Here? Why?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We need to keep moving so that they don't catch us.","response":"DM: “The Briarwoods are after you? I can't have you here! You'll bring them right to me!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Dear, the Briarwoods aren't after us. They're after everybody. What we need is a place to stay that we know is protected.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (growls) Eight is– 16.\nSAM: 80 60?\nLAURA: 80 60.","response":"DM: Yes, big number. It's a very large die."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Can I try and pour on top of it?","response":"DM: I'd say no. Not at this point. You're the one that originally spurred her worry. She gives you a look. “Look, if I'm going to let you stay here, I need to know more about what it is that you're trying to accomplish here. Raising the symbol of the de Rolos? I've never seen any of you in the city before in my life.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do you miss the de Rolos, dear?","response":"DM: “Anything's better than this misery.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, we may know a couple de Rolos. We may know some. No big deal.\nMARISHA: It's true.","response":"DM: She shakes her head and, “Foolish minds. The de Rolos have been dead for five years.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Not all of them.","response":"DM: “Really?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I can't drop the Seeming, can I?\nTRAVIS: Just drop that phat name of yours, buddy.\nLAURA: Only one person would know the entire name of Percival de Rolo.\nMARISHA: Miss, do you know the full name of Percival de Rolo?\nTALIESIN: I was wondering if you were about to do it. Can you do it?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, it's Museldorf Musketeers–\nSAM: Percival Sanchez Vicario–\nLAURA: de Rolo III.\nLIAM: The Nina, the Pinta, the Santa Maria.\nMARISHA: Percival Von Musel Von Lichtenstein de Rolo III.\nSAM: Kevin Dorff, Wesley Snipes.\nLAURA: Magneto de Rolo III.\nMARISHA: de Rolo III.","response":"DM: This moment of tension with Jordana awkwardly staring at these all very intently looking dirty peasants. With a donkey. Just talking about names."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Simon Whisk was a good friend to Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.\nMARISHA: That's it.\nTALIESIN: Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.\nMARISHA: Percival Fredricks Von Stein–\nTRAVIS: You can call him Percy.\nTALIESIN: Percival lives, and he's coming.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"[no audio]","response":"DM: And one you're not sure the nature of, and says, “Take these.” And she pushes them ahead to you. “It's not much.” Two regular healing potions, one greater healing potion. She explains what the metal thing is. She picks it up and clicks part of the metal cusp of it, and it stays in the air on its own."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh my god! It's another Rod of Holding.","response":"DM: Immovable Rod, but yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Immovable Rod. That one. I was combining Bag of Holding and the Immovable Rod. Combining them.\nSAM: What's a movable rod?\nLAURA: Two greater healing and then another regular?","response":"DM: One greater healing and two regular."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's like a ladder rung that you can put wherever you want and hang on it.\nSAM: Did we already have one of those?\nMARISHA: Yeah, we did.\nSAM: What happened to it?\nMARISHA: Tiberius put it somewhere, and it never came back.\nSAM: He put it on the magic carpet?\nMARISHA: He might have. Tiberius had one. We didn't use it much.\nLIAM: He's a mysterious motherfucker.\nMARISHA: I'll take the rod.\nTALIESIN: I will make sure that you are compensated when this is over. Can we sleep here for the night?","response":"DM: “Follow me.” She leads you to the back, and there's this very, very small room that looks like it used to be her father's room. It's dusty. Most of it has been untouched, except for the bed. She walks in. “This is all I have to offer. It's not much, but it's available.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it safe at night?","response":"DM: “As safe as anything is here. Just don't go outside.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What does the ceiling look like?","response":"DM: It's about nine feet up. Maybe about two feet of rafters. Very simple. Very plain."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's where we need to be tonight. Remember when we were in the branches?\nLAURA: Can I insight check her and see if she seems to be truthful?","response":"DM: Sure, go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I never know which one. It's too much pressure to choose. That was the wrong one. I chose poorly. 13.","response":"DM: Okay. It's hard to tell. She's young, and she seems definitely earnest and plain with her forthrightness. Yeah, there doesn't appear to be any sort of deception."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We are allies. With us comes change. Keep our secret and all the better we'll be for it.","response":"DM: “It's kept, but I recommend talking to Keeper Yennen if you haven't. He's one of the social centerpieces of the remaining good folk in the city.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We have spoken to him. We will speak to him again today.","response":"DM: His reach is far. He'd be the one to talk to. Well, don't stay here long. That will draw attention."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Also, we're going to have two more staying with us, if that's okay.\nLAURA: One's a child, though. You won't even notice him.\nTALIESIN: Good day. Everyone, let's meet over at the Lady's Chamber once you're finished with your business.\nLIAM: I'm dragging you along by the scruff of the ear.\nSAM: Pa, please!\nLIAM: Shut up.\nSAM: I'm tired.\nLIAM: I'm going to look for anybody walking by. Is there anyone nearby?","response":"DM: After about a minute or so of walking, you do see what looks to be a young man carrying a satchel over his shoulder. It looks like it's filled with a few small pieces of parchment that are rolled up. He's in a brisk walk somewhere."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I walk right up to him and I awkwardly put a hand on his chest, and I make sure that I flip my pencil and spit as I talk and say, I need a hard drink. I need a hard drink right now. Where?","response":"DM: “If you're looking for a drink,” And he points over down the road, and he's really put off by it and is trying to keep his face out of your breath. “You're going to look for the Journey's End. Two blocks down that way, to the right. It's not much business during the day.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I spit at his feet and I pull Scanlan by the ear. Come on, you shit.\nSAM: (yelps) Call Child Protective Services!","response":"DM: As you walk away, you hear him mutter under his breath, “What's this world coming to?” And he continues on his brusque pace."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm following his directions and going there. Journey's End, yeah.","response":"DM: You are now at the Journey's End tavern. It's pretty barren. You walk inside. There are two employees. One who is behind the bar and is currently reading through a book. The second is currently pouring a drink for the one patron that's in there, what looks to be a slovenly looking gentleman who's sitting at a table drinking his woes away. He's currently going through what looks like a ledger of some kind, and there's a tavern employee with an apron on. He's this younger, red-headed boy, who's trying to fill a flagon while this gentleman at the table is cursing at him to the side. Other than that, it's empty."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Empty. So how many in here?","response":"DM: Three."}
{"prompt":"SAM: My name is Tad.\nLIAM: Shut up! Your mother's going to kill us both. (sighs) Two! Two here, and a water for him.\nSAM: I'll have one of what he's having, as well.","response":"DM: (chuckles) “That's cute. Water it is.” And he's walking off."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I swat him in the back of the head for the bartender to see.","response":"DM: The patron now, a closer look: man in his late forties. Has a protruded jawline, little bit of an underbite. Thinning brown hair, and he's got some smears of dirt on his face. Looks like he's been crying, and is slumped over the table, looking over this ledger. He slams it shut as you sit down with a very, very loud (impact noise). Glances sidelong towards you and says, “What the fuck are you doing coming and bothering a man in the middle of his meal?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Can't fucking earn a living in this land. Come up from a mile out of town, been trying to grow fucking carrots for these fucking people. Can't earn a living!","response":"DM: “You're telling me. Ain't no living to be had in Whitestone these days. It's nothing but misery.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Something's got to change here. I can't live. I can't give them what they want. I can't feed him. What are we fucking supposed to do here?\nSAM: I haven't eaten in three days.","response":"DM: “That's the worst fucking part, is you know there's always an easy exit.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What?","response":"DM: “What, you think the folks who've taken their life to this point? You think that's the end, but no, not in this town. No, they just get right back up the next day. There is no way out.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The fuck are you talking about?","response":"DM: “Talking about the whole business. There is no escaping this misery. Either you try and stay alive and exist in this bullshit, or you die and become one of them. I've been trying to find a way out of this city for months now, but they're always watching.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I take a huge drink of the mug in front of me. (sighs) Someone should run these fuckers out of town.","response":"DM: “That ain't going to happen, mate. Sorry.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I have a friend named Kevin. He says there is someone trying to do something about it. He says that that's what caused that fire yesterday, over at that big fancy house. He says there's rebels afoot!\nLIAM: I take the mug that I have, and I pour the rest of it out on this little one's head and say, you speak when you're spoken to.","response":"DM: “No, it's okay. Let the boy speak. Let your boy speak! What were you saying?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I'm just saying what I overheard. My friend Kevin, he's truthful. When he lies, his papa beats him, so I believe him. He said that someone really strong took out someone who was at that big fancy house that was all aflame the other day. He said that there's lots of them, and that they're going to free us all from this hell we live in!\nSAM: Wait, two rolls?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It was that good.\nSAM: Okay, persuasion and deception, you say. Oh Jesus. Okay, persuasion. 39.\nTALIESIN: What?!\nLAURA: How?! Is that even possible?\nSAM: Deception, 15. Wait, or 29. It's a lot.","response":"DM: What's your bonus?!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, it's 16 plus 13.","response":"DM: Okay, so 29."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That's 29. Sorry. It's a lot.\nLIAM: I start fake-weeping into my cup.","response":"DM: He goes, “Oh no. No need for that. Going to make me lose my appetite. Hate the sound of a grown man crying. Chin up!” And he takes and flicks a coin at your face."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ow, fuck!","response":"DM: “Look, if what he's saying's true, and we've got some sort of savior making their way into town, well. Let's hope they're at least a little more prepared than the last ones.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: The last ones?","response":"DM: “The uprising three years ago. Are you new to this fucking town?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Three years ago, Papa wouldn't let me out of the closet, so I didn't hear much of what was going on.","response":"DM: “Okay, first and foremost, you've got to treat your boy better. Going to raise someone no better than the motherfuckers running Whitestone right now if you keep this up.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (retches)\nLAURA: Did you really puke, or did you fake puke?\nSAM: I'm sorry about my papa. He's had such a hard time these last few years. Our crops are not performing well, and he's under a lot of pressure. And I think Mama doesn't love him anymore. I'm sorry. We can go.","response":"DM: “I think you should. But one thing: if he ever does anything else to hurt you again, you come tell someone. Two: if you hear anything else about this savior coming into town, go ahead and talk to Trevor over there, at the edge of the bar.” And you see over there, there's the guy who's behind the bar with his book. He doesn't even notice all this happening. Guy in his mid-thirties, glasses at the end of his nose, his hair's slicked back and pulled into a taut ponytail, and he's sitting there reading. And he says, “Go ahead and tell Trevor, because the rest of us would like to go out in a blaze of glory than live in this bullshit.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What was your name, sir?","response":"DM: “Not important to much, but you can call me Patrick.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thank you, Patrick. I don't know if my papa has enough money for these drinks.\nLIAM: I'm going to insight check Patrick.\nSAM: From the floor?","response":"DM: He's listening in. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Come on, Papa. Let's go. I turn around and I take the rest of his drink.\nLIAM: And as he pulls me away, and I slovenly turn after him. I turn back for a second, and I completely sober up. Pelor has returned. Walked out.\nMARISHA: Let's not make ourselves known. I want to see this. I want to hear what's up.\nTALIESIN: Sit in the back.","response":"DM: Okay, sit in the back. He begins talking for a while about a long tangent, speaking of, “This land, once cherished, is a burning light and a beacon of good existence, of kinship, of honesty and loyalty, dragged down to the muck by the imposition of darkness, the return of the evil that once scourged this land. Now given new faces, they push us down, and as hope crumbles, the light peeks through once again, for whispers have come to my ears, friends, that this unrest now has a name. I'm sure you've seen it, the fire atop that building this morning, watched as one of your oppressors was cut from his high throne. One of his close advisors scarred, tortured, shown the strength of this hidden ally of us, the oppressed peoples of Whitestone.” And he looks up over the group a little bit and past the streets, carefully. “I have come to believe that perhaps this is the time for us to band together and show our support. Now, the information is still vague, but just keep your eyes open. Be careful, be quiet. As things progress, word will find you.” Bows his head and says a prayer that– none of you speak  Celestial?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I do.\nSAM: You do?!\nTALIESIN: I speak Celestial.\nLAURA: I want to watch people as they walk away and try to read their lips as they're walking away to see if everybody seems loyal to what he said, or if anybody seems a little–","response":"DM: Everyone is silent. Everyone is quiet, and everyone is looking warily and making their own separate paced exits, so as not to draw attention."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we try to memorize their faces? Of everybody that was here?","response":"DM: Okay. You keep as best a mental image of everyone who's passing by. Not too many notable folk. They look like, especially where you're from, the peasantry doesn't really interest you visually, but you do manage to gather details of certain scars here and there, and people, hair color, age, stuff like that."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Did we recognize the guy that was talking?\nLAURA: Yeah, that was Keeper.","response":"DM: Keeper Yennen."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, we gathered again. Okay.","response":"DM: You recognize two of the individuals at this were the farmers you initially saw on the outskirts of Whitestone when you did your little scouting mission earlier."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, nice. When we flew in?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.","response":"DM: So from all the people you've encountered, those are the only two that you specifically recognize so far, but it does appear to be made up of–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Working hands, farmers.","response":"DM: Yeah, the foundation of this city that have been so long oppressed."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I elbow Percy, and I go, do we talk to him?\nTALIESIN: I think we do. Maybe he talks to us. I try and catch his attention.","response":"DM: Okay. You can see as he begins putting out some of the incense, he looks over and sees, “Ah, yes. You've returned. Please, follow me.” And he steps outside of the amphitheater and around the back of it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We follow.","response":"DM: Okay. Around the back of the amphitheater, you see there is constructed, attached to the very far end of this round half-dome, a square brick building. Very simple. And as he ushers you all inside, it's essentially a tea room. There's a table, there's a tea set up there, there is a small stove in the far end with a little fire-burning stove, and shelves and shelves and shelves arranged with all different manner of small sculptures, metalwork, holy symbols of Erathis that have all been put on display. Each one has a name carved beneath it. And you recognize this, Percy. This is the legacy of all the Keepers of the Lady's Chamber over time, their symbols. This is basically a Hall of Previous Keepers. “Please, sit. Have tea if you like, if you're so interested. We have much to discuss. So. I am to believe that these allies you spoke of previously were responsible for this dastardly attack on Sir Kerrion?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That could be inferred.","response":"DM: “Well, I have spoken privately with a number of the remaining community leaders of our town, and they are unconvinced. Understand, this isn't the first time an insurrection has been attempted, and much sorrow was endured after previous failures. We keep hope best we can, but without a solid plan, we are sending the rest of our able-bodied into the abyss.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What happened last time?","response":"DM: “Well, in a similar fashion, we had a number of fed-up individuals decide to finally raise some sort of aggressive act against the castle and attempt to storm it by force. We figured we had the numbers. There are many dangers in that castle that go beyond what we were prepared for. As such, the few that survived, well. They met the fate most do at the Sun Tree these days. So we've been remiss to put ourselves in a similar position for many years now. To make matters worse, our informant within the castle has gone silent these past few weeks. We have no idea of the progression of the Briarwoods' plot.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Was your informant by chance named Simon?","response":"DM: “No. Simon has been missing for some time, actually.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Who was your informant?","response":"DM: “I don't know the name. The information comes through– actually, he should be arriving here in just a moment.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What did they find underneath Whitestone?","response":"DM: “All that we know is they've been rebuilding or repurposing something old and terrible beneath the city. I've only heard whispers of it referred to as the ziggurat.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA, TRAVIS, and MARISHA: The ziggurat.","response":"DM: “Now, to go into the deep history of this city, as you are outsiders, legend speaks of a seed, that the Sun Tree was placed by Pelor himself to seal a wound in the light. Whitestone rose around it. The fable has long been told, but ever since those fiends took the city, their interest beneath the city has kept me thinking on this fable. Leaves me very unsettled. And as the Sun Tree slowly died, so did our confidence. Further–” At which point, the door across the room opens. (creak) And another enters the room. A very elderly man steps in, his ragged robes draped on his very thin, frail form."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I wink at him.","response":"DM: His weathered skin is dark and leathery. He's nearly hairless on his head and has liver spots all over his scalp. One of his eyes is clouded over and white. He shimmies in very slowly. “I ask you strangers, what makes you so sure you can change the tide of this battle?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (whispers) Drop Seeming. Drop it.\nTALIESIN: Do I recognize this person?","response":"DM: As old as he may be, there is a subtle power and resonance and confidence to his voice. There's a force of personality and conviction that immediately leads you to believe that this man is or once was a man of great power and respect."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are there windows in the room?","response":"DM: There are two windows. They are currently shut with curtains."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You should show him.","response":"DM: You, Percy, recognize this man. He was once the chancellor to your father, and a long-respected philosopher in Whitestone known as Archibald Desnae."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Archibald Desnitt?","response":"DM: Desnae. He was very well-respected. Very stern, and crotchety at times, but very much aided your family in holding the city together in times of strife."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I pull out Sir Kerrion's notebook and I hand it to them and I say, this should be some proof that we mean what we say.","response":"DM: Reaches out, and his long, spindly fingers grap around the tome, pull it towards him. “So you bring a trinket. That is helpful. But to kill one mortal man is no feat compared to the darkness that lies in that castle. You need more than that.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I remove my hat.\nSAM: Can I drop it on one of us, or do I have to drop it on all of us?","response":"DM: I'd say you can drop it on an individual, if you prefer."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Hello, Archie.","response":"DM: “Percival? Sweet Percival.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Not so sweet these days. I did not think you would have lived.","response":"DM: “I thought you had perished in the subjugation. Percival, you have no idea the joy this brings to my heart.” And he reaches out and touches the edge of your face like he's still in disbelief. “Your hair. It seems age has caught up to you, as well.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It was difficult, leaving.","response":"DM: You see a smile creep across his very tense old-man face, and he looks about the room with a renewed energy that wasn't there before."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: My friends are strong.","response":"DM: “With you here, Percival, we've two de Rolos spearheading the rebellion. We have the guiding light the people need.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Who else survived?","response":"DM: “We must succeed, Percival. If this fails, there won't be anyone else left to rise up. They are nearing their goal, according to your sister Cassandra. We haven't much time. Your sister lives, Percival.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh shit!","response":"DM: “She survived the attack and was taken as the personal assistant and slave of the Briarwoods and used as an example, a symbol of their dominance. She has been feeding us information for years, whenever she could. She was the helping guide, the last two attempts we've made. We have not received a letter from her in weeks now, but know you are not the only surviving member of your family. I will talk to your people. I will talk to mine. We'll have your militia. Guide us, Percival Fredrickstein von Mussel Klossowski de Rolo III. Guide us, Vox Machina.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait. You know who we are? How does he know?","response":"DM: “Some of us have information all over these lands. We've had a few friends come from Emon over the past couple years. They met some dire ends. Don't think that we haven't heard of your exploits. Help us bring a dawn back to this land.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I may have a plan. How fares Professor Anders?","response":"DM: “Professor Anders has been lost to us since before the insurrection. He is a man taken by what promises the Briarwoods have given him. What little he has shown his face in this town, he is not the man he once was, or at least the man we thought he was was never who he truly claimed to be.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: He lives in the house in the east? House in the north?","response":"DM: “He lives in the castle with the Briarwoods, as well.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Lady Ripley lives in one of those mansions.","response":"DM: “She did. There have been reports in recent days that she's been quick to pack. We know not where she resides now.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Who lives in the third house?","response":"DM: “Here.” And he takes a moment to think of which house you're referring to."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We burned one of them.","response":"DM: “Yes, you did. The house is Kerrion's house, and then there are two other homesteads of the new nobles, one of which is currently held by the Duke,” he says with disdain. “Goran Vedmire.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Goran Quagmire?\nLAURA and SAM: Vedmire.","response":"DM: “Vedmire. He has supposedly been put in watch at the temple of Pelor, but he's left that to ruin. The other home houses Count Tylieri, a rather sadistic man who oversees the timber production of Whitestone.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The what production?","response":"DM: “Timber.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is that the house that the Countess was briefly residing in?","response":"DM: “Briefly.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Count Tygieri?","response":"DM: “Tylieri.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Tylieri. How are these men, the duke and the count? What do the people think of them?","response":"DM: “The Briarwoods, when they took Whitestone, did not take it alone. They came to this land with a small army of cutthroats, mercenaries, sell-swords they brought over from whichever forsaken land they came from. Each one of those men that then proved to be of utmost use to them in that rebellion, they were given titles and nobility and homesteads. They were given responsibilities over the land, the people beneath them. I can only assume that was part of their payment for their service.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: But they're just thugs who were particularly successful.","response":"DM: “As far as I know, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are they supernatural? Are they undead?","response":"DM: “Not to my knowledge.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: If we were to continue working our way up this totem pole, which of the two is less powerful?\nTALIESIN: Which of the two is reviled most?\nMARISHA: Yes, what would start an uprising?","response":"DM: “Count Tylieri is known for being quite the sadistic individual. Beating, torturing his servants, sometimes publicly to show his hand to those who would cross him. He would definitely be a message to send, if there were one.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have a plan.\nSAM: I've got one, too. Kill him.\nTALIESIN: Well, that's part of the plan.","response":"DM: “I would warn, the longer we wait making these messages, the stronger we build this part of the city, but also the more warning and preparation time we give to those in the castle. So the choice is yours.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We act now.\nMARISHA: Act now?\nLAURA: Against the Briarwoods?\nTRAVIS: Count Tylieri.\nTALIESIN: Here's my plan.","response":"DM: The name Tylieri catches your ear's memory. If you recall, your captive back at Greyskull Keep was previously the owner of the driver of the Briarwoods, Desmond. The one that beat him senseless until eventually Lord Briarwood saw this and then took him as his own driver."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm just a small boy, but we've seen mists at night, strange things that come out when the sun goes down. Are those focused around a central area of town, or are those everywhere?","response":"DM: “The mists are a means of intimidation. It's merely a magical precursor to the undead minions of the Briarwoods. They slink through those mists, use them as cover. If you see it, run.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thank you.\nLAURA: We heard about green fog here. Is that something?","response":"DM: “In the castle, yes. There are vents in what was once the garden. I know not the nature of these vents or what is being utilized to produce this foul, noxious odor, but it has put a scent on the city for many years.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do we know what killed the tree?","response":"DM: “We know not.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And in your time, do you know anything about Lady Delilah? What she is?","response":"DM: “The few times she's walked the city, it's been procession and power. She seems to enjoy the attention. She's a vain one, that one.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Who's this?\nLAURA and TRAVIS: Lady Delilah.\nLAURA: Does she come out during the day?","response":"DM: “She hasn't in almost a year, but she has before, yes. She walks in the sun, unlike her husband.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Unlike her husband?","response":"DM: “Yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't think she's a vampire.\nMARISHA: She may not be a vampire.\nTRAVIS: I think she's a bitch.\nTALIESIN: What do you think of a distraction?\nLAURA: What kind of distraction?\nTALIESIN: What if there was a way to start a ruckus at the Vedmire estate? Start a fire, maybe. Start a ruckus of some kind.\nSAM: The Vedmire estate?\nTALIESIN: The third house.\nSAM: The duke's. Okay, yes?\nTALIESIN: They're going to be waiting and expecting us, so if they think we're attacking one of the houses and then instead we attack the other while everyone's rushing to deal with what they think is the next attack, we attack the second home, and then when they prepare for us to attack the third home, that's when we attack the castle.\nLAURA: I like it.\nMARISHA: Wait, you want to go bam-bam-bam?\nTALIESIN: Today, it's just one. We've already dropped one.\nLAURA: The next attack will be on the Briarwoods.\nSAM: Well, he's saying create a distraction.\nLIAM: We make a big stink in the house we're not going into.\nMARISHA: That I'm cool with. Percy, how much do you want people to see the de Rolo family crest? How much do you want people to know of your presence here? Do you want a big proclamation? Because I might have that.\nTALIESIN: Will it put my sister in danger?","response":"DM: “It's hard to say.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: They don't know that I know she's alive. Perhaps keep her, just to surprise me.\nSAM: That symbol is not the de Rolo family seal, is it? It's modified.\nTALIESIN: It's a part of it. Definitely. I want them to know. They need to know.","response":"DM: “It's a tough decision. The symbol does carry the weight of the people and does carry a beacon of hope. But it, as you said, may put your sister in danger. It's hard to say. The choice is yours in how you wish to use it.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.\nMARISHA: Yes. Because I learned a trick back in the day from my father and the Air Ashari people. We used to do it as kids for fun, but it might be perfect in this circumstance.\nSAM: I did it a little in college. It's fun.\nMARISHA: Dual-wielding. I can Skywrite for you.\nLIAM: How do you mean?\nLAURA: Like a giant sparkler.\nLIAM: Like a what?\nMARISHA: In the future, they came up with these awesome things called–\nSAM, MATT, and TRAVIS: Nope!\nTRAVIS: Skywrite with clouds?\nMARISHA: Yeah, skywriting with clouds.\nLIAM: You control the clouds?\nTRAVIS: Can you actually write letters in them?\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nSAM: That's crazy talk.\nLAURA: Can you clear out clouds? Then if you can do that, can you make these gray clouds go away?\nMARISHA: Do we want the gray clouds to go away?\nLAURA: Well, sunlight would be nice as opposed to this misty fog.\nTRAVIS: That's a good point.\nMARISHA: Maybe temporarily.","response":"DM: Yeah, controlling weather on that scope is a little beyond your grasp. You can alter elements of it and you could darken elements of the cloud to form a message or a symbol if you would like, but actually removing the clouds, that would be–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can you poke a hole in them?\nMARISHA: Temporarily, yeah.\nTRAVIS: We'll remember that. Let's go pick a fight with a house!\nTALIESIN: From a distance. We pick a fight with a house from a distance so we can get to the other house and pick a fight there.\nLAURA: Is there just one of us who can make a big stink in the decoy house?\nSAM: I can probably make a big stink.\nLAURA: You could definitely make a big stink.\nLIAM: But you can catch up through one of those little doorways.\nSAM: Please, it's big for me.\nLAURA: How about this? I use one of my exploding arrows you gave me.\nSAM: Oh, those are so cool. Save those for a person.\nTRAVIS: It's a good ranged stink.\nSAM: I've got Magic Missiles. I've got all sorts of shit. I can do Stinking Clouds, I can make them see things, I can blow open their doors. I can do it. You guys go have fun.\nTALIESIN: But you can also do this from a distance so we can get you far away. You could do both.\nSAM: I'll start on the distraction.\nTALIESIN: And I'm going to give you a second arrow as well.\nLAURA: Of what?\nTALIESIN: The arrow?","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's a question-mark arrow.\nTALIESIN: It's an arrow?","response":"DM: Yeah. Write down arrow with a question mark. It looks heavily tinkered. It's a little front-loaded with the weight."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You know what it will do to the roof if it works?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, cool.\nSAM: It's a kill-Trinket arrow.\nLAURA: Oh man, you know what? I forgot I– okay, cool.\nLAURA: Just don't. I have thoughts.","response":"DM: Cool, have thoughts. Keep them going."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Arrow?","response":"DM: Arrow?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'll head over to the other house. Show me on the map where it is so I know where I'm going.\nTRAVIS: What time is it?","response":"DM: By this point in the day, it's probably around three in the afternoon."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're going to do this now.\nMARISHA: When do you want the symbol to go up?\nTALIESIN: Actually, we may not need it yet. That may actually work out well once we've–\nMARISHA: Lit the houses up?\nTALIESIN: Once it's up, can you actually write it in smoke coming off the house?\nMARISHA: Yeah, I think I could.","response":"DM: With a crack of thunder, rainfall begins to hit on the city."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Really?\nLAURA: Of course.\nMARISHA: Why is it raining again?\nLAURA: Because it's this fucking town. It's fucked. No offense. It won't be fucked soon.\nSAM: Your town sucks, weather-wise.\nTALIESIN: So the northern house or the western house?","response":"DM: “The northern house is the one that Count Tylieri currently resides in. Or no. My apologies. The northern house is the one that Duke Goran Vedmire currently exists in. The other is Count Tylieri.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So this is the mess and this is our actual?\nSAM: I'm the mess?\nTALIESIN: You're the mess.\nTALIESIN: So probably from about here.\nMARISHA: I'm going with Scanlan.\nLAURA: No, come with us, Keyleth!\nSAM: If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times. I don't need help.\nMARISHA: I wasn't trying to help you. I was trying to write the de Rolo symbol in smoke. I don't really care about you.\nTALIESIN: You can do it from the other house. It's sight-based.\nSAM: They need your magic.\nLIAM: It's no knocks against you. He's going to catch up quickly.\nSAM: And if I die, tell Pike I love her.\nLAURA: You won't die, Scanlan.\nSAM: I might. I'm a little wee man.\nTALIESIN: You're a little boy. We're making very reasonable plans with this.\nTALIESIN: I have put my hat back on, yes.","response":"DM: Okay, yes, because you're very much visibly Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Not anymore, I'm not!\nSAM: How far is the gate from the front door?","response":"DM: It's about 25, 30 feet. And the house that you're looking at right now, it's very well-crafted. Looks like it's made from a lot of the fine timber of Whitestone, the lighter woods and dark woods contrast with each other, stained to show the variation in the two. It's a very beautiful home."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Any guards? Anything around?","response":"DM: Currently, you can see there is one guard visible at the front. That's all you can see at the moment."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And if I walk around back, is there any guards around back?","response":"DM: There is a second guard around back that is just now stepping out of an outhouse that is situated behind the building."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That would excite you. I don't know why.\nSAM: Sure. Because they haven't phoned me to tell me that we're ready to go, I will become a dragonfly and buzz into the dwelling.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Meanwhile, the twins are looking at our home, sizing it up.\nSAM: Ten.","response":"DM: Okay. You turn into a fly and make your way through the bars and begin (buzzing) over the yard with your one-twentieth of a hit point in fly form. Make your way. Any of the nearby windows all seem to be shut. The front door is closed. There might be a gap, but the guard is standing in front of the door."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Again, they haven't phoned me, so I'll perch on the handrail or door frame or something just above him and wait.","response":"DM: Okay. He takes notice of your buzzing as you go by and goes back to his watching. The rest of you guys?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're sizing up the other home.\nLAURA: Yeah. Oh, how about this? Maybe we can tell Scanlan to set off the thingy. I'll come running out as my old crazy lady, saying, (screams) the house is under attack! Toward the guards guarding this house. And then I'll just stand there as they react.\nLIAM: I like it. Could we look at this house first?\nLAURA: I thought we did.\nTALIESIN: I thought you went to shoot the arrows in the other house.\nMARISHA: No, that's what Scanlan said.\nLIAM: What do I see? I'm looking all over this house.","response":"DM: Right. This house is also well-built, sturdy. Mostly wood construction, but it's all dark wood. It almost seems to disappear against the gray skies above it if you're looking from a downward perspective. It's a very dreary-looking home, built to look pretty for someone who doesn't like a lot of color. It's two stories; there are a number of windows on both stories. Looks like there is a small garden out front that has been long-ignored and died and dried up. Just  browns. Abysmal-looking. Other than that, there's not much else to say on the building."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No guards, nobody watching?","response":"DM: Not currently any guards outside of it, no."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I want to go for a circle around.\nLAURA: Stealthy. Stealth. I cast Pass Without a Trace on him.\nLAURA: Huh?","response":"DM: Can you stay within 30 feet of him?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I guess I stealth behind him.\nLAURA: Oh no. Which one should I use?\nLIAM: 28.\nLAURA: Add ten.\nLIAM: Good.\nLAURA: 36.\nSAM: Jeez!\nLIAM: That's pretty good. What did you add? Oh, because of Pass Without a Trace! Oh, 38.","response":"DM: There you go, 36 and 38, boom."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You're both discovered and killed.\nLIAM: Two humanoids are in the house, there's a guard between the home, and the warehouse thing you just described?","response":"DM: Correct. Basically, you didn't see it from your perspective. Once you went around the alleyway to the other side of it, you do see there is one guard that is slowly patrolling the outside."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispers) I can perch and take him out with an arrow.\nLIAM: You do your thing, yeah. Yeah.\nLAURA: Do you want to sneak-attack him? That might be smarter.\nLIAM: I'll start, you follow.\nLAURA: Got it.\nLAURA: Should we let Scanlan do his thing first and then we sneak attack him? Set it all in motion?\nLIAM: Yes.\nTALIESIN: All at the same time, then. On the count of three.\nMARISHA: What are we doing? Wait, what?\nSAM: What? All I heard is on the count of three. What's going on?\nLIAM: Scanlan, whatever you're going to do, I want you to get ready to do it.\nLAURA: And then we'll count to three and we'll attack.\nSAM: Shouldn't I do mine first?\nLAURA: Yeah, you do. Tell us when.\nSAM: Oh, you want me to do mine first?\nTRAVIS: Whenever you're ready.\nSAM: How about wait 30 seconds and go?\nLAURA: Got it.\nLIAM: A what?","response":"DM: I'm going to say, roll an intelligence check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on, Burt.\nSAM: Intelligence?","response":"DM: With advantage, because you're a bard. Just add your intelligence modifier."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He gave you advantage. Roll again.\nSAM: I already get advantage for intelligence checks. 19.","response":"DM: Okay. Through your bardic research and hearing many tales and seeing scribblings in books of presumably madmen, apparently, that there were certain creatures that existed long before the civilization had taken root. You have heard of some of these, one of which is the mighty and frightening triceratops. You hear it's just a fable, but it's fun to pretend to be one, sure."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Three horns and big.","response":"DM: Yep. And out of nowhere, this tiny fly (boosh) into a triceratops. (boom) Lands, crushing the man beneath you. He's going to attempt to– oh, rolled a 20 on his saving throw. So he's only going to take half damage. Go ahead and roll 3d6 crushing damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And for my move, I bash down the door.\nSAM: d20? 18.","response":"DM: Okay, yeah. Go ahead and roll another 3d6."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Three, six, that wasn't anything. Nine.\nSAM: Okay.","response":"DM: You guys?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to run up behind the one guard and beat him in the back of the head with the back of my dagger.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and roll an attack. He does not see you; this is considered a surprise attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is a surprise attack? Oh, that's good. Ooh, that's not that good. So that's 17.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so sneak attack, yeah? So here we go. Plus, get them. (mutters) 25 for the first attack. Or no, 25 for the first attack–","response":"DM: Sneak attack?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That was it.","response":"DM: Right. It's a surprise round. Don't you get double damage for being an assassin?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, so 50. All I want to do is gunk him. Like I do.","response":"DM: And that's all you needed. He had 45 hit points. (whack) With one hit to the back of his head, he crumples onto the ground, smacking into the wet grass around this field."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I look over my sister's shoulder and say, Grog! You want to play? Come on, you want to play?\nTRAVIS: Grog always wants to play!\nLIAM: Go for the door!\nTRAVIS: Fuck it. I rage.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're just going straight into the house?\nMARISHA: What are we doing? We're watching all this happen? We're all like, oh, there goes Grog.\nLIAM: Yeah, because you've said nothing.","response":"DM: You guys right now watch as now Vax runs over and tells Grog to run in and go after the front door."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, that's not what I said. I said, do you want to play?\nTRAVIS: No, I took off running.","response":"DM: Grog is running toward the door now. You guys see him bolt off, burst through the gate."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Activate the flaming warhammer.\nTALIESIN and MARISHA: I guess we're going.\nLIAM: Everybody's running at the door.\nTRAVIS: Oh. 14.","response":"DM: 14? Okay. It's not immediate impact. It takes you a second; you have to force your way through the gate. You essentially grab the two sides of it and pull and pull until eventually the chain snaps and the bars bend and you shove off one of the old doors. The gate (creaks, impact) onto the ground before you, leaving a straight look to the front door. You bolt for it. The rest of you guys give chase afterwards. You all rush to the front door of this homestead. It is currently closed."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We saw front door, we saw some sort of warehouse, and a side window with two people going, right?\nMARISHA: Let's flank.\nLAURA and LIAM: Let's go in the window.\nTRAVIS: I'll meet you in the middle!\nLAURA: Yeah, we go in the window.\nMARISHA: You said there was a door around back?\nMATT and LIAM: There's windows around back.\nMARISHA: I'll go around back.\nTALIESIN: I'll also go around back.\nLAURA: Oh, but that's only Grog in the front now.\nMARISHA: He's fine.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nLAURA: I give him Trinket. Going in with you.\nTRAVIS: You want to send him in with me? It's going to be nasty where I'm going. It's all-day buffet.\nLAURA: He's going in the door.\nTALIESIN: Can we see any of the damage? Is there any smoke rising from the house yet?","response":"DM: No, there's no smoke. There's no smoke. There's nothing sending smoke at that point."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm trying to get a better look and listen as I run closer to the windows.","response":"DM: And we will pick up at this moment next week."}
{"prompt":"(yelling)\nLAURA: Oh my gosh!\nSAM: But I'm a dinosaur!","response":"DM: I know."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm waiting for smoke.","response":"DM: I know, and we'll see how this plays out next week, because right now if we keep where this is going, this could be– we could be here until late, and I need to get out of this costume."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Still a dinosaur. Open the door.\nSAM: Scanlan on the floor. Everybody flee; there's a dinosaur.\nZAC: So I have a couple requests from the community. One of which is that every single one of you post a full-body picture of your costume and post it to Twitter so they can get a good look without being blocked by the table. I think everyone just really wants to see his legs because he's not wearing pants under that dress.\nLAURA: But he is wearing a little petticoat.\nZAC: And the other request was for you to explain how in the hell you made this, because this is amazing. They want a really quick run-down of what you did here.","response":"DM: Okay. Well, for the armor pieces, the base is Sintra, which is one-eighth of an inch thick PVC sheeting. You can buy it at sign supply stores."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (snores)","response":"DM: I know, Liam. Shut up, they asked me. So I cut those into sheets. You heat them up with a heat-gun or really hot hairdryer and you can bend it, so that was the shape for these. I ordered aluminum chainmail off eBay, straight from India, and cannibalized it to make the sheets of chainmail that I then epoxied onto the plastic. And this is a pleather that I stitched together and then adhered across it to make the trim, and that's how I made the armor."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Would you be willing to come on Mines N Crafts and do a little more detailed show-through of it? Because it's really cool, and there's details you guys can't see. Everyone was like, let him show off his swords, and I'm like, they're not real swords.","response":"DM: Nah, you can pull them out."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Yeah, you want to show them off?","response":"DM: Sure. I can't really grab them from here."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: That's very ineffective for battle, Matt.","response":"DM: I know."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So less dexterous than the video game.\nMARISHA: You can't put claymores on your back, which is a big fallacy.","response":"DM: Yeah, unfortunately I don't have the lack of clipping that an actual warrior would have in this armor. Trust me, it's a sword."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Here's a little secret for people who love video games: when the heroes pull out a gun, put a gun away, pull out a sword, put a sword away, there's a guy on the performance capture set who just catches it and walks away. Hands it into your hand, so all this, they just go (pfft) and they don't put it anywhere. They just let go of it.\nZAC: Actually, I posted that video today on twitter that one of the Critters posted and I retweeted it of Laura and Travis doing their motion-capture for Halo 5. Which guys, you should definitely check out Halo 5. Travis and Laura are both in the game.\nLAURA: We meant to announce that, yeah. It just released this week.\nZAC: Yeah, it just released this week and Travis did some of the mocap for Fred and for Nathan Fillion's character, and in the video it shows you guys basically just throwing down–\nTRAVIS: Some magic item.\nZAC: It's pretty cool.","response":"DM: So great. Yeah, and Minecraft released this week."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Story Mode!","response":"DM: Story Mode, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Yeah, we showed a little bit of that. It was like, oop, that's Matt.","response":"DM: Yeah, sorry."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is there anybody else in Story Mode of Minecraft that we should mention?","response":"DM: That are friends of ours? I mean, Cat Taber's in it–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ashley fricking Johnson!","response":"DM: I know. I thought I mentioned it previously, but yeah."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Just assume if a game's coming out, one of these guys–","response":"DM: You can't escape us."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: You can't escape. It gets really weird now every time we turn on a game and we're like, and who is this this week?\nTALIESIN: Now you know our pain.","response":"DM: Sorry about that, guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ruins every game.\nTRAVIS and LAURA: Sorry not sorry.\nTALIESIN: We heard your voice at Target.","response":"DM: What?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We were walking through Target and were like, “Hey, guys.”","response":"DM: Oh right, yeah, the Playmation toys."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You started talking at us–","response":"DM: You guys have seen the cool Marvel Playmation toys for kids, the imaginary stuff. I do Iron Man and Loki and a few other guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's the toy that all your kids are going to bitch and scream and want, and you're going to be like really, it's the most expensive toy? It's like $150. It's like the toy of the year, man. It's cool.","response":"DM: Yeah. I'm going to go play with mine. Yeah, anyway."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Well, we had some donations today for Extra Life. This was our last week for Extra Life donations, guys. As a whole, okay, we'll get through these and then I'll read the total overall, because it's something everyone in our community should be proud of.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: So, list starts right here.\n[end of transcription]\nSAM: Shit.\nTRAVIS: We fucking run.\nLAURA: Are we still running? Are we still running away?\nSAM: We just got to the tree line, right?","response":"DM: You guys haven't gotten to the tree line yet, no."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, Jesus.\nTALIESIN: We are still running.\nLAURA: We're heading out of town.\nTRAVIS: There's a shit-load of skeletons behind us.\nLAURA: Are they right behind us? I'm still riding Trinket?","response":"DM: At this time, you are on Trinket. The rest of you are running through the muddy streets. Your feet are slick against the ground, and you have to catch yourself every now and then from not tumbling forward."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Dust of Tracelessness?\nLAURA: Are the skeletons still behind us? Can we see them?","response":"DM: As you glance over, they're just now starting to pour from the town square itself, and  it was hard to see the exact number, but from your perspective in the darkened kind of just post-sunset light, you didn't see the end of it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Whoa, triple digits.\nMARISHA: We can't leave.\nLAURA: Can I trail behind on Trinket and try to cast Conjure Barrage at the incoming skeletons?","response":"DM: You'd probably have to slow down to do that, because you're a good, like, probably 50, 60 feet away from them, if not a little further. You guys are moving faster than them, so, that even the chase, they're not very quick entities."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So we're 50 or 60 feet away from the skeletons, and how far are we away from the villagers that are coming in the other direction?","response":"DM: They're about a hundred feet from you and closing."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would advise bringing them with us instead of stopping.\nLAURA: But all the villagers that aren't in armor are still in town.\nTRAVIS: Shit happens.\nMARISHA: I'm running back. I'm going back towards the skeletons.\nLAURA: I was carrying you. You're on Trinket with me, aren't you? Can he carry both of us?\nLIAM: No, I was pulling her by the arm.\nMARISHA: I break from Vax's grasp and start running back","response":"DM: Go ahead and make– this is technically breaking a grapple."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I do want to trail back a little on Trinket and try to cast Conjure Barrage as we're running.","response":"DM: Okay, so, so Trinket begins to turn around. You're fighting. It would be either acrobatics or athletics versus your athletics."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Athletics. Ooh, I rolled an 18.\nSAM: Five!\nSAM: You never could keep a lady.\nLIAM: I immediately pivot around and follow.\nTALIESIN: Ditto.\nMARISHA: I start conjuring up a 4th-level Flaming Sphere.","response":"DM: Keep in mind you still have Call Lightning coming, so you would be losing the Call Lightning at this time."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Flaming Sphere.","response":"DM: Okay. So with that, the darkened clouds that had gathered begin to slowly disperse as you begin to focus, running forward. As you are charging, using the momentum, the air around you begins to slowly grow and ignite before a ball of flame bursts into your peripheral, and you can control it at will."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, how far away is the horde?","response":"DM: At this point now, they're about 30 feet away. Since you went right back towards them as opposed to running away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Am I in front of her?","response":"DM: You're now, because you gave chase shortly after she ran off, so you guys are about tandem."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, here's my question. Are they funneling down one main street? How wide is that street?","response":"DM: About 20 feet."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, with my flaming sphere hovering above me, I'm going to throw up a wall of stone.\nLAURA: Okay wait, not before I shoot my Conjure Barrage, because I said I wanted to fucking do it before you did that.\nMARISHA: Conjure a barrage first.","response":"DM: What, what's the distance on Conjure Barrage?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think it's a 60-foot cone.","response":"DM: Okay, then yeah, you can definitely attempt that. Okay. So, as you create this sphere, and it's rolling to your side as you begin to concentrate and look over your shoulder, and you see Trinket (heavy steps) running up, with just mud slung as each one of his claws begins digging into the earth, pulling him forward. (bear roars) On his back, you see Vex pull out an arrow, pull back, and concentrate. The arrow itself seems to split and shatter in her hand, almost like the wood itself divides into five or six different shards. As you release the arrow, it bursts into a funneling cloud of sharp wooden splinters that fires out from the front of you. What's the DC on that spell?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It would be 15.","response":"DM: 15 DC, and is that dex?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Dexterity, yeah.\nLIAM: He's just got to roll for a hundred skeletons.\nLAURA: I know, no problem.","response":"DM: The ones that are in range would be about 12 at that point."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (scoffs) Only 12.","response":"DM: Okay. Given the average of rolls there, the explosion of splinters just shoots outward, just completely disintegrating the first row of about five or six of them. About five or six past them get a bunch of splinter in their bone, their rib cages shatter open, and they (skeletal gargle) try and move forward before they collapse in on their own structure and (clatter) scatter into the mud. Let's say you destroyed ten of them."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: You can still see about 50 or 60 slow pushing towards you at this point in time. Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I throw up a wall of stone. Am I near the Sun Tree again?\nLAURA: We've left the Sun Tree.","response":"DM: You guys left the Sun Tree, and you've gone westward, it would be from your perspective. Westward across the city, towards the treeline."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And now we're doubling back.","response":"DM: You're now doubling back. At this point, however, the undead horde has filtered into the town square and is currently between you and the Sun Tree."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, so what I'm going to do is, I want to conjure it from underneath me, so as I see them filtering up, I want to pop it up right from underneath me to where I'm on top of it.","response":"DM: Okay, and the width of it's going to cover the entire street? Okay. (swoosh) The wall of stone lifts you up at its maximum height. What's the maximum height of that spell?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Keep that cast hand feeling firm.\nMARISHA: Ten feet.\nLAURA: The hand went down, the spell went away.\nMARISHA: Ten foot by ten foot panels.","response":"DM: Can you repeat that? I lost my phone for my app, so I'm going to use this book here. So, ten feet?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ten feet.\nMARISHA: So I'm going to take the fire sphere, and just start funneling it right down and start cleaning house.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Beyond the wall?\nMARISHA: Just yeah, right into the thick mess of them.","response":"DM: Okay. The flaming sphere begins to move over the wall. You've done your action, and you begin to push that forward, because the sphere moving through you would get to about your space. So next turn we'll get to that. You guys have caught up to the wall now. The rest of you have turned around with her."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah, I ran for a few more feet, and then I looked around and no one else was running with me, so I turned around and restarted running back with my little gnome legs. (panting)","response":"DM: Okay. Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm climbing the wall.\nLIAM: Climbing the wall.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys get up on top of the wall. It's about four or five feet thick; it's a little precarious, but not too much to really bother you guys. You get to the top and you look over and you see this sea of thrashing about skeletal entities, some looking fresher than others, and all intent on trying to find some way– and you start to see some of them starting to climb up over each other to get to the height of the wall."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm just going to hold and anybody who gets too close– I'm just going to take a shot at anything that gets too close.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can you see any giants from up there?\nTALIESIN: Can I see any giants from up there?","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: While he's doing that, I'm yelling at Grog, “Grog! Throw me up over the wall! At least to the top!”\nTALIESIN: I rolled a perception of ten.","response":"DM: The rainfall is too thick. Right now, your vision is so obscured that even beyond 50, 60 feet it starts getting a little hard to make out details."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are you sure?\nLIAM: I turn back towards the villagers, who are probably running up at this point and yell, “Fire! Bring fire!”","response":"DM: The Keeper says, “Fire won't help, but I can.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM and LAURA: Oh.\nTALIESIN: Whoa.","response":"DM: “And so can she.” As he looks over his shoulder, you can see the villagers are parting, and there is, running behind them, this form of a small humanoid armored entity, but glowing. Her actual form is comprised of glowing, radiant energy, like an actual avatar of Sarenrae in the form of a tiny gnome cleric, just charging through the rain, each droplet of rain that hits her body (sizzling) just immediately evaporates on impact, and she comes charging towards you guys."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm reaching down to help her up on the top of the wall.\nMARISHA: Oh my God. Keyleth thinks she died. Keyleth thinks she's dead.\nLIAM: I'm grabbing Percy's arm and lowering him down lower because she's short.\nSAM: She's lost weight!\nTALIESIN: You look so thin!","response":"DM: With that, you lift her up, and she's lighter than you recall, and almost like a gentle feather of herself, she (light footfall) lands onto her toes on the top of the wall."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She was light already.","response":"DM: I know."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Pike?!\nASHLEY: Hi!\nLAURA: Hi!\nMARISHA: Pike, did we die?\nASHLEY: No, you're still alive.\nLIAM: How did you get here? What are you doing here? How did you get here?\nASHLEY: Oh gosh. It's a long story. I don't know if we can talk about it right now.\nASHLEY: Do we need to fight anything right now?\nLAURA: There are lots of skeletons!","response":"DM: Yeah. As you look down before you, and there is a horde of skeletons that are right now about to crush the wall. You see two right now that are lashing out. One reaches for your leg."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm taking a shot.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Let's talk later.\nLAURA: Can I have Trinket lift me? Stand up on his hind legs, and up against the wall so I can climb up?\nTALIESIN: I Percy'd.\nSAM: You broke the gun?\nMARISHA: No, he critted.\nTALIESIN: I didn't Wheaton, come on. I Percy'd.\nTALIESIN: That's a 20.","response":"DM: Whoever sent in that d20."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's weighted.\nTALIESIN: It must be. Oh, it's hollow! Nine. 15 points of damage.","response":"DM: With the rocketing (blast) sound, the Pepperbox fires, and the skeleton in front of you just explodes into splinters of bone, just… being scattered amongst the crowd of skeletons behind it. However, the moment that that one is gone, another one seems to already be crawling into its place."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Whatever you're going to do, do it! I'm firing again.","response":"DM: Okay, fire again."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 24.","response":"DM: What is it, 24?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 24. 11 points of damage.","response":"DM: 11 points of damage? (gunshot) It fires and blasts off most of the skull on the skeleton, and you can see its jaw hangs open, but it still (skeletal hiss)."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Firing one more time at it! That hit. 15, 27. Seven points of damage.","response":"DM: Okay, that one you clearly destroy the top of its skull. The rest of it just crumples into the pile and disperses amongst the chaos. The horde, though, is now as almost like a wave. There's so much of it that's pushing up against the wall and beginning to swell up to reach the top of the ten-foot wall. The flaming sphere rolls over the top and slams down into the front of the group. As it hits and impacts, go ahead and roll the damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I cast it at 4th-level, so it's doing 5d6 right now.\nMARISHA: They have to make dexterity saving throws.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, really?!\nTALIESIN: Wow.","response":"DM: One, three, nine, 20. One. I'm doing general rolls for this. It pushes through ten of them. Seven of them are destroyed, the bone cinders and burns, and then crumples into itself. A few of them manage to push out of the way, kind of (growls) watching as it rolls past. You can hear this constant pattering of rain evaporating against the flaming sphere (sizzling) as it pushes through, the mud boiling, left in its wake. As that's happening, you get up to the top. Trinket\npushes you up on the top."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah. I want to shoot Lightning Arrow down into the core of it that I can see, just a big group of them.","response":"DM: Okay. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nSAM: I want to go up there. Pike's up there!\nLAURA: 16?","response":"DM: 16? 16 definitely hits, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. And then that's– sorry, 2d8. I can't add. 4d8. There we go. 19.","response":"DM: 19 damage?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, so the first one takes full damage, (impact noise) explodes as the lightning arcs through the air, the arrow hitting the central skeleton. You see the light actually burst into the back of its skull, causing this blueish-green glow to shoot out of its eyes and mouth as it explodes and detonates."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Everything within ten feet.","response":"DM: Exactly. Ten feet total? That would be… wow."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 16.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, you are!\nLAURA: Aw, that looked like it was going to be awesome. 11.","response":"DM: 11? Okay. Don't worry about it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I look at Scanlan and I say, go get her, and I grab Scanlan by the back, and I throw him up onto the wall.","response":"DM: That's easy enough for a ten-foot wall, oh, and for a gnome, so with that, Scanlan leaps up, and you land next to Pike."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hi, baby! It's been so long. Man, you look good. Aw, man, I'm so distracted by your beauty. Hey, let's kick some ass together, shall we?\nASHLEY: Kick some ass! Come on, let's go!","response":"DM: And with that, both Scanlan and Pike, what do you guys want to do?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ladies first.\nASHLEY: Can I jump off of the wall?","response":"DM: You can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Into the group?!","response":"DM: You can, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah. I can? Okay. I want to try… I want to see what happens if I cast Turn Undead.","response":"DM: Or Destroy Undead. You have access to both."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh man. Okay.","response":"DM: It's a 30-foot radius."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Let's do it. I want to see it. I want to see what it does.\nASHLEY: What check was it?\nMATT, LAURA, AND TRAVIS: Athletics.\nMARISHA: This is going to be so badass. So badass.\nLAURA: Don't jinx it. Don't jinx it.\nASHLEY: What do I roll, again?","response":"DM: Rolling athletics."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: A 20 and then add your athletics.\nASHLEY: I rolled a seven.\nLIAM: Can I pick her up by the armor and throw her?\nASHLEY: Okay, hold on.","response":"DM: Okay, just get in the swing of it, first."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm so sorry, you guys. I roll a 20? And I rolled a ten. I rolled a ten. Hold on.","response":"DM: It's all good."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Natural 20!\nLAURA: Oh!\nSAM: Hey, what is she rolling, huh?\nMARISHA: She accidentally rolled a d10, so she was re-rolling for a d20, and she rolled a natural 20.","response":"DM: That's pretty fantastic."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Thank you for the translation.\nMARISHA: Yes. Oh yay!","response":"DM: Okay, then. Given that circumstance, you in this sunny, radiant form, you reach back and leap into the air, and for a split second you see with a flash of light, almost like these momentary feather angel wings, burst out of the shoulders of Pike that (whoosh) flap once and then disperse into sparkling feathers that vanish under the rain. As Pike leaps out, landing 35 feet in the center of this on top of a skeleton. You slide down its body as its shield pushes you off to the\nground, and you land on your feet, and as far as you can tell from your eye-line, all you see are chattering skulls and blades around you for all visual perspectives and a little bit of the skyline above you, a little bit of the clouded night sky. So Pike, are you going to use your action to Destroy Undead?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah!","response":"DM: Okay. Wow."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Come on, Pike.\nLAURA: Oh my gosh.","response":"DM: What's your spell DC? Be on your spell page."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: It is 16.","response":"DM: 16? Good to know. That's wisdom. They're minus one wisdom."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: There's, like, 80 skeletons he has to roll for.\nLAURA: Yeah, he's rolling a gajillion times, Ashley.\nTALIESIN: Roll.\nLAURA: Oh, goodness.\nASHLEY: I just keep hearing a thud.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nASHLEY: Thunk.\nLIAM: It's going to be like a knife through butter.\nLAURA: I can't believe he's rolling this many times.\nMARISHA: I know.","response":"DM: Okay. So, as you see all the skeletons begin to reach for you, and their blades come pulling down towards your armor, you curl into a ball, clutch your holy symbol of Sarenrae, and through the connection that has allowed you to be here in this moment, you feel this welling of radiant energy just burst out from you in this shock wave of glowing radiant force just (explosion noise) blast outward. For that entire blast wave radius, which would be the entirety of this road leading back for about 60 feet, you end up turning to ash roughly 36 of these skeletons."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Whoa!\nASHLEY: What?!","response":"DM: Just (explosion noise) the rain itself is disintegrated by the sudden wave of heat, and there is just a cloud of ash that turns to mud immediately against the rain and slams against the nearby buildings, slowly dripping down the sides. Pieces of metal armor just go slamming to the ground, rolling (clanking) into piles and piles of currently unused weapons."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Our jaws are just–\nLIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: As you look up, you can see the remainder of the horde, which you're looking at probably about at this point 20 or so skeletons still pushing forward at this point, just mindlessly rushing towards the closest thing they can see, which is this glowing beacon of a gnome in the center of the street."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my god.\nSAM: By the way, can I just say, that's my girlfriend who just did that.\nSAM: I have to go to her aid. How close are the skeletons that are approaching her right now?","response":"DM: They're going to be acting after this, so they're about 30 feet away from her, so just outside of the radius of her spell."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. I'm going to– she jumped 35 feet out there?","response":"DM: She did, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I do that?","response":"DM: If you want to try."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: She rolled a natural 20.\nLAURA: She rolled a natural 20.\nSAM: Jesus, that was hot.\nASHLEY: I can't believe I rolled a natural 20 on my first roll.\nLAURA: That is amazing.\nASHLEY: So happy, you guys.\nSAM: Man.\nASHLEY: It won't happen for the rest of the game.\nSAM: Yeah, I'm going to try to jump to her.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Do it! Do it!\nSAM: Got to limber up first, stretch out the calves.\nTALIESIN: This is going to go so poorly.\nLIAM: Natural 20 for love.\nSAM: For love? Yeah, four.\nSAM: Is this acrobatics or athletics?","response":"DM: It's athletics."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ooh, that's a nine.","response":"DM: The wall itself is slick, and as you push down, you lose your traction on the front. It doesn't cause you to fall, per se, but you manage to get ten feet off the actual wall, landing (boof) with a thud in the dirt, and Pike still 25 feet away from you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, do I still have a move, or is that my move?","response":"DM: I'm going to say that's going to be your move."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And are they clumped together by any chance?","response":"DM: They are; they're very clumped together."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, great.","response":"DM: All their friends just turned to ash, and they're now starting to climb over the armor to find their way towards Pike."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, then I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt on them. Will I hit Pike? Is she in my line of fire?","response":"DM: Not if you angle it towards the edge."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I will angle it, then.\nSAM: Oh, and also, Lightning Bolt comes out of my body?","response":"DM: Out of your body in a straight line."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can it come from my cock region?","response":"DM: If you would like to."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I would like it to just spew forth out of my gonads, just at them.\nLAURA: Of course you do.\nSAM: I'm trying to impress Pike! I've got a lightning dick!","response":"DM: An arcane display of virility, if ever there was one. Scanlan does a singular, classic, ancient technique, the arcane thrust, and with such (boosh) a bolt of energy goes firing out just barely arcing around Pike's form and slamming into a row of skeletons. Go ahead and roll your 8d6, and what's the DC on your spell? I will say because you're doing the thrust, you do not get the cone on this one."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, well it's not a– it's 17.","response":"DM: 17."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: There's no 1d6 for cube damage.","response":"DM: Not for skeletons."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (counts quietly) No wait, that's 14, 16, 20, 22!\nSAM: I'm sorry?","response":"DM: The total damage was?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 22.","response":"DM: 22. Okay, yeah. So two of them survive. You can see their kind of burnt, charred forms, and one of them's missing an arm now, and the armor itself is still (electricity noise) arcing little bits of energy. Five of them, however, just explode into black, burning bone chips."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Bone chips.","response":"DM: At which point you can now see, bolts of lightning are (lightning strike) coming down from the storm in the distance, too, as the thunderstorm itself is reaching more of a fervored pace, the rain itself getting harder and harder on you guys. So, with that, you can see looking over your shoulder on the other side of this wall another bit of skeletal horde is starting to come down one of the nearby intersections, and it's starting to come around the other side of you guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, we're getting trapped.\nTRAVIS: Oh, shock. We should have fucking run.","response":"DM: You do see, however, that the ten villagers and Keeper Yennan are currently rushing towards that group to hold them at bay and Keeper looks back over his shoulder and says, “You! Don't worry! We've got this! You do what you must. It has begun. Finish it!” And goes charging forward, holding his shield forward, rushing towards the group of skeletons. The skeletons, however– you have to do something at this point."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to hold my turn.","response":"DM: Hold your turn? Okay. The remaining 13 or so skeletons use their full movement to get up, only three of which can actually get into combat range with Pike, since their speed is only 30. That radius really messed them up, man."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah!","response":"DM: Glad you could make it tonight."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Are they closing in on Pike?","response":"DM: They are, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, then I'm going to leap off the wall and run towards Pike.","response":"DM: Okay, so you'll get there simultaneously; you'll be doing your action simultaneously. So, you run off the wall (running steps) and make it up, not a problem at all with speed. Pike, as you see the rest of the skeletons zoning in on you, Vax suddenly just rushes to your side, daggers at the ready. Three skeletons are going to take swipes at Pike. That is a 17? Nope? Oh, it's a seven. Oh, skeletons. And that is a 12. Yeah. Two of them try and swipe, and you just knock it out of the way with your shield. A third one does hit you in the front of the chest, but the armor deflects it entirely, and the blade actually sinks a little bit into your form, but the radiant energy that holds your position there just pushes it off, and the blade itself seems to almost dull from the impact."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Up yours, Harryhausen!","response":"DM: You're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How many skeletons are in range right now?","response":"DM: Well, the final seven that are currently there are within range if you wish to attack any of them. There are three that are currently in melee with her."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to take my blades and spin around, pommel out, and I'm going to start punching. I have no idea if this will do anything. There is a symbol of Sarenrae sewn into this glove right here. I'm just going to start– I don't have the Boots of Haste on, so I can just take two swings at–\nSAM: Punching?\nLIAM: Yeah. Two skeletons. One skeleton. Whatever skeleton is closest to Pike.","response":"DM: There's a skeleton right next to both you and Pike."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You still get sneak attack if you're in back of them.\nLIAM: That's true, but I have to hit.","response":"DM: So, if you're just physically punching, this is strength-based. So roll a d20. Add your strength modifier and your proficiency– although it's unarmed strike, so I don't know if you're proficient with unarmed strikes…"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, that's fine. so the first one misses entirely.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And the second one is– oh, this is probably fine for skeletons. 12, 13, 14.","response":"DM: What did you roll on the dice?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 11.","response":"DM: Yeah, you hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, that's the right hand with the symbol.","response":"DM: The symbol of Sarenrae, okay. Go ahead and roll 1d2 plus your strength modifier damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 1d2? There's no 1d2.","response":"DM: Roll a d4 and divide it by two."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's a one, so it's a one.","response":"DM: What's your modifier for strength?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Two, so it's a three.","response":"DM: So you do three points of Vax fist damage right to the skull (crushing sound)."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She killed 36 of them!","response":"DM: It hurts at impact, and you feel like the bone wobbled as the skull (bone ratchety noise) back towards you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This symbol does nothing for me. I'm here to soak up damage for you, Pike. Let them hit me in the face.\nTALIESIN: It looks great.\nMARISHA: Good craftsmanship.","response":"DM: But well done, that was a fun round."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That was a test. It's better now than against Sylas Briarwood.\nTRAVIS: Can I make it around the wall?","response":"DM: If you want to make an athletics check to leap up and use that to jump off, you– mister athletic movement and high speed."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 19?","response":"DM: Rolled a 19?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 12 and seven.","response":"DM: I'll say you leap up on the wall, use that as kind of a stepping point, and jump as far as you can. You get 20 feet forward beyond the wall (heavy landing) land with your hammer to your side, (flames ignite), flames flickering off the edge of it. You still have– I'd give you 20 more feet of movement at this point because you're a crazy-fast barbarian."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I reach them?","response":"DM: You'd be able to reach two of them, right on the other side of Pike."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: “Tee time!” And I rush up with the war hammer and swing.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Tea time?\nLAURA: Tee time. I was picturing tea; he probably meant golf.\nTRAVIS: Like Happy Gilmore.\nTALIESIN: Fist full of crumpets.\nTRAVIS: Tea time. That's a 26.","response":"DM: 26, that definitely hits. Roll for damage on the first one."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay, I don't know…\nTALIESIN: Mister Cobblemitts, I do declare.\nSAM: Get your doilies out.\nTRAVIS: Okay, 11. 12?","response":"DM: 12 damage? How much is the war hammer? Of that? Not the fire damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, just 11.","response":"DM: 11? Okay. As you smack into it, you can see the bones themselves are brittle by nature, but the solid slamming force of a thick piece of honed metal into the side of this bone-brittle creature just sends it shattering to the side. You get the feeling that these entities are particularly fragile against bludgeoning weapons. So your first strike just scatters one of the skeletons across the ground. You have one more in your reach if you want to go for your second attack."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 20.","response":"DM: 20. Go ahead and roll damage on that one."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I dodge a femur.\nASHLEY: I give Grog an air-high-five.","response":"DM: As great weapon master, I believe if you kill something, you also can use a bonus action to get a third attack. Outside of your frenzied rage. So, I mean, nothing's in– right now in melee range for you, but if you wanted to throw your hammer, you could."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm also not raging.","response":"DM: Correct. I'm saying, as part of great weapon master, you can not rage, kill something, and then get a free attack with your weapon."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well let's throw some shit, then.\nTRAVIS: 25.","response":"DM: 25 definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Ten… 14.","response":"DM: 14, doubled due to the bludgeoning vulnerability on the initial impact. The hammer slams into its rib cage, causing it to cave inward. Its entire upper body just falls into itself as the hammer, not meeting any resistance, goes beyond and (impact) splotches into the mud. Go ahead and make your athletics check to try and pull the hammer back."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Like you're attacking ribbon candy.","response":"DM: Kind of, technically."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 13.","response":"DM: 13. You just (sucking noise) pull it out with a sickening sound (thunk) catch it in the air, the blood dripping– the mud dripping off of it, but you see it burning away as the flames begin to burst through the actual mud."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You're licking the mud off?\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Never know a place until you lick the mud.","response":"DM: Burns some of the taste buds as the searing hot edge of the hammer reaches your tongue."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (pained noises)\nTRAVIS: Now I know what we're looking for.\nTALIESIN: Have to have a conversation soon.\nMARISHA: Have to have a conversation. Oh, fuck.\nSAM: 16.\nTRAVIS: Two.\nLIAM: 20.\nTALIESIN: 17.\nLAURA: 19.\nMARISHA: One.","response":"DM: So you got 20? You see in the flash of lightning in the distance. You can see just barely on the other side of the town square what looks like the outline of a giant currently slamming into something, and out of the corner of your eye, you see a second one to the south side of the city. There are still a few of these giant sentinels out there. They don't look too terribly close, but they're still on the rampage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should get out of here.\nSAM: Or kill them.\nTRAVIS: Or kill them.\nLAURA: That's a lot of giants to take on.\nSAM: There's two.\nLIAM: We need to go kill those giants right now. We have a holy gnome right now. I don't know how you came to us Pike. We need to go to them, and then we need to go to the Briarwoods now. Now.\nLAURA: I'm out of spells! We can't go to the Briarwoods now. I am out of spells.\nLIAM: Granted, we're going to the giants now.\nMARISHA: I don't think we have a choice.\nLIAM: Giants now.\nSAM: Giants. Let's go get the giants.\nTALIESIN: Yennan! Can you hold until morning?","response":"DM: As you're shouting this over, he is currently about 40 feet away right now, slamming into a front line of skeletons, grabbing his own holy symbol, and you see another similar burst of energy to the one that Pike let out earlier. (explosion) That same dull, bass-y impact sound. You feel a shudder in the ground beneath you as a series of more skeletons are immediately disintegrated in his proximity. Looks over his shoulder. “Until morning? Why wait until morning? \"We're fighting now!”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We'll do what we can.\nSAM: Hold that thought.\nTRAVIS: I'll go.\nLIAM: Giants, now.\nSAM: Giants, yes.\nLAURA: I can shoot an arrow.\nLIAM: Better than the Briarwoods plus giants; let's go get those giants right now.\nSAM: Are the two giants together or are they coming from opposite sides?\nLIAM: No, there's one over there, and there's one off in that direction.","response":"DM: One to the east, one to the south."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's split the party.\nMARISHA: Split the party! I say we do it; fuck it, let's split the party. One take east, one take west.\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay. Who's taking whom?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I'm with Pike.\nMARISHA: Spellcasters should split up. I'll go without– what did you just say?\nLAURA: I said Percy, you, me, and Vax go on one, and then these three go on another.\nALL: Yes.\nTRAVIS: I'll take the gnomes on my shoulders.\nLIAM: Ah, it's adorable.\nTALIESIN: Give you a big hug.\nMARISHA: Hey, we started something; we can't stop.","response":"DM: Who's going which direction?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Grog and the two gnomes will run south.\nLIAM: Are they to the south and west?","response":"DM: Currently to the south and east."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Why are we splitting? This is the stupidest!\nSAM: Everything we've done in this fight is the stupidest. Let's go.\nMARISHA: Let's go!\nTALIESIN: We meet to the west!\nMARISHA: We'll go east.\nTALIESIN: We're going east, but we meet to the west when we're finished.\nTRAVIS: The treeline.\nTALIESIN: Listen to your ears.\nMARISHA: Although remember, the signal's a little weak.\nTALIESIN: Once we get back to the western wall, we'll be able to hear each other.\nTALIESIN: Oh god.\nTRAVIS: Pike, do you want to help him?\nASHLEY: What did you say it was?\nLIAM: There's a person wounded, pulling themselves through the mud, saying, “Help me.”\nASHLEY: Yeah, I do. I always want to help somebody. I don't know; what do you think?\nSAM: Yeah, let's do it. Let's help him.\nASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: Okay, so you rush up to this guy. As you get up to him, you see his face is half-covered in blood; his side is very heavily wounded. It looks like he took some sort of a spear wound that then tore through his midsection. He has been bleeding out pretty heavily at this point and probably doesn't have much longer to him. As you bring Pike down below him, Pike, what are you going to do?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, I'll Cure Wounds.","response":"DM: What level?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'll do 3rd.","response":"DM: Okay, so go ahead and roll for that."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She's the best.\nSAM: Look at her, Grog. She's helping an innocent bystander. She didn't have to!\nTRAVIS: Going to step on his throat after she's done.\nSAM: She just is a people person!\nASHLEY: (garbled) 23.\nTRAVIS: 23?","response":"DM: 23? Okay, so as you reach forward, he looks up at you like he's seeing an angel walk towards him and looks scared. He's like, “No, not yet. Not yet!” And as you reach forward and touch the sides of his face with your smile of mercy and understanding, your warm hands touch the sides of his head, and the energy of Sarenrae's blessing pours through his body. You can see the insides of his armor begin to give this soft glow from where the wounds are as they close up. You can see the large gash in his side begin to stitch itself up magically, and at that point he takes a deep breath for a second and kind of turns over and is now in sitting position, breathing heavily, looking around himself, confused. “You… you're an angel. A bloody right angel.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: No, I'm not, I–","response":"DM: He reaches out for you with his hand forward. “Thank you.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I help him up.","response":"DM: He gets up and he still seems sore and bruised and there's still wounds across his body, but he's no longer on the path to terminal loss of his life. He stands up. “Okay. Okay. Thank you.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Run. Now.","response":"DM: “Oh, I intend to.” And he reaches over in the mud and finds his sword, wipes it off from the side, (war cry) turns around and rushes back in to the rest of his allies."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I like him!\nSAM: He's a good guy.\nTRAVIS: I pick Pike back up, put her on my shoulder, and we keep running.","response":"DM: Okay, you guys go charging back into the storm from the south side."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!\nSAM: It's okay, it's okay.\nLIAM: Keep telling the story.\nMARISHA: Oh god!","response":"DM: Technology. As you guys continue running forward, you go past two city streets. The whole city's dark now, it's closed down in preparation for what this evening is going to entail. So you go past these two streets to the left. Immediately, you hear the familiar sound of a large, heavy mass slamming into the ground, and as soon as you turn the corner you can see there are three people left in this one resistance brigade. There is a pile of wounded and/or killed soldiers around its feet, and it looks like it's been nearly untouched. This one apparently got the drop on them or at least they weren't fully prepared for what they were up against, and it's just swinging this giant club in the air around towards them. They're all kind of keeping their distance, not knowing if they should run or keep fighting. As you just turn around the corner, I want you guys to roll initiative."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Initiative, Ashley, initiative.\nASHLEY: Okay. Wait, I cut out right when you said, was that guy bad?\nSAM: No, he was a good guy. You did good, kid.\nASHLEY: Okay.\nMARISHA: He picked up a sword and went running back into battle.\nLIAM: Back to the fight.\nASHLEY: Okay, good.\nTRAVIS: Boss.\nSAM: 16 for me.\nTRAVIS: Yes! Me too.","response":"DM: Fantastic."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We'll go last.\nLIAM: Ooh, he's got houses.\nLAURA: Oh, wow. This one is very, very rolly. What did you get for initiative, Ashley?\nASHLEY: I got a six.\nLAURA: Aw.\nSAM: She said six?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nSAM: Aw.","response":"DM: Should be fine there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fine, fuck it.\nLIAM: Oh, look at that!\nLAURA: Whoa, he's huge! Grog is almost as big as him. Almost.\nMARISHA: You ready for this, Grog?\nLIAM: Blood of the giant, you can do this.\nMARISHA: Oh man, I'm so excited.\nLAURA: Horrified.\nMARISHA: Yeah, me too, a little horrified.\nSAM AND TRAVIS: 16.\nSAM: Six for her.\nMARISHA: Does Trinket– where's Trinket?\nLAURA: I'm riding Trinket.\nMARISHA: Oh, we're riding Trinket.\nLAURA: I'm riding Trinket.\nMARISHA: You're riding Trinket, okay.\nSAM: I'll go first. I'm not going to do much, but I will take out my Wand of Magic Missiles, because I've got to use everything I got. And I will shoot, fuck it, six missiles, I'll use six of the slots. So it's three plus another five.","response":"DM: Okay, and how many total do you have on there?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Every day it recharges and I rolled and it's back up to seven.","response":"DM: Okay, got you. So seven is the max you can hold for that. Okay. So you're using the last of yours for this, this is the last."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I am using six of the seven.","response":"DM: Okay, got you. Okay. Got you. Then go ahead and roll for that."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Put the stank on this guy.\nSAM: What do I do? 11. I don't– what am I adding to this?","response":"DM: Well, for Magic Missile, you keep firing–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It just happens.\nSAM: Yeah.\nSAM: Okay. Three, five, eight, 12. 14, 15, 17. 17 plus eight. 25.","response":"DM: 25 points of damage to the giant. As you jump off Grog's shoulder, pull out your wand, it all of a sudden glows for a second, and from that point like a swarming anime missile storm, these unerringly hitting arcane missiles slamming into the sides of the giant. (growls) You can see bits of its flesh unfolding and spilling off to the side, exposing some bone underneath, as all of a sudden its attention shifts, looking over its shoulder at the three of you. As it begins to\nright itself, preparing being flanked on each side, a little bit of undead intelligence within its brain knowing how to defend itself. (growls)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: As my movement, I'm going to– where am I?","response":"DM: You're right here, on the side of Grog."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to move just in that thing. Where's the laser?\nTALIESIN: Oh, the thingie?\nSAM: I don't know. I'm going to move to my left into that little alcove there.","response":"DM: Okay, so you're kind of hiding around the wall of the one of the buildings, and as you dart to the side, kind of glancing around the corner."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And I'll sing a song of inspiration for Grog.\nSAM: (sings) Well now Whitestone's got problems, and now we really can't solve them, unless we make really deep cuts, so baby show me that Grog blood!","response":"DM: Take your d10 inspiration."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Wow.","response":"DM: Grog, you're up. Hearing this beat in the back of your head as Scanlan's stomping his foot–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: This is my jam!\nTRAVIS: I go into a frenzied rage and I rush the stone giant from behind. And I take aim at his right–","response":"DM: You guys are almost in the same position, there."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: At his right leg, yeah–","response":"DM: Oh, you're spooning."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I aim at the back of his right knee.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17?","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Should I roll damage first? Or all three.","response":"DM: There's no other current combat target, so you can roll all three, it's fine."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 26?","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 24, sorry. And 19.","response":"DM: Hits. He's very slow-moving and a very large target, he's very easy to hit, thankfully. So as you rush up, first, what you got?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 22 for the first one.","response":"DM: 22, nice."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 13 for the second one.","response":"DM: Nice."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 15 for the third one.","response":"DM: Nice! (whack) You slam the hammer into the side of one of its calves. It buckles for a second and you can see the muscle itself kind of snap and a piece of bone is now jutting out of the side of its leg."}
{"prompt":"(all yell)\nTRAVIS: Yes, yes!\nLAURA: His face as he said it.","response":"DM: That's an 18 plus nine, so it's–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 27, halved.","response":"DM: Well no, that's to hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, the hit. Got you.\nTRAVIS: Damn.","response":"DM: From all three of them just stabbing it with a blade in the side. That ends its turn, bringing it to the top, Pike, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Go Pike!\nASHLEY: Wait, I rolled a six!","response":"DM: Yeah. Now it's your turn."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: It's already my turn?","response":"DM: Yep, everyone else went. It's your turn."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. So I'm going to Guiding Bolt.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: That guy. Or wait, is anybody– where are you at?\nSAM: He's right there, but go ahead. Go ahead, Pike.\nSAM: Light him up.","response":"DM: You got this."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Friendly fire just turns Grog on.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just getting a warm-up right now.","response":"DM: So go ahead and make a ranged spell attack. Roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Most of his damage comes from behind.\nASHLEY: 17.","response":"DM: Okay, are you casting it at 1st level or a higher level?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'll cast it at a four.\nTRAVIS: 17.","response":"DM: 17 definitely hits, so go ahead and roll 7d6 radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What?\nSAM: Wait, what?\nLAURA: How did we not have Pike with us this whole time?","response":"DM: 7d6 radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh no, Grog, that means you're going to get that much damage.\nTRAVIS: But I'm a good person.\nMARISHA: Yeah, it's radiant, it should do more against him.","response":"DM: Actually, this is a single-target spell, there's no radius to this."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 24.","response":"DM: 24 points of radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yes.\nSAM: From Pike or from everybody?","response":"DM: No, the next person to attack it gets advantage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Did I take any damage?\nASHLEY: Where am I, sorry?\nLAURA: Oh, can you not see? You're far away.\nASHLEY: I can't see very well. I'll stay.","response":"DM: Okay, you'll stay where you are. Okay, you keep your distance from it, let Grog do his thing. Okay, that brings us to the top of the round. Grog, Scanlan, you guys are up again."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Would you like to go?\nSAM: Next attack has advantage, I defer to you. I'll hold my roll.\nTRAVIS: Sweet. If he's starting to lean down, I want to take his head and turn it into a tee-ball target.\nMARISHA: Don't forget about your weapon master thing.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, but then he gets advantage.","response":"DM: The thing is, you can use the minus five to hit plus ten to damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, that one.","response":"DM: It's what he's been doing."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I didn't do it on the last one. Let's do it! Why not? Okay. We'll do great weapon master. We'll use it on that one.\nSAM: Oh, you have advantage too.\nLAURA: Yeah, you have advantage.\nTRAVIS: That's even worse.","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, that was better.\nTRAVIS: 16?","response":"DM: 16 hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh good, okay.","response":"DM: Once again, big target, not very hard to hit, just has a lot of hit points."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 16 again.","response":"DM: 16 also hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That'll work. 26.\nTALIESIN: Kill it with fire.\nTRAVIS: Kill it with fire. Sorry. Ten, 11, 21–\nLAURA: Plus another ten for great weapon–\nTRAVIS: I did it, yeah. That was 11 plus ten.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 15, so 25.\nLIAM: Can these actors do addition?\nTRAVIS: 18, 23, 33.","response":"DM: 33 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Holy shit. Nice!\nTRAVIS: Dibs!","response":"DM: But it's still standing."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Without a head?!","response":"DM: His head's still there. His jaw is dislodged. The lower half of his jaw is missing. It's just this open part. His tongue dangling loosely out of the bottom. Part of its head caved inward, just (deep zombie groan)."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Shove my hand up your skull and work you like a sock puppet!","response":"DM: Are you going to stay where you are, Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.\nSAM: How far can I move?","response":"DM: You can move 25 feet, so five squares."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 25? That's it?","response":"DM: You're a little gnome, dude. You have little legs."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I get next to Grog? Can I get near Grog? Can I get at an angle where I won't hit Grog with lightning?\nSAM: Oh, I don't care about those guys.\nSAM: I guess I should. Pike's with me. I've got to do this right. Damn it! (groans) If only you weren't here, Pike. Pike, don't look!","response":"DM: What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You shoot it at an angle up at his head. Up into the sky.","response":"DM: He's tall. He's down a little bit because of the impact that Grog gave, but at a higher angle, you could probably hit him without hitting the other guy."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. I will angle up. This time, I would like the lightning to come from my ass.","response":"DM: You're William Wallace-ing it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes. And I'll just lightning him at normal lightning damage.\nLAURA: How can you even aim like that, Scanlan?\nSAM: Oh, I have practiced aiming things with my ass in this campaign.","response":"DM: Very true. Sadly."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (counts quietly) 28.\nSAM: What? I just farted lightning on him!","response":"DM: That ends your turn?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'll inspire Pike. I'll turn to her and I'll say, (sings) I wish they all could be cleric gnomian girls.\nLAURA: Hear that, Scanlan? Friendship.\nSAM: Friendship? Aw, man.\nSAM: Two?\nTALIESIN: I was about to say, the guard is there.\nLAURA: Against it. Against it.","response":"DM: That somehow actually misses with a two. That does hit, though, so it takes– oh, nice– eight points of slashing damage from one of the guards that, as it runs by, just swings out and slashes across its thigh. As it comes up towards you, it (zombie groan), its tongue dangling out, this horrible gurgling sound coming out of what is now technically its open throat. As it brings its club upward–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: As my reaction, I bring up my shawm– it's a horn– and I blow the note. The note is like Dumb and Dumber, the sound he makes? (off-key horn noise) That most annoying sound. (off-key horn noise) And mash all my fingers down.","response":"DM: Okay. Is this your–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: This is my trying to– Cutting Words!\nSAM: What is this?\nTALIESIN AND MARISHA: That is a ten.\nMARISHA: Big money, no whammies.\nSAM: One.\nMARISHA: Fuck!","response":"DM: So, 20. Does that hit?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: That hits.\nSAM: Oh, my shawm!","response":"DM: You take 20 points of bludgeoning damage from the first strike and your shawm is bent and (weak horn noise) not quite– you'll probably have to buy a new one or get that repaired. You almost lost a tooth in the process. As you're like, (groans) from the impact, you pull back and you can feel already, the pulsing of the blood from the veins that have burst. It brings up its club one more time. (roars)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, god.","response":"DM: That is going to be a 13."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That misses!","response":"DM: This time as it brings its club up, you see the arc, and you–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm ducking down to work on the shawm.","response":"DM: (whoosh) The swing is completely out of your view."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Nice natural 20.","response":"DM: So that's seven points of slashing damage from the first one, and then the critical. Ooh, nice. And a six on that one, so that's 12, 14 points of slashing damage from the other guy. So both of the guards rush up. One of them misses entirely. One jams the blade to the hilt in the middle of its body and pulls out. The last one actually jumps up onto its back and takes the sword and slams it into its spine and drags it down. A really decent wound for anything not this big. On this size, it's a little gash, still, but it left a nice sizable wound and it opens up and this horrible smell comes reeking out. The guy almost vomits as he backs up, just (groans). The rot escaping from the wound. That ends their turn. Pike, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Put some hurt on this undead bastard.\nASHLEY: Okay. Where are you at, Scanlan?\nSAM: You mean physically or mentally? Because I'm in love with you.\nSAM: But I'm right next to Grog. Grog and I are right in front of the giant.\nASHLEY: Health-wise, where are you at?\nSAM: Oh, I'm fine. Don't worry about me, baby.\nASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to go up to the giant, where the open wound is, where that guy just broke it open. I have Sprinter's Boots, if I can't get all the way up to it.","response":"DM: Yeah, you'll have to use those to get up to him."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, I'll use Sprinter's Boots.\nASHLEY: I'm going to use my mace, and I'm going to start ripping where that wound is.\nMARISHA: Nice.","response":"DM: So go for it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, so I roll–","response":"DM: Roll to attack twice and take the higher of the two. I know you've been filming for a while."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Roll the d20 twice?\nLIAM: Roll two times, take the higher of the two.\nASHLEY: 17.","response":"DM: Okay, that's the higher of the two?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: That's the higher of the two. I had a seven and a 17.","response":"DM: Yeah, that definitely hits. Roll for the second attack because you can use your bonus action to strike because you're a war cleric."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Nine.","response":"DM: A total of nine?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Did you add it to anything?\nASHLEY: Wait, am I supposed to add something?","response":"DM: Add your attack bonus. Next to your weapon on your character sheet."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Shit. Sorry, guys!","response":"DM: It's okay! You're out of practice, girl. It's all good. You've been too busy being in someone's Blindspot."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You're busy being in the lab.\nASHLEY: Oh, 17 again!","response":"DM: 17 again. There you go. Both hit. Go ahead  and roll the damage for the mace plus, if I recall…"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I think it's 1d6 plus three. Plus seven if it's an attack hit.","response":"DM: 1d6 plus three, yep. You also have a Mace of Disruption, don't you?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Disruption. I think so, yeah.","response":"DM: What was the effect on that one? Do you have the item with you?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I do. Shit. No, I don't have the papers.\nSAM: Stolen on the subway on the way home from work.\nASHLEY: Guys, someone took it from me.","response":"DM: You also add an additional 1d8 damage to the first strike."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 2d6 radiant damage. DC 15 wisdom save.","response":"DM: It's not going to make that. It didn't make that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's now frightened of Pike until the end of her next turn.\nSAM: Ooh.\nLIAM: 2d6 radiant damage.","response":"DM: Okay. So 3d6 plus three, and then an additional 1d8 for each strike."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, what?\nASHLEY: Wait, so one more time?\nSAM: Why is she so goddamn powerful?","response":"DM: Undead, man."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Cleric vs undead.\nASHLEY: You said 3d6?","response":"DM: 3d6 plus three, plus an additional 1d8 radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: For every roll.","response":"DM: For both attacks, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: For both attacks.\nLAURA: Per attack.\nASHLEY: Fuck.\nLAURA: This is the best.\nASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: Undead."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We needed her from the get-go.\nSAM: Matt, while she's rolling, can you describe her hair at this moment? Is it whipping around? Is it in her face? Is it covering her eyes in a sexy, sweaty way?\nTALIESIN: Matted with jam.\nSAM: He's ignoring me.\nASHLEY: Can I use my d10? An additional d10 from Scanlan, for the inspiration?","response":"DM: Not for damage. That was just to hit."}

You see, through her somewhat shimmering, radiant form, the hair itself glistens against the rain. It almost doesn't even touch. Somehow immaculate in the middle of combat. You find it slow motion in your head, and for that brief moment, you remember how much it hurt to see her go and how happy you are to have her here. However, you, in the middle of your battle trance, Pike, rush up, shield ahead. You take the mace and, seeing the open wound, slam the mace in there once (wham). As you hit, the actual undead flesh burns away from the impact, leaving this ashy swath of missing flesh in its body. The creature gives out this weird, gurgly bellow (roar). Using that moment, as it rears back, how do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: She's gone. She ran away. She took her headphones off and did a lap.\nASHLEY: Okay, I'm back. Oh my gosh.","response":"DM: The magical power of this is essentially destroying the creature, so describe this however you want to, in your radiant cleric form."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, I want him to just explode with a radiant glow.","response":"DM: Okay. As he reaches back, you see this foothold on its knee as it's trying to keep itself aloft. You leap up, using your Sprinter's Boots, onto one of its knees. Jump in the air, dropping your shield and two hands on your mace, you leap in the air, slam it downward. As the mace impacts on the front of its chest, there's this brief moment of pause as it cracks into its flesh. Its head looks down at you, and there's a burst of divine energy as his entire torso (explosion) rips open. What would be organs within that exposed, however, are all also turned to ash as the body (death rattle) dissipates and disintegrates, falling into a puddle of liquid, messy, muddy ash and bits and pieces of remaining giant there. As Pike lands on the ground, three-point landing, mace in one hand. Walks over and picks up her shield and looks over her shoulder at Grog and Scanlan."}

Welcome back, Pike.","response":"DM: The three soldiers who are now there, looking dumbfounded at this moment, step forward and– you look like fighters, except you have this glowing, divine entity amongst the three of you. He steps forward. “If I might ask, who are you, and how did you do that?”"}

To the city wall.\nSAM: We'll head west to our appointed meeting spot.\nLAURA: Wild, wild west.\nMARISHA: Vaguely west.\nSAM: As we go, I'm looking at clotheslines for any sort of beret type of a hat.","response":"DM: Roll perception."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can we roll hit dice at any time during the day?","response":"DM: Only during a short rest."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Got it.\nSAM: 13.","response":"DM: 13. Not in this weather. Not in this city."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A yarmulke? Anything?","response":"DM: Nope. Whitestone? Not really a beret kind of people."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm a little thing. I have a little head. Maybe it could be just a shoulder pad.","response":"DM: Like a sock. Sure! There's also no laundry left out during the middle of a rainstorm."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Maybe they're terribly irresponsible.","response":"DM: It could be. Unfortunately, at this moment, no. You are unable to see any sort of a beret or could-be-fashioned-into-a-beret-type clothing piece."}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We're getting bold!\nLIAM: I'm going stealth.\nLAURA: I Hunter's Mark him.","response":"DM: Okay. What's the range on Hunter's Mark?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's a good question. It doesn't say.\nLAURA AND TRAVIS: 90 feet.","response":"DM: 90 feet. You're probably going to have to get a little bit closer."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, I Hunter's Mark him as soon as I can.","response":"DM: Okay, good to know. You guys all going stealth right now, or are you all rushing in?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm just going to rush in.\nMARISHA: Yeah, let's run. I'm just running. Keyleth's running.","response":"DM: Okay. The gates are slammed open; part of the metal's bent inward, like whatever was pushing the giant back at this point had slammed through the gate."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Hey, Vax?\nLIAM: I'm gone, man.\nTALIESIN: Oh, you're gone.\nLIAM: Well, I rolled a 23. Am I stealthed?","response":"DM: You feel pretty stealthy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You have an earring, though. If he's on his ass, you have a better chance of hitting him, correct?\nLIAM: Yeah, that sounds good.\nTALIESIN: Good to know.\nTRAVIS: That's just rude.","response":"DM: However, many of them being armored and armed means it wasn't a direct transition. They were probably pulled from here and given weapons elsewhere. But that's the first thought that catches your attention as you rush in here. Rain pouring down, the clapping of thunder in the distance. You can see, there are six of these soldiers that are currently hacking away at this one giant that's being pushed up towards the edge of the temple right now. It looks like it's cornered, but it's lashing out like a wild animal. Roll initiative, folks."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Initiative, initiative.\nMARISHA: Damn it! It's the second one I've rolled in a row.\nTALIESIN: I am a monster. I am a monster!\nLAURA: I've got to retire this one for a while.\nTRAVIS: You literally are a monster.\nTALIESIN: I have really high initiative.\nLAURA: Did I already Hunter's Mark him now?","response":"DM: You can now, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And Matt? As we ran, I wanted to split off from the group and go up along the side.","response":"DM: Along the side this way? Okay, so you'll be over here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I leap off Trinket as we get close.\nLIAM: 19.\nTALIESIN: Oh, I'm sorry. 26.\nTRAVIS: “Oh, I'm sorry. 26.”\nLAURA: “I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention. 26.”\nSAM: “Oh, I was reading a book. Sorry.”\nTRAVIS: Come on, Shadow Turd.\nTALIESIN: This is going to be hilarious.\nLIAM: That's what they call me.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to do something I've never done before.","response":"DM: That brings us to– Keyleth, what did you get?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no! Ten.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I'm distracted.\nTALIESIN: Pull out Bad News.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to take aim, and I'm going to wait for it to raise its club hand up. It's holding a club?","response":"DM: Actually, from this view, you can see it's actually a very large morningstar."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's a very large morningstar? Drop that. I'm going to have him drop the morningstar. Aimed shot.\nMARISHA: Come on, Percy roll! He's got shitty AC.\nTALIESIN: Thankfully, it's got shitty AC. 16?","response":"DM: 16 does hit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Drop it.\nTALIESIN: Next shot, I'm taking a sharpshooter shot. I'm reloading.","response":"DM: Yep, reload with your second attack."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Taking a sharpshooter shot.\nTALIESIN: 15?","response":"DM: 15 hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And this is also an aimed shot. Sorry, I spent another grit. So sorry for not saying that. I'll do my damage and then tell you. It was an aimed shot to the legs, so that's– oh my god. 16, 26, 32 points of damage, and it needs to make a constitution saving throw.","response":"DM: Okay. What's the DC on it?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh my god, this is insane. DC equals eight plus your proficiency modifier plus your dexterity modifier?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Proficiency modifier is four, dexterity modifier is–","response":"DM: So, 18."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, 18.\nTALIESIN AND MARISHA: Damn it.","response":"DM: Sorry."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's okay. I still did a ton of damage.","response":"DM: Yeah. (explosion) The blast took a chunk of its physical form. Splatters against the side of the temple. That ending your turn. It, having no hand at its disposal, it glances over with this slow turning head.

(whoosh, whoosh, whoosh)"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (groans)","response":"DM: That's going to be a 21 to hit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.","response":"DM: That hits? You take 28 points of bludgeoning damage and have to make a strength saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Just strength saving throw?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, I rolled a one.\nMARISHA: Fuck!","response":"DM: So it slams into you and knocks you off your feet, prone from the sheer impact. It rests on part of your arm and you have to (grunts) work hard to push it off. That will end its turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How much damage did it do to me?","response":"DM: 28."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 28?","response":"DM: 28 points of bludgeoning damage. That ends its go. Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm watching everything unfold. I see my sister roll up. I hold.","response":"DM: Okay. Vex?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I say, brother. You remember that giant a few years back?\nLIAM: I remember that giant.\nLAURA: You're up. And I shoot two arrows for my two attacks. One into his thigh and one into his breast, right here.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it. Roll for two attacks."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ooh.\nLAURA: I don't know which ones to go with!\nSAM: They both fail.\nLAURA: They both hit. They're both 24s.","response":"DM: Both 24s?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Identical.","response":"DM: Both hit, yeah. Roll damage for each."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Same thing.\nLAURA: Yeah. Plus 14 is… 26? 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, plus Hunter's Mark for both.","response":"DM: 2d6 on top of that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 33, 37 points of damage.","response":"DM: 37 points of damage. (arrows flying and landing) It slams into the knee itself, pushing out the kneecap a little bit from the side of its softened flesh. The other one (boof) sticks and disappears into its torso. You don't even see the impact. It pushes through the flesh and vanishes into its very large–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait, the whole arrow goes in? I wanted to leave some of it out.","response":"DM: Okay. We'll say for the piece of impact here. Okay, roll a strength check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I believe in you.","response":"DM: This is control over your strength on this one."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 21.","response":"DM: 21? What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA AND LIAM: 19.","response":"DM: What's your strength?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that's saving throw. Wait. Wait, yeah! Oh, damn it. 17.","response":"DM: 17. I was going to say, you have minus two strength. I know that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sorry.","response":"DM: It's okay. That's still enough. Gauging, pulling back on what little bit of focus you have as far as restraining. You're good at aim; restraining is something you have difficulty with. But you release the arrow, hitting at a very defined mark, shattering part of its rib there in the front, and the arrow sticking out by about a good six inches or so."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Nice.\nLIAM: I start running. Am I within 30 feet? It's hard to tell from here.","response":"DM: You are not."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I don't know.\nSAM: It's been a long day. We've had three sessions.","response":"DM: I feel like you used it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's what I do. He's surrounded by people, right? So, I'm going to run up to him and I'm going to start swinging up the arrows on his chest and get up to his head.","response":"DM: Okay. So you run up, planting a foot on its thigh, leap in the air, grab onto the arrow that Vex left in its chest, whip upward, and while you're in the air towards its face, go ahead and make your attack."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, Legolas.","response":"DM: You only get one attack because you used your bonus action to dash."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah. Never mind. Nine is a 20.","response":"DM: You do have advantage on this, if you wish to roll. You technically have him flanked with the other guy."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's a 26.","response":"DM: That hits, definitely."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, with Flametongue.\nLIAM: Right.","response":"DM: Cool."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's it.\nTRAVIS: Guards.\nTALIESIN: Guards.","response":"DM: Oh, natural 20. These are the resistance members."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I haven't had a natural 20 in the game.\nLAURA: Ever?\nTRAVIS: In a long time. Except when I head-butted a fomorian.\nTALIESIN: Would you like to borrow my die and see if it does anything?\nTRAVIS: No, you keep your Golden Snitch.\nLAURA: I think it's just you.\nSAM: Keep your cheated die all for yourself, there.\nTRAVIS: Harry Potter.","response":"DM: 21 points of damage for the non-criticals."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's hollow.\nLAURA: What is he doing? What's happening over there?","response":"DM: So, all the guards now seeing this opening and these sudden heroes rushing in to attack it use this opening. Some have shortswords, some have spears. They start jamming them into its sides, beginning to take chunks out of it and basically scraping away its form, its mass that is keeping it aloft through this necromantic enchantment. That ends their turn. Keyleth, you're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, so you're on him.\nLIAM: I'm not.","response":"DM: Landed beside him now, after he pulled the blade out of its face."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm right below his undead dinger.\nMARISHA: But there's a ton of people surrounding him.","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So light him up.\nMARISHA: Okay. I'm going to kill everybody if I start bringing down bolts of lightning. So I'm going to move up a little bit, to where I'm within 30 feet of him. Over here or something?","response":"DM: That'll put you just at 30 feet."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I see Vax?","response":"DM: Yeah, you can barely see Vax. Vax is hard to see, period, but you can barely see Vax at this point."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nLAURA: It's night. He's in black.\nMARISHA: So, looking at the giant and realizing that if I bring lightning down, I'll just start electrocuting everybody around, I meditate for a second and go super calm and start casting Heat Metal, and I start meditating on Vax's daggers.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So your daggers are going to do an extra 2d8 damage. And he's up against a wall, correct?","response":"DM: He's currently up against the edge of the temple, yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to use my bonus. I'm running fucking low on spells. Fuck, I don't want to do it. I'm going to do my bonus action to cast Grasping Vine.","response":"DM: Just so you're aware, Heat Metal does 2d8 damage to him for holding onto it. It doesn't do additional damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I say we move forward.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You're going to just take it?\nLIAM: It's done. She cast it. Let's go on.","response":"DM: Just letting you know for future reference."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. It's because it worked that way in Pathfinder. I used to do that with Grog's axe all the time.\nSAM: Stupid Pathfinder.\nLAURA: But you also had to touch his axe.","response":"DM: So Vax, you immediately take 2d8 points of fire damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes sir.","response":"DM: And you have to make a constitution saving throw vs her DC, or you drop both of your daggers."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's fun.\nMARISHA: Thanks, Sam.\nLIAM: What am I doing?","response":"DM: Make a constitution saving throw. What's the DC on your spells?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: My spell save DC? 18.\nLIAM: Fuck a duck, that's hot!","response":"DM: Both daggers just drop to the ground. As they both slam into the mud, (sizzling sound)."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm like, yeah. We're going to hurt this motherfucker so bad.","response":"DM: She's not even watching. She's just concentrating on it. And then with your bonus action?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Bonus action, I'm going to wrap him up with a Grasping Vine and try to restrain him.","response":"DM: Okay, so you open your eyes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm like, man, I'm such a fucking badass right now. What am I doing?","response":"DM: So you're going to restrain him with a Grasping Vine."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah. I think he has to save against it.","response":"DM: Yeah, make a dexterity saving throw or be pulled. It doesn't restrain, it just pulls them towards the vine. Since he's already against the wall, you can pull him away or toward."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Nothing you do does what you want it to do.\nMARISHA: Fucking fail.","response":"DM: Read the spells! The information's right there!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: So you're pulling him towards you?\nLAURA: You can pull him towards the ground, can't you?\nMARISHA: Yeah, can I pull him towards the center of the earth?","response":"DM: Because of his– sure."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That's a no.\nSAM: Nice!","response":"DM: You did something."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thanks, man.","response":"DM: You're welcome."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Man, I'm so cool right now. I'm concentrating so hard!","response":"DM: You finish concentrating, you release the Grasping Vine, it pulls a little hard to the ground. You see its form go (groans). It doesn't look very happy, and you see Vax going, (gasps). There are these little cylinders of steam rising up from the ground where his daggers are currently (sizzling noise)."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And she's like, well, deal with it! It's going to be awesome!","response":"DM: That ends your turn. We're back to the top of the round. Percy, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm pinned and annoyed. I'm shooting him in the face.","response":"DM: Okay, so you're prone."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Am I prone?","response":"DM: You're prone. The boulder knocked you prone."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, can I use my movement to get up?","response":"DM: You can. You get up and use half of your movement."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (grunts) I get up, shake it off, pull up for another shot. Shooting at his face. I'm reloading, shooting at his face.","response":"DM: You're reloading and then shooting."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Bad News or Pepperbox?\nTALIESIN: Bad News. I'm doing the same thing I was doing before, so that's eight plus seven. 15 to hit?","response":"DM: 15 does hit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 15 hits, so that's… ugh. That's 20 points of damage.\nTALIESIN: And now he has disadvantage on his attacks for the next round.","response":"DM: Okay, so this is the headshot?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And just because I'm feeling like a jerk, I'm burning an action surge. Forget it. Reloading– oh, I've actually–","response":"DM: You've already used your action surge for the day."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, it's a short rest.","response":"DM: Oh, it is a short rest? Yeah, go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I checked. I'm being good. That's 11. That hits. I'm out of grit points.\nMARISHA: Kill something.\nTALIESIN: 32 points of damage.\nTALIESIN: Reload, fire again. That also hits.","response":"DM: His AC is eight, by the way. It's a big heaping pile of hit points. It's not hard to hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Pile of undead goo.","response":"DM: You've attacked it enough that you gather it's pretty easy to hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, there was a 12 and I was like, what?\nTALIESIN: 14, 24, 30 points of damage. And now I'm going to use my bonus action to heal.\nTALIESIN: Heal myself. That's 19 points healed.\nTALIESIN: Disadvantage.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And he's grappled.","response":"DM: An 11 and a one. Grappling just prevents movement, but yeah, he goes in and swings wide and you just duck out of the way, dodge off to the side. (boosh) It slams and gets stuck in the mud and there's a (sucking noise) horrible sucking sound as it has to pull it out of the ground with all of its might. That ends its turn. This giant's in a bad place. You're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What position is it in?","response":"DM: It's currently kneeled forward, just pulling its morningstar out of the mud."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (pants) I reach down and I grab the scalding-hot daggers again, and I lift them up, and lunge and sink into its ribs.","response":"DM: Okay. You take 2d8 points of fire damage. Roll it, Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So does he, right? Because that's kind of badass. Seven points of damage.\nLIAM: Oh, you roll? Seven or eight, yeah.","response":"DM: You pick up the daggers, take the damage, lift them up to go in for the attack. Roll for the attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The first one hits. That's a 30. And the second one is 17. And he's still surrounded, so the first one is going to sneak attack his ass. Two plus three, nine, ten, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17.\nLIAM: 17. On the second attack, Flametongue gets seven.","response":"DM: Seven, okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Plus 2d8 for your fire damage.\nLIAM: Oh, plus 2d8 for the fire damage.\nMARISHA: Does he also get the fire damage?\nLIAM: That's a yeah. If I get burned, he gets burned, right?","response":"DM: I'll allow it. That's not usually how the spell works. I'll allow it for this circumstance. Since you're taking the damage to do the attack, I'll let it happen."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I didn't move. Can I use a bonus action, at this point?","response":"DM: You used a bonus action for your second attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Second attack? Okay.\nLAURA: Okay. I'm going to shoot him two times through my Blazing Bowstring, which I still have one left of.","response":"DM: First strike will be the Blazing Bowstring?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That hits. Second one hits, too.\nLAURA: Okay! What's the Blazing Bowstring, again? 1d10, okay.\nLIAM: You've got a lot of papers in there.\nLAURA: I know. I do have a lot of little papers. Six plus seven is 13, 14, 15, plus fire damage. 21, plus Hunter's Mark. 22 for the first hit.","response":"DM: Hold on."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Get it.","response":"DM: How do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that feels so good. As he's bent over, I want to–\nLIAM: You're wearing the shirt, even.\nLAURA: I know! I'm wearing the shirt! As he's bent over and I just saw my brother attack him with fire, I hit him with fire again, straight through the eyeball that's remaining, through the back of his head.","response":"DM: Okay, so as you release the arrow itself, you can feel the warmth licking the side of your face as the arrow heats up. Release it. It shoots through the air like a tracer dart, just (arrow whizzing). The giant, which is currently reaching back– it has a palm out like it's going to try to palm Vax after the attack. As it reaches up, (groans) it just (arrow whizzing) into the back of the eye, and as it sinks inside its head, (thud) there's this dull thud sound, like the fire burst on the inside of its head. Its other eye (explosion) plumps out and hangs out the side as fire darts out from that open socket. Its jaw goes slack, and it begins to lurch forward towards you and the guy next to it. Both of you guys step back out of the way as it (moans, thuds) onto the muddy ground in front of you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (pants)","response":"DM: Everyone takes a breath for a second."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I start sticking my hands in a puddle.\nLAURA: I run up with Trinket to the guards.\nMARISHA: I go up to start seeing if I can salvage anything from this giant.\nLIAM: Like my hands?\nMARISHA: Do I see Vax with his hands in the mud?","response":"DM: Yes, you see him currently putting out his hands."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What did– what?\nLIAM: Could you fix these?\nMARISHA: Oh. Did it work, though? I'm sorry.\nLIAM: Yeah, it worked, it's good, but they sting a little bit.\nMARISHA: Okay. I put my hands in his hands and cast Cure Wounds.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to use it from my ring. My spell-slot ring.","response":"DM: What level?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'll do level two.","response":"DM: Level two? Okay, so 2d8 plus six."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 12.","response":"DM: So you heal 12 hit points."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I heal. I also hold her hands for a second.\nLAURA: I walk through and bust through their hands.\nTRAVIS: There you go.\nLAURA: I want to talk to the guards.","response":"DM: The guards who currently are checking to make sure it's dead. They're stabbing its body."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Putting the guns away and walking over to the guards, as well.","response":"DM: Okay. You notice, they look like guards at first glance because the armor they're wearing is the same type of armor that the guards you've encountered here wear, but they're all, underneath the armor, wearing rags, farmer's clothing, whatever's available. It's still uniform armor and weapon design to anyone who's worked in Whitestone."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are any of them in berets?","response":"DM: You don't know because you're not there."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Damn it!\nLIAM: Are they unsullied?\nLAURA: I put my hand on one of their shoulders and say, you showed great bravery here.","response":"DM: “Thank you. Thank you for coming and helping. That got a little hairy there, for a minute. We didn't lose any of our men, thankfully, and that's thanks to you.” He reaches up for a second and wipes this black blood stuck to his chin from the fight. “So. What's next?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Now we rest up. You heal, and you get ready to attack tomorrow.\nTALIESIN: Tomorrow at dawn, we take the castle.\nTALIESIN: Spread the word.\nLAURA: Dawn.","response":"DM: “Dawn. Dawn it is.” Sheathes his weapon. The other men stand up, and one of them makes one final stab into the body of the zombie, like, “Yeah. Take that.” They begin to walk back towards town."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Before he runs off, I tell him, “Tell everyone to look for the sign of Pelor in the sky.”","response":"DM: One of them goes, “Pelor. Right.” Three of them run back to the doorway of the temple, and they all stop for a second and give a silent prayer to themselves, and then join the rest of their crew as they go walking back towards the city."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What time is it right now?","response":"DM: Right now? It's hard to tell."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hopefully, it's a while until dawn.","response":"DM: It's about two hours past sunset."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, good. We've got time! That's good.\nLIAM: I pull out my Flametongue dagger and just look in two or three graves. I don't know if there's anything in there.\nSAM: Are you trying to grave rob right now?","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: They're empty, man. That is a 15.\nTALIESIN: You're literally going to steal from my great-grandfather?\nLIAM: I'm just looking.","response":"DM: Glancing about, you notice that the coffins are still there at the bottom, but they're all open. The lids are off, and they're empty entirely. Whatever body is gone. Best you can glance about, the most that you can find, most of them are just laid to rest. One of them seems to be laid to rest with what looks to be a nice ornamental dagger of some kind that's left to their side."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Fucking do it.\nMARISHA: It could be cursed.\nTRAVIS: Do whatever you want. I'm not here.\nLIAM: Are you giving me morality lessons?\nTRAVIS: I'm not even here.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to check my family grave. The family crypt.","response":"DM: There actually is an undercroft in your castle."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, that's right!\nLIAM: I want to drop down. I'm going to take a look at that, yeah.\nLAURA: You're going to go get the dagger?\nLIAM: I'm going to look at it.\nLAURA: That ornamental dagger?","response":"DM: So you leap down into the grave…"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Tell me more about that dagger?","response":"DM: From what you can see from up there, it just looks like a fairly nice dagger, it has a little like gold sheen to it, and looks like there's gems encrusted in it from this distance."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It looks shiny.","response":"DM: So you leap down into the grave, drop, your feet hitting against the wooden bottom of the coffin. Smells musty and it's been rained in heavily, so it's not as bad as it could be. It looks to be a pretty dagger. You reach for it and pick it up and look at it, it's lightweight, it's ornamental, it's not actually more of a functional–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I want to make an arcana check.\nLAURA: It's ornamental.\nLIAM: I just want to make an arcana check.","response":"DM: Go for it, go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's a 20.","response":"DM: Natural 20?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No. 20.","response":"DM: Okay. Take a look at it, there doesn't appear to be enough of a rune structure even on this dagger to give it like a formal enchantment. It looks ritualistic and ornamental. It's probably worth a pretty penny, but it is not a–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I put it down and I pat it and I–","response":"DM: Climb back up out of the grave."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He doesn't know!\nMARISHA: Can I salvage anything from the stone giant?\nLIAM: Tourist, I'm a tourist.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a wisdom check, just roll a d20, add your six to it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just a wisdom check?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 12 total.","response":"DM: 12. Looking over the body, this entity and anything that would be functional on the stone giant's body is far rotted and necrosis has taken hold on a lot of the body parts. Nothing here would be of use in any way, shape, or form. Plus stone giants don't really have any magical components to their body, they're just larger humanoids. What small trophies you could take from it, you could sell here and there for a little bit of change, are also rotted and corroded by its undead form that it wouldn't be worth it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Their teeth are good for 1d8s, though.\nLAURA: We should head west.\nMARISHA: Head west, meet up.\nLAURA: I take the little bit of Dust of Tracelessness that we had taken from Grog and I try to sprinkle it on our tracks as we go and cover up our tracks.","response":"DM: Okay. As you pull the dust out of your pouch, you look at it, and it's turned to just sand. It seems that the Dust of Tracelessness is effective when only pulled and used directly out of its pouch–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: By its designated flower girl.","response":"DM: If taken out remotely and left on its own for a while, it becomes magically inert."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well then, I use my ranger skills to try to make it look like our tracks are hidden.\nTALIESIN: I know the city well enough to take us through a relatively–","response":"DM: Yes. This is one of those few circumstances where Percy's almost more helpful than you are as far as making your way through. The two of you together? Very helpful. You guys have been making your way through the city, making westward to meet up with the rest of the party against the wall on the western side of Whitestone. And with that, we're going to go ahead and take a quick bathroom break, bring in some snacks. So hang tight, guys, we'll be back here in just a minute."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I love you, Pike!","response":"DM: Welcome back, everyone. So. Picking up where we left off, eventually, the longest-traveling group would be the one that went all the way to the Zenith, the temple of Pelor. Eventually, the rain still heavily coming down, you guys keeping warm and out of the way to the far, far western wall, kind of keeping behind a bush. The rest of the party arrives, the gnomes and goliath barbarian waiting for you as you approach."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Taking your pee break now.","response":"DM: So. The rest of you guys gather, what are you doing? What's your plan?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We're against the wall? Should we stay in the treeline?\nLAURA: We need to hide.\nSAM: How is everyone? Did you defeat your giant?\nLAURA: Totally did.\nSAM: You know who defeated ours? Pike, because she's the fucking bomb.\nMARISHA: Pike, we've missed you so much.\nSAM: Pike, come here and give me a hug! I give her a hug. What happens?\nSAM: Just how I remember you! Warm gelatin.","response":"DM: And there is this hot wind that wraps around her and her hair is drifting a little bit. There's something, her physical form is very strange here."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How did you get here, Pike? How did you know?\nASHLEY: But today, it became too much.","response":"DM: You had received a letter from Allura, from Emon, if you recall."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I received a letter!\nASHLEY: I received a letter from Allura, and I felt that you guys– are you guys making a decision or something here in Whitestone?\nSAM: Many decisions. We've decided to take down this horrible foe, and Percy's been grappling with a lot of decisions as we've gone.\nLAURA: Pike, maybe you could help him.\nMARISHA: Yeah, can you take a look at him, Pike? I believe it's out of my realm of understanding.\nTRAVIS: Actually, Percy's just fine. Maybe she looks at him after the Briarwoods.\nTALIESIN: Well…\nMARISHA: There was a long pause.\nASHLEY: That was a very long pause.\nTRAVIS: Percy, how are you feeling?\nTALIESIN: Honestly, if Pike weren't here, I'd say fine, but… (sighs) How do you think I am, Pike?\nASHLEY: Well, most of my… my heaviness and visions were about you.\nTALIESIN: (sighs)\nASHLEY: I've been in deep prayer and meditation, and I know you guys were in a very dark place, and I prayed that Sarenrae would send me to you. And so here I am, sort of as an avatar, but I'm here, and I want to help in any way that I can. I just know something's off, and I don't quite know what that is yet.","response":"DM: Her form shimmers for a second, almost like the energy that keeps her corporeal in this location for a moment flickers, and then she is restored to her form. You get the sense that–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: This isn't going to last long.","response":"DM: That she's not actually physically here. This divine projection is a channeling of Sarenrae's power keeping her here for the moment."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Damn, Sarenrae is really freaking powerful.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I have a feeling she's probably using a lot of energy to do this, too. Pike, do you know how much longer you can stay in this form, that you can stay with us?\nASHLEY: I don't know. This is the first time that I've ever done this, so I'm hoping that it will last a long time, at least to see you through.\nTRAVIS: Oh, us, too.\nLAURA: Us, too.\nASHLEY: (fake crying)\nTRAVIS: Hey, Pike. Do you want to take Percy's temperature?\nLAURA: Should we find a place to hide first?\nASHLEY: Yeah. We're still in the open, right?\nTALIESIN: There's a secret entrance to the castle to the west, in the woods. I think perhaps if we made our way there, we could–\nMARISHA: Get inside?\nTALIESIN: Camp out, perhaps. It would be a roof over our heads if we got there, and we could take care of anyone–\nSAM: Percy's thinking very clearly. He's fine.\nLAURA: He's rubbing his eyes a lot.\nMARISHA: He's had this weird cough for a couple of days now.\nSAM: He's allergic to cats or something.\nTALIESIN: I'm not allergic to cats.\nLAURA: Pike, he has black smoke coming out of his body all the time.\nSAM: I have lightning coming out of my ass.\nLAURA: Yeah, well, you choose to do that.\nTALIESIN: Let's make our way to somewhere quiet.\nMARISHA: We'll have her look at you there. I do a Gust to do that air umbrella thing around all of us.","response":"DM: That really terrible one that doesn't work well?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, the really terrible one. I'm doing that to help keep us shielded from the rain.","response":"DM: Okay. Are you guys coasting within the city's walls, or are you moving outside of the city's walls?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Outside of the city.","response":"DM: Okay. So you find your way a little bit southward–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Stealthing.","response":"DM: Stealthing, to make your way outside of the city, into the forest surrounding the outskirts of Whitestone. Make a stealth check, guys. This is without the plus ten bonus because you don't have any more spells."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't.\nTRAVIS: Yeah! Oh. Really? I get plus two to stealth?","response":"DM: Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 18.\nLAURA: Ooh. 20.\nLIAM: 23.\nSAM: 12.\nMARISHA: 17.\nTALIESIN: 15 with disadvantage.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And Pike?\nLAURA: Pike, what did you roll for stealth? She's an apparition!\nASHLEY: I rolled a ten.","response":"DM: You rolled a ten?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Clang!\nASHLEY: Ten.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Clang, clang, clang.\nTALIESIN: Do I know what this sound is?","response":"DM: You've heard this before. It's nothing terribly dangerous. They're just natural cat-like creatures that live in the trees. Ocelot-like. They're indigenous to this region; that's them communicating. It's initially off-setting, but you keep pushing forward. I would have both of you guys make survival checks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) Survival checks?\nTALIESIN: I don't think I've ever rolled that before.\nMARISHA: Come on, city boy.\nLAURA: Oh! I have advantage.","response":"DM: That's true. And you would have advantage, actually, because you know this area."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Really? Did that just happen?\nLIAM: Wow. She rolled two threes in a row.\nLAURA: I've got to retire it. It's so beautiful, and I keep trying it.\nTRAVIS: It's certainly the die, and not you in any way.\nLAURA: It's just been punishing me, as of late.\nTALIESIN: 14.","response":"DM: 14? Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ten.","response":"DM: The two of you, working together on this– it takes you an hour or so before you eventually get further enough north and out of the outskirts of Whitestone where you begin to see the rising platform, the small central forest mesa that the castle Whitestone is built upon. You can see, through the heavy cloud cover, what little bit of torch light is visible from some of the castle interior in the distance. It's this ominous dark shape outlined against the cloud cover above you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: On that walk, while they're leading the way, I quietly walk alongside Pike and fill her in on everything I have seen happen with Percival: the smoke coming out of him, the darker turn in his personality, the way that he branded that man. Everything that I am worried about.\nSAM: The cough.\nLIAM: The cough. Everything, so that she's filled in on his darker turn.","response":"DM: Okay. Did you get that, Ashley?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I did.","response":"DM: So, pressing on, eventually catching the edge of that mountain. That, to you, is the inclination; you know this area very well, spending most of your time living around this castle. You gesture for the rest of the group to follow you up towards the edge of this central mountain platform that the castle's upon. Eventually, coasting along the side– I want you to make an investigation check, Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 16?","response":"DM: 16? Okay. Pushing forward, you spend a good 20 minutes walking back and forth. You're pretty sure that this is where the entrance is, and looking along this area, you make your way to the northern side of this mountain. No entrance seems to be appearing to you. There's no opening. There's no doorway. It was a cavern exit that was loosely hidden by a series of bushes that were clustered around it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It should be around here.\nLAURA: Can I start taking a look around and see if I see anything?\nLIAM: All of us, yeah.\nTRAVIS: We should be very careful. These two are good at using their brain muscles. Could be an ambush.\nLIAM: 26 on perception.\nLAURA: That's way better than mine. 17.","response":"DM: Okay. About ten minutes of you guys searching as you travel southward among this… okay. You guys watch along the wall, and nothing seems to be catching your eye. You notice that there's a portion of the mountainside that is looser rock. Everything here is solid, long-eroded through weather and time. There is one section that appears to have more of a crumbly, loose rock that forms the lower portion of the wall."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Big guy, come here.\nTRAVIS: What?\nLIAM: This is new. These haven't been here long. I'm not very strong; do you want to start hucking rocks?\nTRAVIS: Wait, say that again?\nLIAM: I am extremely fast and nimble and could totally fuck you up, but I can't lift that much, including door jambs. Could you help me move these rocks?\nTRAVIS: I suppose. I go and I start moving rocks.\nLIAM: You look very handsome in that beard.","response":"DM: Okay. Make an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Never forget. 18.\nTALIESIN: Does this look familiar to me?","response":"DM: This would be similar to the placement of where the bushes were that originally obscured the crawlspace that led into this tunnel."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I think this might be it.\nLAURA: Well, what happened here?\nSAM: Did they blow it?\nLAURA: Does it look like a cave-in, like somebody did it on purpose?\nMARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if this is natural or man-done?","response":"DM: Sure. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: “Man-done.”\nMARISHA: I think that's a 21.","response":"DM: 21?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, 21.","response":"DM: Inspecting this, the pattern in which it fell was very localized, which leads you to believe–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I think this was blasted down.","response":"DM: Yeah, this was blasted or was intentionally done to demolish this exit as opposed to a natural fall. At this point in time, you've pulled through a few of the larger rocks, and you roll them over and you do reveal a small tunnel."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hey, look! I found a hole.\nMARISHA: Good work, Grog.","response":"DM: About 15 minutes of pushing this stuff out of the way before you eventually find it, and it's probably a good ten feet inward."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can we get in it?","response":"DM: It's tight, but you can start moving in there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Scanlan, squish in there.\nSAM: Well, we have two gnomes with us.\nLIAM: She'll light up the hole.\nSAM: I hope so.\nSAM: I will shimmy in, just to see what's down there.","response":"DM: Okay. You make your way into this lower tunnel. A bit sharp in there. Black as night; no light source. The ground itself is very dry, which is a nice change from the rather wet exterior awaiting you outside. It generally smells musty and seems disused. And very dark."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I lean down and say, does it look like somewhere that we can rest for the night?\nSAM: Oi! I can't see anything.\nSAM: You got a torch up there, or something?\nLIAM: I flip my Flametongue dagger over backwards and hand it to him through this little hole.","response":"DM: Okay. You take the dagger."}
{"prompt":"SAM: This feels so cool. It's like a shortsword for me!","response":"DM: With the flickering light along the blade, it lights up the area. The tunnel widens up to roughly eight to ten feet wide and seems to curl forward before disappearing around a gradual edge about 50 feet ahead of you. It's about six feet tall, so the taller of you folk are going to have to crouch in, but it's about six feet tall, about eight to ten feet wide, and that continues to curl deeper in towards the mountain."}
{"prompt":"SAM: No one down here, but I don't know how far this thing goes, and I don't know how well it's guarded.\nTRAVIS: Are there trees around us?","response":"DM: Yeah. No more than maybe five feet off this mountain line, the forest grows immediately dense."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: If they've blasted in the entrance, I have a feeling–\nTALIESIN: I don't think they're expecting anyone from here.\nMARISHA: They're not expecting people.\nLIAM: This was taken care of, in their minds. I say we squeeze Grog and Trinket in here.\nSAM: And camp in the tunnel?\nLIAM: Yeah. I'll go ahead a bit and take a quick peeky-poo.\nTRAVIS: You don't think they'll patrol this area?\nLIAM: No.\nLAURA: Does it seem like there's cobwebs? Does it seem dusty and disused?","response":"DM: If you crawl inside to look…"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Are we inside? Let's all crawl in.","response":"DM: As you guys all may your way inside, glancing about– make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I light up my hands.\nSAM: I put Vax's dagger in my back pocket. Cover it up with my shirt.","response":"DM: Okay. Make a sleight-of-hand check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 20.","response":"DM: Okay. Yeah, there's been no footsteps in here for quite some time."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Seven.\nLAURA: This has definitely been disused. Disused? Is that a good word?\nTALIESIN: Abandoned.\nLAURA: “Abandoned” is a better word.","response":"DM: As she's saying this, you look over and Scanlan almost looks at you directly and goes like– He grabs your wrist and stops you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I use the other hand and I tweak his nose as hard as I can.\nSAM: Not in front of Pike!","response":"DM: Dagger's retrieved."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Pike, can you take a look at this cough before we take a rest?\nMARISHA: Yeah, take a look at him, Pike.\nTRAVIS: Are we in the tunnel?","response":"DM: You're in the tunnel right now."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I grab some of the boulders and cover up the way we came in. Or just a boulder, and move it to the mouth of it. Or is it too big?","response":"DM: You can move a few. There's no boulders quite large enough to fully close it off. You can do it; it will take you a little bit of time, but you can do it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, just to cover it up a little.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Are there two openings? The one that we came in, and then the rest of the tunnel?","response":"DM: The tunnel continues and curves out of sight, about 50 feet in."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But we blocked up the one we came through.\nTRAVIS: Oh, Keyleth? Can you make a fucking bush grow in front of this thing?\nLAURA: Or can you put up a wall to where we don't have to worry?\nTRAVIS: So if whoever was going by with those dogs while we were up in the trees the first night we got here comes by and sees a hole in the wall…\nMARISHA: Okay.\nTALIESIN: How many spells do you have left?\nMARISHA: (sighs) That's the question. It depends on if we're going to decide to–\nTALIESIN: I think we should take a rest.\nLAURA: We have to rest, yes.\nMARISHA: I'll think about it.\nLAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Could I put a Guardian of Faith above us before we make our–\nSAM: Of course you can.","response":"DM: Let's see how long that lasts for."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A what?\nLAURA: A what?","response":"DM: Yeah, it lasts for eight hours."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We came to a land of evil without–","response":"DM: Yes, you can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I can't believe we came without Pike, ever.\nASHLEY: I'm sorry.\nLAURA: Pike, stay with us forever.\nASHLEY: Okay.\nLIAM: Or at least through next week.\nLAURA: Wow. Well, there you go.\nASHLEY: Okay.\nLIAM: I think to myself, oh, that is badass.\nLAURA: I smack her on her little gelatin back and say, good work, Pike.\nTALIESIN: I don't know. I've had a cough, and I'm… complicated.\nMARISHA: I did a check on him, Pike. His cough doesn't seem to be anything natural or disease-related, so it's nothing like a fever. Not a real one, anyway.\nASHLEY: Oh boy. Okay. Can I do any extra check on him?\nTRAVIS: Yep. Drop your pants.","response":"DM: You can make a medicine check on him."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're getting the radiant digit.\nASHLEY: Did anybody already do a medicine check?","response":"DM: You haven't made one."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (quietly) Come on, Pike.\nASHLEY: 17.","response":"DM: 17? Okay. You take a moment to inspect Percy, looking at his features, checking his pulse, and generally getting a sense of his life force in general. His eyes are sunken, his jowls are shadowed. From what you recall of Percy, he was always a seemingly-healthy, if on the thin and pale side, individual. Doubly more so than you've ever seen him. There is an unrest to his energy, and there is no physical, natural illness or discernible disease, but there is something unsettling about his presence that you've never sensed before."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay. Lesser Restoration, would that do anything in this situation?\nLAURA: What about Greater Restoration?","response":"DM: You can try it. Lesser or Greater Restoration."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: If you have a Greater Restoration, Pike– I don't have it on me.\nASHLEY: Okay. I can try it. Can I try it?","response":"DM: Yeah, if you want to."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: So what are you casting? Lesser or Greater Restoration?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'll do Greater. Do you mind, Percy?\nTALIESIN: No. (sighs) No.","response":"DM: Okay, so Pike reaches up. You grab his face again, and you close your eyes and concentrate. Her hands begin to glow with an extremely bright vibrance, even moreso than her gently luminescent form right now. It's almost like there's a blowtorch of radiant energy right around his jaw. The rest of her form almost seems to put so much energy into it that her legs begin to dissipate and vanish, almost like she's putting all of her energy into this moment, the rest of her body fading into the grasp. You feel this warmth wash through your entire body, and for a brief moment, for the first time in a number of weeks, there's a moment of serenity to you. Your eyes instinctually close, and for a second, you feel like you're standing next to Pike in a void of darkness. As that warmth hits, Pike, you sense something there. You sense a seed of darkness. There's something in him that you can almost reach out and grasp, and in that imaginative space, you do. You thrust your hand out and grab onto it, and it's taut, and it's fighting, but you pull and wrest it forth, and as you do, you feel it burn and dissipate. At which point, both of you guys open your eyes, breathe in succession with each other. The energy fades from your hands and your form goes back to its full, radiant  physicality. You can remove a corruption point from yourself."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ooh!\nLAURA: Yay!\nMARISHA: A corruption point?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: He had two.\nLAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: He's still looking a little sickly, but definitely improved."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Did I heal, as well?","response":"DM: No, you just lose a corruption point."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So does that get rid of one of his weird ailments?\nSAM: He still coughs.\nTALIESIN: I do feel better.","response":"DM: The cough is still there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I watched all of that, and when I saw him lean back into the earthen wall, I quietly back up and I'm going to go down the tunnel, like 50 feet, and see–","response":"DM: Roll a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Pike, that was incredible.\nLIAM: 23.\nASHLEY: What is a corruption point?","response":"DM: You have no idea what a corruption point is, but you removed some point of corruption in his body."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can you do me next? My neck has been hurting for weeks.\nLAURA: I do that to Grog. How's that feel? How's that feel, big guy?\nTRAVIS: Oh, it's much better.","response":"DM: Almost like a small seed of sentient tumor, you removed from him."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Should I randomize which corruption point vanishes?","response":"DM: It's a compounding thing."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, it's compounding.","response":"DM: Yeah. They're not specific."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: How many do you have?","response":"DM: You don't know. You have no idea."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Sorry. I'm asking too many questions.","response":"DM: Yeah. How dare you? No, it's fine."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: How do you feel, Percy?\nTALIESIN: I feel better. I feel more like myself. (coughs)\nLAURA: But he's still coughing.\nTALIESIN: I'm still coughing, but I feel much better. Thank you.\nMARISHA: What did you just do to him, Pike?\nASHLEY: I just tried to find out what this is. This is going to sound like a very weird question, but does part of you want to hold onto some of this?\nTALIESIN: It could be. I'm not quite finished yet. We'll see where we are tomorrow.\nASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: While this is happening, Vax has vanished ahead into the tunnel on his own. You guys look around and realize that he's nowhere to be seen."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Fuck him. I go to sleep.","response":"DM: Okay. Vax, pushing ahead. Thankfully, in the darkness, you have a little bit of vision, limited as it is."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: From the glowing gnome?","response":"DM: Make a perception check. As you turn around the corner, you lose the light source."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20.","response":"DM: Okay. You continue around the edge, and the tunnel evens out for a bit and then goes straight, and then curves again to the left. Following that, it curves again to the right. You can keep going, or you can head back. You've traversed about 60 or 70 feet in this tunnel."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 60 or 70 feet? I'm going to go another 60 or 70 feet.\nSAM: Yeah!\nLAURA: Where the fuck are you?","response":"DM: You keep pushing towards this tunnel and turn to the right. You travel a bit further forward, and as the tunnel makes another sharp right turn, you see all of a sudden where the dirt stops and there is solid, smooth stonework: a broken portion of what looks like the back side of a wall of some kind. You see nothing beyond it. It looks like there is a piece of stone something pressed against it, and looks like some other things are stacked, basically covering this entrance."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I would like to just sit down on the ground and close my eyes and listen for a full minute and see if I hear anything.","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 21.","response":"DM: 21. You take a minute, close your eyes, and take in all audio you can. Stillness. Quiet. Nothing."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Pretty good. I quietly walk all the way back, and walk behind the group, and I go, goosh! Look at that.\nLAURA: I swear to Pelor, if you would have gotten us killed…\nMARISHA: Where did you go just then?\nLIAM: I was like ten feet around the corner.\nSAM: He was right here the whole time.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to take care of a little business outside, and then we'll seal up the opening.\nSAM: Excuse me? What are you doing outside?\nTALIESIN: I'm going to charge the Diplomacy glove.","response":"DM: It's already sealed. Grog already sealed it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Grog already sealed it?","response":"DM: Yeah. He pulled rocks into it and closed the exit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I glare at Vax and I lay down to go to sleep.\nSAM: Can we do it here?\nTALIESIN: We can't do it in here because it would make too much noise.\nMARISHA: This room won't fit my storm cloud.\nSAM: Wait. Pike, do you have any sort of Cone of Silence, or anything? Do you have a Cone of Silence?\nMARISHA: Why?\nSAM: He's going to make noise.\nMARISHA: No, it's not going to work.\nLIAM: I've got this. I pick up two small, roundish, oval-shaped stones from the ground, and I slide them into Grog's nostrils, plugging them up.","response":"DM: Make a sleight-of-hand check. Grog? What's your passive perception?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, ten.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Where's passive perception?\nLAURA: It's under all your other attributes.\nLIAM: 14.","response":"DM: Okay. As you step away, there's a (snort) as your nostrils are stopped up now, and the airflow is impeded partially from the way you're used to. You begin breathing heavily through the mouth in reaction."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (loud snoring)\nLAURA: I wake up to the terrible– Ugh! What is that? Grog!\nTRAVIS: And I cough, and the stones shoot out of my nose back at Vax.\nTRAVIS: With a high velocity.\nLIAM: I'm removing one hit point from my–","response":"DM: Yeah. One beans you in the side of the temple."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Covered in Grog “boge.”\nTALIESIN: I'm sleeping.\nLAURA: And the guardian that Pike conjured is guarding us?","response":"DM: Is there, just keeping ever vigil for the next eight hours."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Chilling.\nLAURA: Let's fucking rest!\nMARISHA: Who's still awake?\nTRAVIS: Be careful when you go to sleep. Shit falls in your nose.","response":"DM: Are you guys taking shifts, or are you leaving it to the guardian?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Leave it to the guardian.\nSAM: The guardian's got this.\nMARISHA: I look at Vax before we go to sleep, and I say, not going to pull any more jenga moments, are you?\nLIAM: No. No, I'm not.\nMARISHA: You sure? Because you just did that secret walkaround there. We notice when you sneak off. You do know that, right?\nLIAM: No. My rolls are too high; you really don't notice.\nTRAVIS: This is true.\nLIAM: But I'm not going anywhere.\nMARISHA: Okay. Hey. I was the only one who didn't give you shit for that. Just keep that in mind.\nTRAVIS: I did. You can fuck off and get yourself killed.\nLAURA: You're asleep.\nTRAVIS: (snores)\nLIAM: I'm going to go sit down by Percy, and what I'd like to do is watch everybody nod off, and in 20 minutes, nudge him awake.\nTALIESIN: (groans)\nLIAM: Hi.\nTALIESIN: Yes?\nLIAM: I want you to get some sleep, but I want to talk for a minute.\nTALIESIN: I don't know if I can do both of those things, but okay.\nTALIESIN: Yes?\nLIAM: What do you really know about it? How do we know that this thing isn't whispering in Sylas's ear? What do you really know about this thing?\nTALIESIN: I don't know anything about this thing, except that this last time… this last time was different than the first time. This last time didn't… (sighs) This last time, I felt more like me, and less like I was being drawn somewhere. I wasn't entirely me, but it's hard to describe. I felt like I had contained it, a bit. I feel like, maybe, maybe I can keep it under check. I don't know.\nLIAM: I want to tell you something. We're almost like family now, and I've seen you do many great things, and you have earned my trust, but if you hurt my sister… If you hurt anyone else in this group inadvertently–\nTALIESIN: I would expect no less.\nTALIESIN: Vax? I have a sister!\nLIAM: It's pretty cool, isn't it?\nTALIESIN: I'm hoping.\nLIAM: Well, hold onto that.\nTALIESIN: I shall.\nTRAVIS: I let out a little sleep fart.\nLIAM: Can I borrow just a pinch of your black powder?\nTALIESIN: No, I'm running really low. No.\nLIAM: Just a finger dab?\nTALIESIN: No. Oh, god. Yes.\nLIAM: I lick my pinky and I put it in, and I slowly draw a big ballsack on Grog's forehead.","response":"DM: Roll a sleight-of-hand check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sure.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to sleep before this happens.\nLIAM: That's a 23.","response":"DM: Grog, roll a perception check, just for the hell of it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 18?","response":"DM: Deftly blended in with the tattoos, unless those who are aware, there are strange new series of markings across Grog's face that he may not notice for quite some time."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I did do little hairs on them, as well.","response":"DM: Oh, how detailed."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, it grows here, so it grows there.\nLIAM: I don't know. Or do I?\nLIAM: He goes to sleep. I'm going to do my duty with Keyleth for a watch.\nLAURA: No, Keyleth went to sleep.\nLIAM: I thought we were both staying up.","response":"DM: You look back over at Keyleth, and she's asleep."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll stay up for two hours.","response":"DM: You stay up for the two hours. There doesn't seem to be much incident whatsoever. There's that gentle draft coming through from some of the cracks in the stones that were set up to block the entryway. It was not a perfect hole, of course, just enough to not arouse suspicion. There is cold air seeping through. You can hear the rain muffled in the distance, and there's a little bit of a leak coming through from where the stones were set up to block the entrance. Eventually, sleep comes to you. It is a strange lulling sound. Everyone sleeps, relatively comfortably for being in the middle of a stone tunnel. You have dreams again.  Dreams, images, flashes. Flashes of your family hanging from the Sun Tree. It never happened, but your mind creates the image for you. You see flashes of your sister screaming out to you as the arrows take her in the chest. You see a flash of what looks like a skull, a skull face. The skull brings itself to where you focus on one of its ocular sockets, and blood begins to pour from the socket. Flash to black. A familiar voice rings out again: “Do not forget our deal.” Cold morning air comes to you as you all slowly come to consciousness. Uncomfortable, kinks in your back. It's not the best place to sleep, but the bare minimum of the long rest is achieved throughout the evening. As you all eventually come to and check and make sure everyone's okay, you awake, a little unnerved."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I look around for Pike.\nLAURA: Is she still here?","response":"DM: Pike is just waking up. She's still there. Her image, you can see, in her sleeping state, is diminished. When she comes to consciousness, it almost flares up again. Her presence here is purely a force of will, and that connection is a very tenuous one. I would like everyone to make a constitution check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Constitution?\nMARISHA: Corruption, man.\nLAURA: Yeah, you're right. I'm going to go sparkle stone.\nLIAM: Natural 20.\nMARISHA: Son of a fuck. Natural one. My third of the evening.\nSAM: Five.","response":"DM: Five."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17.\nLAURA: 16.\nLIAM: 20.\nTALIESIN: 22.\nLAURA: You rolled a one, Keyleth?\nMARISHA: I had bad dreams.","response":"DM: The DC on this is not as high. Everyone but Keyleth passed. Keyleth, as you wake up, there's a general cold sensation within your body, and you feel like there's really no way to keep warm, no matter how hard you try and bundle up. You even use a bit of Druidcraft to create a bit of sparkling warm fire that you use to keep your hands set, and the cold doesn't seem to go away."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I keep my hands aflame and kind of rub myself.","response":"DM: Okay. Your hands are shaking unnaturally, and there's a general chatter to your teeth. You have disadvantage on any dexterity ability checks."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Glad I don't use a bow.","response":"DM: Skill checks. Wouldn't affect attacks. I will say it doesn't really affect initiative, per se, but if you were to try to do any delicate handwork, you would have disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should we, before we get this shit going, have a feast? A big fucking feast?\nSAM: We should have a feast.\nMARISHA: That sounds good, yeah.\nLAURA: We still have a couple of feasts left.\nMARISHA: I will say, if we choose to feast, I will not be able to Sunbeam.\nSAM: Well, that is a problem.\nLAURA: Should we have feasted last night?\nMARISHA: I couldn't. I burned my Sunbeam. We couldn't have done it.\nSAM: Pike can't help in any way?\nMARISHA: I don't know if Pike–\nASHLEY: I don't have that ability.\nMARISHA: Does she have access to sixth-level spells? We haven't leveled Pike up in a while.\nASHLEY: I don't know if I've–","response":"DM: You've gained a modicum of experience while you were away from the party, just at a slower rate, so you are at a lower level than the rest of the party. Not by a terrible amount, but you'd be level 11 by now, probably."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So she would have a sixth-level spell.\nLAURA: So she has Feast.\nMARISHA: It depends on if clerics have it.","response":"DM: Clerics do have access to Heroes' Feast."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Let me check.\nMARISHA: But that would also mean Pike burning her 6th-level spell slot.","response":"DM: Correct. So you would have one 6th-level spell. If you wanted to, you could prepare that as your prepared 6th-level spell for the day. That is your choice, Pike."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We get saves on all wisdom throws, which might come in handy when we're fighting against things that control our minds.\nASHLEY: Oh dang. I haven't even looked through these yet.\nLIAM: While the fancy people are talking, I walk over to Grog and say, big man. You've got mud or something on your face. Come here. And I take my hand and I wipe across his forehead and smear out what I did.\nTRAVIS: Don't fucking touch me!\nLIAM: Sorry.\nTRAVIS: You're all cuddly in the morning and shit. God, get it together.\nLIAM: Sorry.\nTRAVIS: I lean over to Vex and I go, how do I look?\nLAURA: You look lovely, dear.\nTRAVIS: Damn right.\nSAM: I have questions for us, while Pike is looking up her spells. First question is: how on earth are we supposed to send a signal to the rest of the town when we're in a tunnel?\nLAURA: We can open it up.\nSAM: From where?\nLAURA: From here.\nTALIESIN: Once we're inside the castle, we'll be able to–\nMARISHA: I can Skywrite again.\nLAURA: You could Skywrite right now, as soon as we decide to start moving.\nMARISHA: I just need to move the boulders a bit.\nLAURA: Yeah. Open the rocks up. People start attacking the castle; we come from the other side, from within.\nSAM: Is that our plan? We're going to say, “Rebels, go,” wait a while, and then attack?\nTALIESIN: Not even wait a while. We'll go in.\nLAURA: Go in at the same time.\nLIAM: We throw the signal to the sky and go up this tunnel.\nSAM: Shouldn't we wait a little?\nLAURA: Wait like five minutes to let them rabble up and start running.\nSAM: Remember, last time I was supposed to create a diversion…\nLAURA: Yeah, but then you took down a whole house.\nTALIESIN: Well, we had a Grog.\nSAM: Believe me, I was amazing, but maybe we should incite the rebellion, wait a half hour, and then go.\nTALIESIN: Let's see if we can keep civilian casualties to a reasonably small amount.\nMARISHA: We're the most capable people in this town right now.\nSAM: Well, that's another question. We are. Does one of us need to go out there and lead the rebels?\nLAURA AND TALIESIN: No.\nTALIESIN: We're fine.\nSAM: What do you mean, no?\nMARISHA: They've got Yennan. He's awesome. He was a badass cleric.\nSAM: If he survived the night.\nTRAVIS: What if they don't take the rebels seriously because we're not with them? Maybe one of us should go.\nSAM: Maybe Pike should.\nTALIESIN: I think it's going to take all of us to defeat the Briarwoods.\nLAURA: I think we all need to go together.\nTALIESIN: Once the Briarwoods are gone, I think a lot of this will get a lot easier.\nTRAVIS: We could meet in the middle.\nSAM: I'm just saying, if Pike is fading on us, it might be best to send her out to lead the rebels.\nLAURA: No, she's not fading on us, you dick! She's coming with us.\nLIAM: Scanlan, we're going to make a leap of faith that Pike can stay.\nSAM: And if, in the horribly unfortunate scenario where she can't. Pike, can you leave us anything?\nLAURA: A Heroes' Fucking Feast.\nSAM: A potion. A spell. A prayer. A symbol. A “siggle.” Anything?","response":"DM: A sigil."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh. Oh, a sigil. I said it wrong.\nLIAM: Oh, prepare to be GIF'd, Mercer.\nASHLEY: Wow. There's some amazing– just a side note, there's one called Heal that can heal a person 70 hit points.","response":"DM: True."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Just like that.\nLAURA: That's pretty awesome.","response":"DM: So, Heroes' Feast, Heal. You've got to pick one."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Heroes' Feast!\nSAM: Heroes' Feast raises all of our hit points higher.\nLIAM: Way to humble-brag, Pike.\nLAURA: It makes us more badass.\nASHLEY: Yeah, let's do the Heroes' Feast, then.\nMARISHA: We're going to eat up? Fuck yeah.\nMARISHA: Yes, I believe we need to go shopping.\nLAURA: You needed one more. You had one more, I thought.","response":"DM: She has one more. It's being used right now. She'd purchased two before you left."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Pike, you wouldn't happen to have a thousand gold-worth chalice on you, would you?\nLIAM: Only astrally.\nMARISHA: Never mind.","response":"DM: I would think probably not."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Don't worry about it.","response":"DM: You hand over the chalice to Pike. Pike, you take the chalice and you set it down before you. You mark a symbol in the dirt in the center of this tunnel in the shape of a giant rectangular table. You take your holy symbol, remove it from your neck, and thrust it into the ground at the head of the table. With that, dust kicks up as seemingly out of nowhere, this giant table and feast just (fwoosh) rises."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my god, is it a holy feast? Do we all do holy damage now?","response":"DM: No, but holy shit, it's delicious."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Best line of the night!","response":"DM: Benches around and available. You all sit around it and dig into the most delightful mid-tunnel, cold sub-castle breakfast you've ever had."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ice cream.\nLAURA: Give me that pencil.","response":"DM: So you guys all, for the next 24 hours, have advantage on wisdom saving throws, and I believe it's 2d6? Is that what it was, Marisha?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 2d10 or 2d8.","response":"DM: I'll look it up right here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Wisdom advantage.\nLAURA: I think it's 2d12.\nMARISHA: 2d12?","response":"DM: Heroes' Feast. Nope, 2d10. Everyone, roll 2d10 and add that temporary hit points to your HP value. That includes you, too, Pike. So roll 2d10 and that's temporary hit points on top of your regular hit points. Meaning once those go away, they cannot be healed back."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Still not cracking a hundred.\nTALIESIN: Nice!\nSAM: And advantage on wisdom saves.\nMARISHA: And we're immune to fear.","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Seriously?\nMARISHA: And poison, I think.","response":"DM: Yep. You're immune to poison."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Immune to fear, immune to poison, and immune to what else?","response":"DM: And you get advantage on all wisdom saving throws. Heroes' Feast, motherfucker!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Immune to fear, and what was it?","response":"DM: Immune to fear and poison. Oh, such a good spell. Very expensive, but damn if it hasn't been clutch."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to move out some rocks. Just enough where I can peek out. Are we ready to go?\nSAM: Go? Go where? What?\nLAURA: To do this!\nMARISHA: I'm just going to start this. We can talk as we go.\nSAM: You've got to go outside first.\nMARISHA: I'm going outside.\nSAM: Okay.\nMARISHA: I'm going outside. Is it still rainy?","response":"DM: It is not raining, currently. The sky is still cloudy and dark."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Still cloudy?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, so I take the clouds and I darken them and do a giant de Rolo crest that expands over the whole city.","response":"DM: Okay, so with Grog's help, you move some of the rocks out of the way. You get a visual of the sky. You lean out, focus, cast your Skywrite spell– mark that spell off– and as you coalesce the clouds to be extremely dark and to form the de Rolo crest symbol in the sky. As that happens, you begin to see, about two minutes later, little beacon lights begin to ignite across the city: lanterns and torches being lit. It looks like, as it is probably an hour past dawn, that the surviving remainder of the Whitestone rebellion is raring itself to attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should have sung “One Day More.”\nTALIESIN: (sighs)\nMARISHA: To the de Rolos.\nSAM: To the de Rolos.\nMARISHA: To Whitestone.\nTALIESIN: To Whitestone.\nLAURA: To Vox Machina.\nMARISHA: To Vox Machina.","response":"DM: You may raise your glass and drink if you'd like, Ashley."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh, thanks!\nMARISHA: Do that Ben and Jerry's pint.","response":"DM: As you guys finish your drink, the Heroes' Feast slowly sinks back into the dirt, leaving the empty tunnel before you. The slight cold sound of drifting wind through the now freshly barricaded rock exit of the secret passageway begins to reach your ears. What do you wish to do?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do we want to check the wall?\nLIAM: I'm taking point. I want to check out that wall that I sat right in front of.\nSAM: Let's all go down the tunnel.\nLIAM: Yep. Come on, everyone.\nMARISHA: I light up my hands for light.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Very quietly down the tunnel.","response":"DM: Using the veritable torchlight from Keyleth's burning hands, you guys press down the hallway, Vax taking point. Eventually, you get to the end of the hallway. There's a portion of the stone wall that has been chiseled out. It's not very smooth; it's rough in the way it was constructed, but there is definitely about a foot-thick wall that would go to the right and left of you in the dirt that has been chiseled and broken through to reveal this passageway that you guys are traversing. Immediately on the other side of this opening, now that you have a better look at it, it looks to be some sort of stone sculpture or statue of some kind."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (sneezes)\nLAURA AND MATT: Bless you.","response":"DM: You see what looks to be the back side of some armored soldier, but it's all carved from some sort of marble. At a closer look, too, Percy, you see it's carved from the white stone that is actually mined in this–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do I recognize this part of the passage?","response":"DM: You do. This statue is one of the large things used to hide this exit, and it is normally shoved out of the way. There are a few other boxes immediately adjacent to it, and from what little bit you can glance past it, it looks like this section is used for storage of some kind and is filled with whatever random crates and whatever needed to be placed down here to keep it out of the way."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can someone check to make sure that it's just a statue?\nMARISHA: Can I do an arcana check to see?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: If it's magical? Magic trap?\nLIAM: I'm going to perception it. 20 on perception.\nMARISHA: Natural 20. Making up for those fucking ones.","response":"DM: There you go. As you step up and inspect the back of the statue, the stonework is very well done, and there is a very, very faint magical essence to this statue. It's so miniscule, and the only reason you're able to pick it up is you're so fine-tuned to seeking out that presence. It doesn't have a specific form; it doesn't have a specific school of magic applied to it. It just has a general, faint magical aura."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is it carved out of the rock?","response":"DM: It's carved out of the white stone."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Got you. But it's not magically trapped?","response":"DM: Correct. It doesn't appear to have any sort of strong magical presence for a specific purpose."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And if we touch it, we're not going to be possessed or something.","response":"DM: You don't think so."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't think so.\nLIAM: I silently signal to everyone, and I slowly stealth around the statue to check out the room.","response":"DM: Okay. It's all pressed against the wall. The widest gap is about that wide. You're going to have to push or shove things out of the way. All the crates are pushed up against it, blocking the whole exit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it too big for you? Do you need maybe somebody stronger?\nLIAM: I reach out past my sister and pat him on the shoulder.\nTRAVIS: Yes?\nLAURA: (whispering) I think you're up.\nTRAVIS: Where? Up where?\nLAURA: I think you need to move the fucking statue.\nTRAVIS: Oh!\nLAURA: Quietly.\nTRAVIS: (whispering) Oh. And I gently start to push the statue out of the way.","response":"DM: Make a strength check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no! Really?\nTRAVIS: That's a one.","response":"DM: Natural one?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm sorry.","response":"DM: Grog cracks his fingers and grins, stepping up. Goes to push the statue, and then pop! Something in your lower back gives, and (groans)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Peacock a little more for us, please.","response":"DM: The air escapes your lungs, and it's been a long time since this injury has crept up, but you threw your back out a little."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I slide down and go, you know, I'm so tired of (groans) taking all the glory. Why don't you guys–\nLAURA: Trinket? Trinket tries to–","response":"DM: Trinket, who, at this point in time, by the way guys, takes up a large portion of the tunnel–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, he wants to get the fuck out of here.","response":"DM: Pushes past you guys and turns around and puts his rump against it and starts backing up into it. (moans) Go ahead and roll a d20."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Please defeat this door.\nMARISHA: Fucking doors!\nLIAM: (whispering) Can you please fix Grog's back?\nTALIESIN: Doors of Whitestone.\nLAURA: Doors of fucking Whitestone! Oh god.","response":"DM: Add two to the roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Only two?!","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't add his full strength? It doesn't fucking matter, because I rolled a three.\nMARISHA: Doors.\nTALIESIN: Curse you, doors!\nSAM: I've got this, guys.\nLIAM: Wait, before we use– listen. This could potentially be humiliating for all of us. Before we expend any of our arcane abilities, please let us all at least try and fail before you take out the Hand.\nTALIESIN: Let's all push.\nLAURA: As much as we can.\nSAM: Wait, why are we pushing this thing?\nLIAM: Let's do the one and a half elf push, shall we? You, you, and me.\nLAURA: And Percy.\nTALIESIN: I'll join.\nSAM: I will push, as well.\nLIAM: All the average-shaped people.\nLAURA: I'm rolling my giant foam dice for this.\nSAM: I'm helping.\nMARISHA: He's helping.\nSAM: I am not helping.\nMARISHA: Ooh, I rolled a 19!\nLIAM: One, eight.\nSAM: 11.\nMARISHA: Wait, is this just a strength check?","response":"DM: Yeah, adding your strength."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Straight strength?\nLAURA: One.\nMARISHA: 21.\nTALIESIN: 12.\nMARISHA: (grunts)","response":"DM: As you give it a good solid try, the force of you guys combined; there is just a lot of weight pressed up against this statue with the crates on the other side. This storage room is very full, and you find Vox Machina, for all of its journeys, battles, victories, and celebratory events, bested by a room of clutter. Pike, did you want to give it a shot?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah.\nMARISHA: I turn around and I'm still pushing.\nSAM: Wait, Pike's going to do this?","response":"DM: Okay, Pike. Roll a d20 and add your strength modifier."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on, Pike.\nSAM: Doors, man.\nMARISHA: Charge at it.\nLAURA: This is like the lid of a jar; everybody's loosened it up, and Pike's going to–\nSAM: What?\nASHLEY: 19.","response":"DM: Plus your strength modifier?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I rolled an 18 and my strength modifier is one.\nLIAM: Somebody draw it. Please draw it.","response":"DM: She steps up and centers herself. Sets her shield to the side, puts her mace down, closes her eyes, puts her hands on the statue and just (grunts) begins to shove and push. As she does, you guys hear (stone scraping noise)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Seriously?\nTALIESIN: I could have done that.","response":"DM: The crates begin to push and move out of the way, and she pushes the statue a good six feet ahead, pushing some of it out of the way, leaving a little bit of opening and a visual walkway into this basement area."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Look at that.\nMARISHA: It must be nice to have the strength of Sarenrae.\nLAURA: Pike, you saved the day. Again.\nSAM: Mrs. Shorthalt, you are amazing.\nASHLEY: Whoa, Scanlan.\nTALIESIN: Well, fine.","response":"DM: Trinket gives a (grumpy grunt)."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Pike, will you carry me over the threshold?\nLIAM: Wait! I fistbump Pike, pop my hood up, and then quietly go into the room.\nLAURA: Not yet!\nLIAM: Yeah! I'm the best person to do this.\nTRAVIS: Can I have Trinket step on my lower back, please?\nLAURA: Trinket's really good at that.","response":"DM: Trinket is really good at massages. Trinket begins going, (grunts) stepping on you (cracking) and you hear–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (groans) Thank god.","response":"DM: I'm going to have you roll a stealth check–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 29 for stealth.","response":"DM: With disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Disadvantage?","response":"DM: Because of Grog's moaning at the massage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's fine. That balances out, and my first roll was a 29 total.\nLIAM: Can you help me understand the makeup of it again? You said two passages– one to the left, one to the right– and a chamber directly ahead, between them?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I know we've got two paths, but he said there's a room, as well.","response":"DM: Here, this will be a good perspective for you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, you just happen to have the room drawn?","response":"DM: That's where you guys came through."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah?","response":"DM: And see this path here?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: And here. And there are cells on this side."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is there anything good in the storage room that we're in?","response":"DM: Oh, you're in the storage room?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, I start opening up crates.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's not great. Eight.","response":"DM: There's a lot of broken building materials."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 18.","response":"DM: 18? Okay. Looking around, you see there's work materials. There's pickaxes, there's crowbars, there's things that are used in various tool-based means throughout the uses of a castle. Most of them are for grounds repair and things like that; nothing particularly interests you. There are a few crates that have residual whitestone in them, but it appears that most of it has been used or taken elsewhere."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Like whitestone dust?","response":"DM: Like dust and small rocks here and there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I gather some up in a bag?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, I pick up a few pieces too.","response":"DM: Okay. You, seeing both of those paths–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So both paths, and there's a room closer to me, right?","response":"DM: Yeah, around the way to your left, you see that's the source of a little bit of sconce torchlight."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I stop moving entirely and I just wait.","response":"DM: “Hello?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And can I hear anything besides that? There's nothing else I hear besides that in this room?","response":"DM: From what you can tell, no."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: There's no dim light or anything?","response":"DM: The only dim light is coming from around that corner, from the source of where that sound seemed to come."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. I should be able to see, then, if there's dim light. Up to 60 feet.","response":"DM: Right. Nothing immediately in your visual perspective. If you go all the way to the edge, you can look past the corner if you want."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. I slowly back up away from that and creep up the hall and stop at the corner before it turns and I just lean my head out and I listen.","response":"DM: Okay. Perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 27.","response":"DM: Okay. Listening for a second, you hear what sounds like some shifting, like a body shifting over some sort of low crumbling. Sounds almost like grasses or hay or some sort of soft bedding is being shifted a little bit. You hear a clink of metal of some kind, you're not sure quite what the source is, and a couple of other small shifting and grinding sounds of metal. Comes to a halt."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Got it. So I tiptoe all the way back to everybody and say, listen. Stop doing that. Stop. There's two passageways up the way. I think we're in some sort of dungeon–\nTALIESIN: I could probably confirm this.","response":"DM: Very much so. This is where you woke up, where Cassandra pulled you–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This is absolutely the dungeon.\nLIAM: I had surmised as much. There's possibly an old person in one, and then sounds of something, so both of the chambers are occupied. I came back to confer with you instead of going off on my own because that gets me in trouble.\nLAURA: Hey, thank you so much.\nLIAM: One time only.\nSAM: Let's go talk to the old prisoner.\nLIAM: What do you want to do?\nMARISHA: Are we sure they're prisoners?\nLIAM: Do you want to talk to the possibly old person with the crazy eyes thing?\nTRAVIS: Shouldn't we ask Percy what he wants to do?","response":"DM: You right now are staring off into space, because you recall the last time you were here you woke up in a cell next to a cell that contained a pile of bodies of previously related members of your family before Cassandra ushered you out."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I would like to start making my way in that direction.","response":"DM: Okay. So as you guys are having this conversation, Percy just starts walking–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Percy, you probably want to take out one of those contraptions of yours.\nLAURA: Wait, before he goes I cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone.","response":"DM: Okay. Everyone who wishes to be stealthy can be stealthy."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm rolling along with Percival.\nTALIESIN: I'm being stealthy.","response":"DM: Okay. Everyone roll stealth."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Me too, I'm super stealthy.","response":"DM: We'll keep with your consistent roll, currently."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 15.","response":"DM: Okay. With plus ten?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: That's with plus ten.\nLIAM: It's 30 this time.\nMARISHA: 21.\nLAURA: Add ten! Because I cast Pass Without a Trace.\nTALIESIN: 21.\nLIAM: Oh, 40 this time. Only with her.","response":"DM: Only it would be like (whoosh) what'd you get, Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 26.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys all move as a group forward. Pike, what'd you get? Yeah, roll your stealth, girl. Plus ten to it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But plus ten!\nLIAM: Can I give her seven of mine?","response":"DM: No. You guys push down the left hallway or the right one?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm heading towards whichever cell had been mine.","response":"DM: The cell that would've been yours would be kind of on the opposite side of the room from you, on the other side. The fastest way would be taking the left path towards the light source."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The left path.","response":"DM: Okay. So you guys head that direction, kind of following Percy–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: That's not the direction of the voice.\nLAURA: Yes, it is.\nSAM: Oh, it is?","response":"DM: Yeah. You move towards the light. You guys turn around the corner and look. Not in the cell you were in, but across the way, because there are six cells, three on each side of the hallway facing each other, and on the far cell on the outside-wall side of it, you see there's a torch sconce that is lit and just slowly crackling. It's almost reached ember period, like it's about to be changed out, probably. And inside you see, sitting just squat on the ground, in a cell by herself, this woman facing away, back up against the bars and that's all you can see."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Drawing a blade just in case.\nLAURA: As I approach I put my finger over my mouth and look at her. Can she see us?\nLIAM: Looking away.","response":"DM: She's facing away from you guys, her back is up against the bars. She's kinda–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Psst. Oi. Hello.\nTALIESIN: Shh.","response":"DM: Turns her head and looks over, and it's the first time you see her face. Much older woman, probably in her early seventies or so, but seventies living in a not very– seventy years in a hard life, so very deep, sunken wrinkles. The skin is very weathered. Her hair is mostly whitish-gray with a little bit of you can see remaining reds and browns in it, at some point she might've had much brighter-colored hair. Her clothing is pretty ragged, and she leans over and looks to you guys, squinting her eyes in the darkness."}
{"prompt":"SAM: If you want to get out of here, don't speak loudly.\nLAURA: Who are you?\nSAM: We're here to help.","response":"DM: She's still kind of looking out into the darkness. She can't see you guys really. She just hears your voices."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Who are you?","response":"DM: “Who are you?” She's being very guarded right now and very spooked."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: In the darkness, I hand, stupidly, my Flametongue dagger to Scanlan again and push him forward with it.\nSAM: I hold it up to my face. I grin a big grin to her and I say, hello. We're friends. We're here to bust you out of this place. Will you tell us who you are?","response":"DM: “I'm Gloria. Gloria Cyn.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Gloria Cyn?","response":"DM: “How'd you find your way in here?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We are ninjas.","response":"DM: She looks very confused at you. “Are you friend or foe? Do you work with the Briarwoods?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, we are against the Briarwoods and all they stand for. We're here to save you, the prisoners, the village. Everyone we can.","response":"DM: Do all of you step forward at this point, or is it just you?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just him. Mr. High Charisma.\nSAM: I am not alone. I have friends with me. Some of whom look quite scary, so don't be alarmed if a bear stands right behind me.","response":"DM: “A bear?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's a good bear. It's the best kind of bear.\nLAURA: He's the cutest.","response":"DM: “Who is that?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: That's my friend Vex. Vex, come forward.\nLAURA: I walk up a little bit behind Scanlan and I insight check her to see what the fuck is going on.","response":"DM: Okay, roll insight."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't know, they've all been betraying me! Don't you. Oh, that's good! 24.","response":"DM: 24, okay. I mean, she's in a cell in a dungeon and looks to be fairly spooked but also guarded. Not much to read beyond the fact that she's an old woman in a dungeon."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No?","response":"DM: I mean, she's definitely staying guarded in the circumstance, but you're not picking up any sort of strange animosity."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Why have you been locked up?\nLAURA: A week, that's it?\nTALIESIN: I would say it's almost safer for her down here for now.\nLAURA: Yeah. So here's the thing.\nSAM: We're great with old people.\nTRAVIS: They don't take prisoners.\nLAURA: There's a lot of violence that's going to happen.\nSAM: We should unlock that, maybe we should unlock this cage.\nTALIESIN: No.\nLAURA: No. We should keep her in here for now.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, they don't take prisoners, they don't take prisoners. Why isn't she fucking dead? Or undead?\nSAM: She can run out the tunnel that we came in.\nMARISHA: Yeah, why don't we unlock her and just let her book for it?\nLIAM: Wait. If we destroy the Briarwoods, it will be no trouble to come down here and let anyone out who's down here. If she's who she says she is, we don't know.\nSAM: Madam. Good madam. When you were brought into the castle, can you tell us anything about where you were brought? Were you brought before the queen– she is a queen, right?\nLAURA: No, she's a lady.\nSAM: Lady. Were you brought before the Lady, and if so, in what room? Where was it? How big was it? How many guards were in there?\nSAM: You have beautiful eyes. Did those eyes see anything in that grand throne room? Entrances or exits? Large windows? Anything?\nTALIESIN: I know all of them. I did live here.\nSAM: Oh, fuck. Never mind, Matt. “Were there any guards? Many guards? Lots of guards?”","response":"DM: “There were many guards. I'd heard of dark things happening in this castle, but when I was escorted through, I saw things in the courtyard, shambling things, things that should not be alive. Tens, dozens. I did not feel right at that moment, and then, well, my fate was brought into this terrible cell.” She kind of looks about."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Has anybody been coming down and feeding you?","response":"DM: “Every now and then.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Not on a regular basis?","response":"DM: “Every day or so they bring enough to subsist on.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: As she's talking, I'm going to see if there's any sort of arcana or magical incantation on her, or any sort of possession. Is that something I can check for?","response":"DM: Do you have the Detect Magic spell?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: No.\nMARISHA: I do.\nSAM: Can I just do an arcana check, or is that not–","response":"DM: I mean, what are you–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't know.","response":"DM: Arcana's more inspecting a close area to see if there is the nature of an arcane enchantment or something on it, you don't actually like sense it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Nothing.\nLAURA: Can't detect magic?\nMARISHA: I can dispel magic.\nLAURA: Try it.\nTALIESIN: No, because that's a spell.\nMARISHA: It's a spell. It's a 3rd-level spell.\nSAM: She's fine. Let's leave her.\nMARISHA: I mean, I can do it.\nTRAVIS: Why is she not dead? Why is she not undead?\nTALIESIN: They were going to feed her to something.\nMARISHA: Yeah, they were going to eat her.\nSAM: Let's feed her to Trinket and go on.\nLIAM: They're not much, but I have rations and a waterskin. I toss them through the bars of her cell.","response":"DM: She grabs them as soon as they come through the cell and grasps them to herself."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We'll be back.","response":"DM: “You're very kind.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do you know if anyone else is in the dungeon down here with you?","response":"DM: “I have not seen or heard anyone else. Occasional wails, soft, mournful moans, but I stay quiet. I stay very still.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hide in the corner. Stay quiet.","response":"DM: “Would you please let me out?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, you're fucking staying in that cell, and if things go bad upstairs it won't matter if you're in there or not.\nSAM: If you please.\nTALIESIN: There are things upstairs that we can't protect you from that we are going to deal with first.\nLIAM: And there are creatures on the road and in the woods and quite frankly you're safer right now. If we do what we have come here to do, we will come back for you.\nTALIESIN: There is war outside right now.\nLAURA: Don't you worry.","response":"DM: “If there is war, then that's the time to leave, when there is distraction.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can you raise a blade? Can you fight?","response":"DM: “I can run. I made it up here north, didn't I? I've lived in these lands for quite some time, I know how to survive.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We can come back for her.","response":"DM: “Please. Please don't leave me. I don't know what's going on.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is awful.\nTRAVIS: Is it? Leave her.\nMARISHA: Vax, you're the only one who can pick the lock. We don't have keys. I'm assuming she's locked in there, right?","response":"DM: You can check the cell door."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's leave her. Ma'am, you must believe me when we say you are much safer here than above.\nLIAM: Her fate is intertwined with our own. If she leaves, she has a very good chance of being killed. If we go forward and succeed, we come back and she lives. If we go forward and she dies, she's where she is. This is the best place for her.","response":"DM: “At least take the fate into my own hands. I don't mean any wrong here, but I have no reason to really trust you, either. How can I show my trust, how can I–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You can be quiet.","response":"DM: “I can be quiet. Do not leave me here to waste and die. What if you don't succeed? What if you fall in whatever folly you're making away into this castle for and I waste away down here myself? Please.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I've just given you food and water. We'll be back within 24 hours. Come on. We're going.\nTRAVIS: Hold up.","response":"DM: “Please.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ma'am. Here. I'm giving you a magical whip. It will protect you against anyone who comes down here. Just hold it up and it will chase away any demons.","response":"DM: You're the only one who's out of the light now?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah.\nLIAM: He was the first one out of the light.","response":"DM: Right, but everyone else is still in the shadow, all these voices coming at her."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: She can see me because I went down towards Scanlan.","response":"DM: Okay. She steps a little closer to you as you're holding the whip out, and she grabs your hand with her left hand and kind of pulls it in and goes, “Please. Don't leave me here. I can fend for my own. Just don't leave me here.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I step forward now behind Scanlan. Super fucking intimidating. If things go well upstairs, we'll be back. If when we leave, you make a peep, you won't ever again.","response":"DM: Make an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Damn, Grog.\nLIAM: Roll intimidation.\nTRAVIS: 14.","response":"DM: She shrinks back. She still hasn't looked away from you, and she kind of looks at you for a second and (heavy sigh) sits down, frustrated, at the bottom of the cell and just, “Then go. Leave me. Useless.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (whispering) Let's check the other side.\nLIAM: Eat that lembas bread.\nSAM: I take the whip back.\nTRAVIS: Was it a magical whip or just a rope?\nLAURA: No, it was just his whip.\nTALIESIN: Let's check the other side.","response":"DM: Anything else you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No no no, there's something, I don't know what, I couldn't make out what I was hearing, it sounded like hay or grass moving, so I don't want to mess with that.\nMARISHA: Someone's sleeping.\nTRAVIS: I think it was the straw on the bottom of her cell, right?\nLIAM: No, that was her passage. There's another passage to presumably another set of cells. So I will skip along quietly 20 feet ahead of you all. Try to see.\nSAM: Old people love us.\nLAURA: We're the worst.","response":"DM: You skitter around the corner. Go ahead and make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 21.","response":"DM: Okay. Looking about the cells, they all appear to be empty. You do catch a couple of rats skittering through some of the brush. Nothing that really is the source of that scraping metal sound."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is the second room?","response":"DM: You go around the way and there's another set of cells."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Nobody else in the other cells."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: This is where I heard something before.","response":"DM: You heard it echoing around the other hallway, so it could be amorphously from the same source that she came from, or near the cell."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And my perception. Vex, come up here and look around.\nLAURA: I sneak up.\nLIAM: I don't see anything, but I feel like something's here.\nLAURA: Can we sense anything?\nSAM: By the way, how long has this all taken?","response":"DM: Since you left the symbol up there?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: The tunnel, left the lady, the tunnel. Since we've incited the rebellion.","response":"DM: 20 minutes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Jesus. We've got to start cooking, guys.\nLIAM: Pike, do you, is there anything here, do you sense anything in this room?\nASHLEY: (sighs) No, I feel weird about this old woman.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Me, too.","response":"DM: Yeah, there is, past her cells, a–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yay, map.\nLAURA: We're not getting to see it yet.","response":"DM: Now that you've been through this whole thing, you can see now–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ta-da!\nTALIESIN: Let's memorize where we're all going to die.","response":"DM: She's in this cell over here. You've come around here and you can see there are two cells this way, a cell this way, and then these sets of cells. There is a stairway that curves upward–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, which one was the old lady in?","response":"DM: This one right there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think we should let her out.\nASHLEY: Did you guys give her something to eat?\nLAURA: Yeah, we gave her food and water.\nLIAM: I gave her food and water.\nASHLEY: Did she eat it?\nLIAM: She scrabbled at it.","response":"DM: She brought it to her, but she didn't eat it immediately, no."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Because she's not hungry, because she hasn't been in there for a while.\nASHLEY: We didn't see her eat it?\nLAURA: No.\nMARISHA: Is there, do we see anyone else in any of the cells?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: At this point, I grab my sister and I say, Come on, we're going to check the cells. And we look at every single one of them.","response":"DM: Okay, you go through every cell. There is nobody living in them. You do see a few of the cells have long-decomposed corpses. Piles of bones, mostly picked clean by the rats or whatever creatures live in here. But from your best knowledge of decomposition through your experiences, nothing fresher than like the past year, maybe."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I walk back up to the old woman. Not hungry or thirsty, I take it?\nASHLEY: I'm going to go with Grog.\nTRAVIS: Keep you well-fed here, do they?","response":"DM: “No. But if you eat it all at once, you have nothing to keep you over until the next time.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, have a little nibble.","response":"DM: She gives you a strange look."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Have a little nibble.","response":"DM: Takes some of the rations and breaks it off."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It's good.","response":"DM: “It's not the finest of stone fish, but it'll do.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Cooking with Grog!\nTALIESIN: Old people love us.\nLAURA: Yeah, we're just the worst to old people.","response":"DM: “Why are you so spiteful, giant man?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Because I don't trust you, old woman.\nASHLEY: Can I quietly prick a little hole into my palm, just so I can start bleeding a little bit? Just very tiny?","response":"DM: Could I ask what for?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What was that?","response":"DM: Could I ask what for?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's a great idea.","response":"DM: Unfortunately, your form here is incorporeal, there is no blood flow from your current body."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Fuck. I just want to see if she's a vampire.\nLIAM: In Vasselheim there is.","response":"DM: Back in Vasselheim there is, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Grog, do you get any ideas watching her do that?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I fucking bite into the meat of my hand because I see what she's trying to do.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Just (chomp).","response":"DM: “What's wrong with you?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Drip a little. Oh no. Some nice type AB. Right here. On tap.","response":"DM: She turns her head curiously and looks disgusted and disturbed by this display."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No?","response":"DM: Very confused."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Clean blood. Feel yourself tempted?","response":"DM: “I know not which madness has taken you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Let's get the fuck out of here.\nLIAM: We're making asses of ourselves.","response":"DM: “Please. Please, I implore you, just open these gates. Let me fare for my own fate.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes, the answer to that is no. We'll be back, I'm going to go creep up the stairs.","response":"DM: “She. You. You, please.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I can't pick a lock. I mean, I can try.\nLIAM: I'm moving towards those stairs.","response":"DM: Okay, Vax walks towards the stairs. The rest of you guys?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Doors and old people.\nLAURA: I'm going to act like I'm trying to pick the lock and help her. But I'm going to not try very hard. I'm putting on a show for her. Oh, this is a really difficult lock.\nLAURA: And then what?","response":"DM: “You turn it this way. You don't have the proper tools for this–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I snap the thing into the lock. Oh no. I knew I shouldn't have done that.","response":"DM: “Foolish girl!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I just don't know what I'm doing, but I will be back with someone who does.","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Perception?\nMARISHA: Perception?\nSAM: Oh shit, because she's going to turn into something.\nLAURA: Oh, that's really good. 26.","response":"DM: 26. When she went up and grabbed the lock with you, her hands grabbed the lock. You only felt one hand."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh my god, it's Ripley! Oh my god, it's Ripley! Sorry.","response":"DM: You're not there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm saying that as Marisha. Not as Keyleth. Saying that as a person.","response":"DM: The worst."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm sorry.","response":"DM: But anyway."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Shush, you don't know anything, shut up.","response":"DM: We are going to leave it there–"}
{"prompt":"(shouting)\nLAURA: Oh my gosh.\nASHLEY: Wait, who's Ripley?\nLAURA: Oh my gosh.\nLIAM: They mostly come out at night. Mostly.\nLAURA: Ashley, we're going to have to tell you so much.\nTALIESIN: Oh my god.\nASHLEY: I'll try to catch up, too.","response":"DM: So now Whitestone Castle has been infiltrated, the real path to the seeming end is on. We will continue this next week Thursday."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wait, we're stopping?","response":"DM: Yeah, we're stopping."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You've got to go to sleep.\nLAURA: You've got to get picked up in like an hour.","response":"DM: When do you have to be on set, Ashley?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: My pick up is at 5AM.\nMARISHA: Oh my god, Ashley.\nTALIESIN: So what time is it there right now?\nMARISHA: It's one, no, 2AM there.\nASHLEY: It's almost 2AM.\nLAURA: Ashley!","response":"DM: Ashley… See that's, that's a true friend player right there, guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's just pick-ups, right?","response":"DM: I know. Well thank you, Ashley, for joining us. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Ah, shit.\nLAURA: Ashley, we love you.\nTALIESIN: Love you so much.\nMARISHA: We love you, Ashley, please come back next week.","response":"DM: Yeah, let us know if you can make next week, please."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. Bye!\nMARISHA and LAURA: Bye!\nTALIESIN: Bye, darling!\nLIAM: Can that astral connection hold?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can that astral connection hold?\nASHLEY: I know, hopefully, hopefully.","response":"DM: Have a good night. Good luck."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Love you guys.\nLAURA and MARISHA: (air kisses)","response":"DM: And you guys, thank you so much for coming and watching our craziness every week. Once again, blown away by the generosity of all the Critters and folk from our Critmas last week. That episode will be up tomorrow, and for those who didn't get a chance to see the ridiculous generosity and absurdity that is you guys in all of your amazement, check it out. And thank you for giving to charity, thank you for everything you guys do, and thank you for watching us be silly and rolling dice every week."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And comic comes out on Wednesday.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh wow, Wednesday?\nMARISHA: This coming up Wednesday.\nTALIESIN: And your Spotify went up today.\nMARISHA: And yeah, go check out all of our playlists.","response":"DM: Rock it out."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: There'll be a fun playlist next week.\nLAURA: Oh, and I'm joining Monday Melee for Team Coco on Monday.","response":"DM: What?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: What?","response":"DM: That's awesome."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So I forgot to say that at the beginning. But yeah, it should be at like 11AM on Monday. 11:30, something like that.","response":"DM: That's awesome."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Check it out.","response":"DM: Check it out, follow her on Twitter."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, I'll put something out there.\nTALIESIN: On the Twitters.","response":"DM: Indeed. Well, guys, we'll see you next week, and is it Thursday yet?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fake helping.","response":"DM: Fake helping with the lock, much to her chagrin."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, and I had just snapped it off into the locks so that it's jammed it.\nLAURA: Oh, we'll be back. Don't worry.","response":"DM: She backs up and sits in the far corner of the prison cell and (huffs)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I look around. Has everyone left me?\nTRAVIS: The only people that are in the light–\nTRAVIS: She only saw me and–\nLAURA: Me and Scanlan.","response":"DM: And Scanlan, yeah. You all stepped out into the light. The rest of you stayed in the shadows."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nLAURA: I go and I find Scanlan.\nSAM: Oi.\nLAURA: So, question.\nSAM: Yes?\nLAURA: When you cast Seeming on us, our visual– if you made me look like a cow, would I seem like a cow when I bumped into you, or would I seem like a human?\nSAM: Are you asking me to make you into a cow right now?\nLAURA: No, I'm saying that if something was different–\nSAM: Because I think this is not the right time.\nLAURA: I think that old woman was doing something weird.\nSAM: Why do you think that?\nLAURA: Because she looked like she had full handses, but–\nSAM: Four hands?\nLAURA: Full.\nSAM: Oh, full hands. Okay.\nLAURA: Normal sort of hands, but I didn't feel them.\nSAM: You didn't feel them? You touched her hand and it just passed right through?\nLAURA: Her hand touched me, but it didn't–\nSAM: That's an illusion of some sort, yeah.\nLAURA: So she was doing some sort of–\nSAM: I don't know what, but yes. If I were to cast Seeming on us, or some other sort of magic, it would make us look one way but not feel that way.\nLAURA: I guess it's good that we left her, then.\nSAM: She's a caster of some sort?\nLAURA: I don't know.\nTRAVIS: Can you dispel Seeming?\nSAM: Should we go find out?\nLAURA: I don't know.\nTRAVIS: How would we do that?\nLAURA: Can you dispel Seeming?\nMARISHA: Do you have a Dispel Magic on you right now?\nSAM: I have– No.\nMARISHA: Oh my god, I do!\nSAM: Well.\nMARISHA: I learned it.\nSAM: Oh, Keyleth?\nTALIESIN: Are we calling everyone over for this conversation?\nSAM: I think we should.\nTRAVIS: Away from her.\nLAURA: Yeah, I'm far away from her now.\nSAM: That prisoner over there is casting magic of some sort.\nLAURA: I think she had Seeming cast on her. I don't know if she did it herself or if– well, I don't think she was what she appeared to be.\nTALIESIN: Do we want to waste power on somebody who's…\nSAM: What if she's–\nTRAVIS: An early warning system?\nSAM: Yeah, what if she's a guard?\nMARISHA: What if she's Lady Briarwood? Like what we were saying? That's what I'm most afraid of.\nSAM: Well, then we should find out now and kill the shit out of her.\nTRAVIS: I vote for that.\nMARISHA: Well, before we do that, let's see who she is. I did come prepared, though, to dispel magic.\nLAURA: So you can do Dispel Magic?\nMARISHA: I learned it. I did.\nLAURA: Stay in the shadows, Keyleth, and cast it on her.\nTRAVIS: Percy, you're wearing what?\nTALIESIN: I'm wearing a hat of disguise so that I'm not immediately identifiable.\nTRAVIS: What are you in disguise as?\nLAURA: A dude in a hat.\nTALIESIN: Link from the Legend of Zelda. I don't know.\nSAM: Well, you've got to figure it out right now.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to figure it out right now. Just as a reasonable Whitestone peasant.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Terrible teeth.\nTALIESIN: Trying to blend in.","response":"DM: By comparison to this troop, you're some poor sap who got pulled along, but yeah. You are that one quest-giver in Warcraft that walks way too slow and the party is like, “Come on, move!” That's who you look like right now."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Before we dispel magic on her, should we have someone put her in their sights in case she gets a little funky monkey?\nMARISHA: She will be able to feel it.\nLAURA: Well, yeah. She'll look like she's not herself.\nTALIESIN: We could also just ask her to drop it.\nTRAVIS: We asked her who she was. She lied. A lot.\nTALIESIN: Well, we could ask her to drop the Seeming.\nMARISHA: She lied pretty well, too.\nTALIESIN: She did.\nSAM: I could go talk to her, and meanwhile she could be fiddling with her magic behind me.\nLAURA: Do it.\nMARISHA: You go talk to her. I'll be prepared.\nLAURA: I'll stay in the shadows with my arrow notched.\nTRAVIS: I'll stay with Scanlan in case things go wrong.\nMARISHA: I stay next to Vex.\nTALIESIN: I stay in the shadows.\nLIAM: How close together are the bars to this cell?","response":"DM: The bars are about four inches apart."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Four inches.\nLAURA: So my arrow will do much better than your dagger.\nLIAM: Well, no. I'm not saying for you not to, but would I be able to comfortably throw through?","response":"DM: Yeah!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, it's fine.","response":"DM: She'd have a little bit of cover."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shoot your arrow, too. Shoot your dagger. Whatever.\nMARISHA: Shoot your dagger?\nSAM: He doesn't shoot daggers\nLIAM: Passive-aggressive much?\nTRAVIS: With Scanlan, also.\nSAM: Oh, flanked by Grog. Yes.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Not looking friendly, neither.","response":"DM: Okay, and there is the one torch that's a little off to the side that gives a little bit of light into this one portion of the dungeon below here. She's sat out, into the shadows of the far corner, arms crossed. You can see a little bit of the light framing her form. You make out okay in the darkness this close as a gnome, but you can see that she's just hunched in the corner, huffing in frustration."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oi. Old lady. Listen. We said we were going to come back for you and release you when all was said and done, but we cannot make that promise if you don't tell us the complete truth. Now, we know that you're using magic of some sort. Tell us who you really are.","response":"DM: “I'm sorry, what?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We are smart little people. And big people.\nTRAVIS: Thank you.\nSAM: And we can sense that you are casting magic of some sort on yourself to disguise yourself. Now, I have some familiarity with this, so I make no judgment as to why, but please reveal your true self to us or else we cannot trust you and we will leave you here to rot and possibly die.\nTRAVIS: (whispered) Now.\nMARISHA: Now! I do it now!\nSAM: “Now, I do it now?”\nTRAVIS: Hopefully quieter than that.","response":"DM: As Keyleth, partially in the shadows– the form of Scanlan small enough to not really obscure her presence– but she nevertheless gestures in the air, recites beneath her words the forbidden druidic languages that coalesce the powers of nature around. At which point, there's a dull flash of energy within the cell. Some of the nearby straw on the ground gets blown away from her form from the general push of air the spell disperses and the impact."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Sorry, got a little squirrely on that one.","response":"DM: The grey hair, the tattered clothes all vanish, revealing beneath it a woman in her early mid-forties or so. Jet black hair pulled into a tight ponytail, but strings of it in front of her face. Still in disarray but nowhere near as wrecked as the previous visage you were presented with. She's wearing nice travel clothes with what looks like some sort of a long duster-like coat that is a little ragged. You can see there's a little stain from being down here for a while. As soon as this moment hits, she pushes back even further, pressing herself against the wall, arms to the side."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: There you are.\nSAM: I must say, you look way better like this.","response":"DM: “Happy?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Extremely.\nTRAVIS: Yes, I'd say so.\nSAM: Yes, so who are you for real?","response":"DM: “My name is Anna, and I would like to be set free, if you don't mind. I can be of assistance to you. I happen to know a lot of information about the people that currently reside within this castle.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: How would you know anything about them?","response":"DM: “Release me and I'll tell you.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You want to be set free?\nLAURA: Tell us and we'll release you.","response":"DM: “You've been so forthright in your interest in helping such an old and frail woman. How can I have any sort of guarantee of my safety should I give you the information you seek? You could very well slay me in this cell.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That might happen if you're not careful.\nMARISHA: What's Percy doing right now? Where's Percy?\nLAURA: Do you recognize her, Percy?\nTALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: You very much recognize her. You do notice, by the way, her right hand? The sleeve ends. There is no hand there. It is just a missing hand, and the left hand is visible."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: As far as we can see, unarmed? Right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Anna?","response":"DM: “Yes?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's be frank with each other. You have two options: either you are going to die in this cell– and I promise you, you will die in this cell– or you are going to convince us why you shouldn't. So I would start talking right now or I swear we will not leave this dungeon before you're dead.","response":"DM: Roll an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's pretty good.\nTALIESIN: 16.","response":"DM: 16, okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And just as he finishes talking, I throw a dagger a foot away from her head in the wall.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You gave her a fucking dagger? And then it flashes back to you, right?","response":"DM: So the dagger which is thrown (whoosh) hits the stone wall next to her and jams itself between two of the stone bricks and gets wedged there for a second. She looks over for a second, reaches up for it and grabs the hilt as it vanishes in a puff of smoke."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You are so fucking lucky it did that.","response":"DM: She leans forward and stands up and steps into the light, and you have a better look of her now, and her face is a little weathered from travel. You can see she definitely doesn't appear to be nobleborn, at least. She's by no means a homely looking individual, but you can see she's seen the world, or elements of it, to have those dark lines at the sides of her face, whether it be from smiles or frowning. She steps into the light and looks to you, this peasant individual making these threats, and seems partially shaken but keeping her composure in the face of such threats. She says, “Well, for one thing, I've been here with them for the past five years. I helped them reestablish their current social control of this city when they left it a pile of flames and rubble. And their little experiment beneath the castle? I was one of their chief scientific designers.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Tell us about the experiments beneath the castle.","response":"DM: (chuckles) “You'll have to ask Sylas or Delilah for that. I don't have all the details or the reasons behind it, other than the process I was brought in to construct.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I see if she's lying?","response":"DM: You can. Make an insight check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Not great.\nTALIESIN: That's a number.\nMARISHA: It is a number. 16.","response":"DM: 16? Okay. You get the sense that she's telling the truth. You're not quite sure how far off the truth, but there doesn't seem to be any sort of bald-faced deception in her voice, at this point. She speaks with a confidence and a brusqueness of a person who is frustrated by the circumstance and has no other choice.  \"I wasn't interested in their zealotry or the whispered dealings, just the challenge behind the construction. I enjoy challenge. Challenge that pays, well, (chuckles) I enjoy that even more.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Question two: What are you doing down here, really?","response":"DM: “I'm down here because my work is done and I wish not to linger with an impending battle. I don't choose sides; I merely let them fight while I live another day far, far away. I wouldn't have gotten this far dealing with the people I've dealt with in the past if I had chosen to stick around under such circumstances, so I tried to leave. It appears Anders saw me packing and decided to gain a little favor by turning me in, so they threw me down here, told me to wait out the rest of the experiment, at least until the ziggurat was complete. So here I am, living amongst rats in a cell for over a week. That's my reward.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How did you lose the hand?","response":"DM: “Experiments can be dangerous, sometimes. I dabble with chemicals and alchemical reagents that can be miscalculated, and I paid a price that will be an ever-present reminder until I can find a way to fix it. And there are ways.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are you looking for ways to get back at the Briarwoods?","response":"DM: “Based on the way they've treated me here and their possible intent to not even keep up their end of the bargain now that I'm free to walk away? Perhaps.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Can you lead us to Cassandra de Rolo?","response":"DM: She turns her head with a curious look. “I could, yes. Why do you ask?” She looks at you very intently."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That may be what your life is worth.","response":"DM: “So. What else do you wish to know? What else do you need, even, to get me out from behind these bars? Because I'm growing very uncomfortable and cold here in this cellar.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I pull forward, I look her very deeply in the eye, and I say, you should know who your friends are here. Do you know that we're friends? And I'm going to become friends. I'm casting Friends.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS and LAURA: What?\nTRAVIS: Is good Percy casting Friends or shadow monster casting Friends?\nSAM: We'll never know until he and Ripley kill us all.\nTALIESIN: I'm getting creepy. Just for flavor. There is definitely some creepy happening.","response":"DM: Okay. You stare at her at this point, intent pushing yourself toward the bars, and she's still looking you over like she's searching for some sort of an inclination as to why you're so interested in these particular questions."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You've been truthful with us so far, correct? You haven't been fudging around or playing games with us, really, have you?","response":"DM: “I've no reason to lie. Worst comes to worst, you kill me where I stand or leave me here to rot. What do I have to gain by lying at this point? Besides, you've already proven you can see through quite a few ruses. Apparently.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So you'd be happy to help us find Cassandra de Rolo, wouldn't you?","response":"DM: “If it gets me out of here and gets me free to do my own business, then yes. I'll have to get a few things from my room, but I would be more than happy to be free of this desolate landscape. This whole town is a ruin of misery, and it has no color. It has no culture. I've grown bored of it.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You say you're a scientist.","response":"DM: “Yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do you use magic?","response":"DM: “I've no interest in paltry magics. I'm more of one who embraces the sciences as a means of understanding mystery. My whole purpose here was one giant chemical experiment.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Then who cast Seeming on you?","response":"DM: “Oh, that isn't to say I have don't have my tricks.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Anna. You will take us to Cassandra de Rolo. You will tell us what you know about what's in the basement. You will tell us where to find Lord and Lady Briarwood, and you will tell us where to find professor Anders. And for this, we may let you go.","response":"DM: “Hmm, may. That word, 'may.'”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll let you leave the castle.","response":"DM: “And if I agree to these terms, you'll release me at this moment? Keep me safe until it is time for me to take my leave?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We may chain you to a bear, but yes.\nLAURA: This is Clarota all fucking over again.\nTALIESIN: You are, at the moment, the luckiest person in Whitestone. Do you know why? Because you're at the bottom of my list.\nTALIESIN: And I take off the hat.\nLAURA and MARISHA: Oh shit!","response":"DM: “Well, then. This certainly explains a lot. I have many questions. I found your recent work very fascinating.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I will be happy to give you an up close and very personal demonstration. Unless, of course, you would rather have conversations about other topics.","response":"DM: “We'll start with the other topics.” She adjusts her coat, regains her composure, and steps up to the bars expectantly."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Vax?\nLAURA: Oh god, are we really letting her out?\nSAM: Get a chain ready, or a noose of some sort.\nTRAVIS: No, we have manacles.\nLAURA: She's got one hand. How's that going to be useful?\nMARISHA: One hand and then one on the bear, right?\nTALIESIN: It means there's only one to shoot off to make sure she won't be a problem.\nLIAM: I pull out a pick and I walk up to the gate and I say, he's a very good shot. She's a very good shot.\nLAURA: He poops on things.\nLIAM: This guy, I've watched turn things into the Jelly of the Month, so I would tread very carefully.\nMARISHA: And then I peek out of the shadows and go, hi. (giggles)","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a check lock pick. This will be more difficult than normal because–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I snapped off a thing in there. Sorry about that.\nLAURA: You're going to use Luck now?!\nSAM: Shall I inspire you?\nTALIESIN: Don't use Luck yet\nLIAM: It's not that bad. That's a 20.","response":"DM: That's a 20 baseline?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, because of my–\nLIAM: Skadoosh.","response":"DM: That was the next one. So you take a moment you walk up all slick and (click)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wait. One sec. This never happens.","response":"DM: You have to get down and you spend the next 30 seconds actually managing to get the pin that she has stuck in there out without actually breaking the spring inside."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sorry about that.\nSAM: Fucking doors!\nLIAM: Shut up!\nLAURA: It never ends!","response":"DM: About a minute and a half of awkward quiet as the sound of scraping metal and jimmying thieves' tools, eventually (click)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're still very tough.","response":"DM: And with that, (ting) the lock comes loose and the bars (creak) open a little bit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket, watch her.","response":"DM: (grunts) The bear, which at this point has been barely visible, steps out of the shadows, as well–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Bear-ly?\n(groaning)","response":"DM: It would be you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Kill him!","response":"DM: Steps out and presents a very puffed-up Trinket made to look intimidating. (growl) Towards Dr. Anna Ripley."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Here's the deal, Anna. You do what we ask, you do not betray us, you do not make our life difficult in any way, and you have my word that you will leave Whitestone unmolested by us. If I sense the slightest hint, if I have a moment where I think that you might make a run for it, if I have a moment where I think you may cough inappropriately, I would ask you to think about everything you did to me, and I would like you to know that I have learned so much more than what you taught me that day, and I cannot wait to show you. And I will. But not until I find you again.\nSAM: Should we shackle her?\nTALIESIN: No.\nTALIESIN: It'll arouse suspicion.","response":"DM: “I'd like to gather my things.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Things? They let you have things in a prison cell?","response":"DM: “Well, I don't have them here in the cell. They're in my room.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We have to go to your room?","response":"DM: “I would like to.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Tell us what you need and we'll get it for you, dear.","response":"DM: “Very well. Come.” And she begins to step up the stairway that leads out of the dungeon."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can you walk quietly? Please?","response":"DM: You can hear the slight chuckle in the darkness. She goes, “I haven't lived this long without learning to step a little gingerly.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh boy.\nLIAM: Let's go parading through the castle.\nTALIESIN: I'll follow her.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's all follow her, right?\nTRAVIS: We should check any of the other cells?\nLAURA: We did. We already checked them all","response":"DM: As you're walking up the stairs, she's talking to you a bit out loud and she's just saying, “This whole entire endeavor– while it did pay well at the get-go and did pique some of my curiosity, I'm very happy to see it out of my life after this.” You guys get to the top of the stairs and there is a closed wooden door there. She comes to the door and listens to it for a second. (creak) Opens it up and looks out. “Huh. Empty.” Holds the door open and says, “Who would like to enter?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You would like to enter.\nLAURA: Do we see anything in the room?\nTALIESIN: Perception is passive as hell right now. I am keeping very sharp eye on–","response":"DM: No, I understand. Looking around. She's taking her steps slowly, and she's looking around corners as you guys progress. The doors that are there– everyone's being very quiet, just the very gentle sounds of careful footsteps against the smooth stone floor. (footsteps) She turns around, looking at the rest of you a little confused, and goes, “Huh. Usually there are a lot more individuals frequenting this castle.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Maybe they've been drawn out by the thing that we incited outside that's been going on for like 45 minutes now?\nMARISHA: Feels like a trap.\nLAURA: No, but there is fighting. Can we hear fighting?","response":"DM: You're inside the castle right now. You could go and if you want to try and enter one of the rooms to the right or left, you can see if there's a window."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are there any open doors?","response":"DM: All the doors are currently closed."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I just want to see if I sense anything around.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 23.","response":"DM: Perception?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Perception, yeah.","response":"DM: Okay. You take a moment and listen around. Silent. Still. It's unnerving."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Does she have a window in her room?","response":"DM: You asking?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We're at her doorway, aren't we?","response":"DM: No, you've just stepped up to the base floor of the castle. You're on the base floor, on the side of it. You're not even quite sure which way is north."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Nobody we're looking for is going to be above us, right? They're going to be below the castle.\nSAM: For sure.\nTRAVIS: So we don't want her to get her shit in her room. We need to be asking how to get below the castle.\nTALIESIN: We'll get there.\nSAM: What are you getting?\nMARISHA: She wants her weapons.\nTALIESIN: And I want to see what she's built, anyway.\nSAM: Why would we let her have a weapon?\nTRAVIS: We're not going to.\nLAURA: Can't we look at what she's built after we fight them?\nSAM: It could be useful.\nTALIESIN: As we're walking, I just want to very gently take my gun–\nSAM: And shoot her with it.\nTALIESIN: And just put it gently at her back, going, nothing personal. I'm just feeling a bit nervous.","response":"DM: “Understood.” She straightens up a little more and continues walking ever so carefully. Not quite leaning her head or making too many large movements, but definitely still keeping a seemingly nervous eye on how quiet the atmosphere is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I creep over to one of the doors in the room and see if I can hear anything on the other side.","response":"DM: You don't hear anything inside the room. Roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (groans) 14.","response":"DM: You hear some slight, muffled, dull thud noise, but you can't really tell how close it is. It's very, very faint."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I see if the door handle is–","response":"DM: (click) It's open."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I step to the side and push it open.\nLAURA: And?","response":"DM: Do you go up to the window and look?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sure.\nLIAM: I'm following my sister in, doing the buddy cop thing.","response":"DM: Okay. You two coast up to the glass and look out, and another cloud-covered, slightly drizzly morning has taken the caldera between the mountains that houses Whitestone in this forest. You can see the entire city of Whitestone down below this elevated part of topography. What you do see, one, are large plumes of smoke, about six or seven of them, all gathered towards what you can tell now is the north side of the city, which is the closest to you. You guys are on the southwest side of the castle, based on the spatial awareness you've now made."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Where the more upper-class folk would live, I'm assuming?","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll perception check, while you're glancing out."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Sure.\nLIAM: So close.\nLAURA: That could've been so bad. 20.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It was like whee– oh.\nLAURA: Nice. I would loot, but it's Percival's home. Do we see anything that looks like it could be a doorway leading down, or anything?\nSAM: We've gone up, right?\nLAURA: We're on the main level.\nTALIESIN: We're going to try to get my sister first.\nLAURA: Do you know, Percival, how to go under?\nTALIESIN: Yes. Unless there's something new, then yes. I was born here.\nLIAM: Before my sister leaves, I grab her by the arm and say, “Listen to me–”\n(creaking)\nLIAM: What is that? Pizza. Forget I said that. \"Listen to me, I do not have a good feeling about this.\" And I start to undo the cloak that's on me, \"And I want you to wear this.\" And I tie an elven cloak. \"Shut up, please. I don't need it. You will wear this. You will stay hidden when it is needed. You almost lost me. I almost lost you. You will wear this as needed.\"\nLAURA: I will wear it. Thank you.\nLIAM: I walk out ahead of her.","response":"DM: Pull the hood up. So you get advantage on stealth checks. As you guys step into the hallway and move forward, Pike's physical form is drifting along you guys as she takes each step. You can see she's stopped a little bit and she's lost in thought for a moment. And she looks at the rest of you and says, “There is a great evil here. It's–” And you can see part of her form flicker and shake and almost blink for a moment, and then she reaches forward and says, “Something's willing me away. I ca–” And with that, her form just vanishes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!\nTALIESIN: Damn.","response":"DM: As you feel this warmth on your hand, Vax, and the symbol of Sarenrae that you have embedded in your glove. You look down, and it has a slight glow to it, similar to the color that her divine energy form had taken. And you see it just slowly fade, but not entirely. The symbol seems to just have this general very faint radiation. A reminder, or at least what small semblance of a connection to her in this dark, dark place."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (whispering) Goodbye, Pike.\nTRAVIS: Before we move on from that foyer, can we see the front door from where we're at?","response":"DM: If you go another 20, 30 feet ahead to the end of this hallway, it should open up into the main entrance chamber and you would be able to see the doors."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So we're not there yet, okay.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to take a moment and I have an epiphany, and I'm going to shift my form into a castle guard.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Vex, what you saw through the window, should we move through the castle quickly because it's unguarded?\nLAURA: I guess. There's fighting going on now. I don't want to eat right now.\nTALIESIN: We'll get it on the break.\nLAURA: I saw fighting, lots of fighting. I feel like if we're going to move, we need to do it quickly.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we're on a clock.\nSAM: Okay, let's go.\nTALIESIN: Anna. I lower the gun and let her move forward.\nTRAVIS: You don't need to lower it.","response":"DM: She continues forward, heads towards the rest of the hallway into the main entrance chamber of the castle, very carefully looking about. She gestures to the rest of you to follow. And as you follow along beside her, you can see the two large front doors that situate the entrance, the main entrance to Whitestone–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are they open?","response":"DM: No, they are closed."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I have 20 caltrops. Can I throw ten of them in front of the door?","response":"DM: Yeah, if you'd like to."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I watched him do that, and I shrug and I reach into my pack, and I throw 30 more of them.","response":"DM: Okay. The area has a little more coverage on there, but nevertheless there is a nice cluster of nasty spiked caltrops now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That was a good idea. Very smart there.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Thank you.\nSAM: Grog, using your noggin.\nTRAVIS: One a day.\nTALIESIN: Was that a thought for the day, then? Don't sprain yourself. We need you later.\nTRAVIS: I'm back.","response":"DM: Ripley starts making her way up the stairs, and the staircase ascends for a good 15 feet up before it splits into two curved stairways that come around to a second landing to the second floor."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So hang on one second, real quick, he's dressed as a guard?\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nMARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast Enhance Ability on you. For charisma.\nTALIESIN: I don't need it.","response":"DM: Well, you do now."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Has it worn off?","response":"DM: It lasts for a minute, so yeah, it's worn off."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, it only lasts for a minute?","response":"DM: Friends only lasts for a minute."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I had enhance charisma on for a while, but now it's gone, so if you do it, what I had is gone–\nTRAVIS: Pour some sugar on, Keyleth.\nMARISHA: I'll do it. I'm going to enhance. In case we get busted. So you'll have advantage on persuasion rolls.","response":"DM: Okay, so you have advantage on all charisma-based ability checks."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Also, no one forget that we have Heroes' Feast.\nLAURA: Wait, if I put the holy oil on things, it lasts for a few hours, right? It lasts for half a day or something?","response":"DM: I'd say it lasts for about an hour after application."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Wait until we're in the thick of it.","response":"DM: The oil will eventually just drift off, as it is an oil."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It dries and stuff.","response":"DM: Yeah, it dries and gets rubbed off. It lasts about an hour after application."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's head to her room.","response":"DM: Okay. You head up the stairs. She's being very quiet about it. She comes up to the landing, heads to the first major hallway that opens up into a long set that goes all the way to the eastern side of the castle. You recognize this area. This is where a number of smaller guest rooms were arranged. There's also a reading room. Around the corner and down the way is where your father's study is. And around the back is where Professor Anders's study was. She continues forward and eventually stops at a door halfway down the hall. Motions to all of you. “Do you mind?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What do you want? What's in there?","response":"DM: “My belongings.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I want to see what you've been working on.\nMARISHA: I'll wait outside and stand watch.\nLAURA: I walk in with her.\nTRAVIS: I stay right next to her.","response":"DM: So in her room, it's very plainly decorated. You know these rooms are generally very well decorated, just in case. Decorations have been taken off. This room looks very minimalistic and for the most part more for function than anything else. You see there is plain sheets on the bed, most of the room's open space is taken by a long table that's been put here that has a series of alchemical glassware, and you can see what looks to be small containers that contain different materials and powders and seems like she does her own work here. There are two open drums on the side, and there is this very caustic smell to the air. There is an acerbic tinge to the nose as soon as the room enters. There's just this ever-present, very heavy fresh rust smell to the room. She walks to the far end. Underneath the desk that contains this alchemical setup, she pulls a small chest out–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I watch very carefully.","response":"DM: She brings the chest to the top. She opens it up, and on the inside you can see just some folded clothing. She moves the clothing off to the side and she pulls out what looks like relatively simple leather armor. “May I?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Very, very slowly.\nLAURA: Don't be creepy, Grog.\nTRAVIS: Creepy? I'm going to put her through the wall if she moves in the wrong way.\nTALIESIN: You know, I almost killed you in Stillben.","response":"DM: “Really?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do you remember?","response":"DM: “Huh. I didn't know that was you.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I was kind of curious if you had figured it out or not.","response":"DM: “No.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Tell you what, I'll hold onto that armor for the time being.","response":"DM: She's partway into it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, you can take it off. We'll put it in the Bag of Holding. You can put it on after we're done.","response":"DM: (heavy sigh) She folds the tunic portion over the chest piece and hands it to you, pulls out some of the arm braces and leg guards and hands those over as well."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Show me your work.","response":"DM: She goes underneath the chest and she pulls out two small glass vials and sets them on the side. She then reaches underneath and pulls up what looks to be a false bottom of the chest. Places it. At which point she reaches in and pulls out a metallic construction that you all see looks not unlike in shape and purpose as the Pepperbox that you've seen Percy use all this time, though it has only a single barrel and has a small rotating four-part chamber to it. It's a little more refined than his construction, and you can see now part of the alchemical setup she has in here actually is, and you recognize this as you get close, part of it is designed in the creation of ammunition and refining the powder that is used by this process. You see a series of notes that are off to the side that have sketches outlined of your Pepperbox, though not really accurate. Almost like they were recalled from various individuals that had seen it in person and given accounts of it. She's been keeping a very close log of eyewitness accounts of your weaponry, apparently, for some time."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She's a fangirl.\nMARISHA: Yeah, she is.\nTALIESIN: I'm disappointed. I was expecting something more imaginative.\nTALIESIN: (scoffs) Hack.","response":"DM: She reaches down and–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Keep your hands away and step back.\nTALIESIN: We'll give those to you when it's time to leave.","response":"DM: “How am I to defend myself should things go, and pardon my term, ass-up?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are you planning on fighting with us? Helping us?","response":"DM: “You say you won't release me until you've finished what you're doing here. I assume that what you're doing here is ending the current reign of those who rule this town. I can't assume that's going to end with a conversation.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I lean my head in and say, the goliath could turn your head into paste now, if you like.\nLAURA: Tell you what, we'll take the weapons and give it to you if we need your help.\nTALIESIN: Let her have the armor. As a sign of good faith.\nTRAVIS: What if it's enchanted armor?\nTALIESIN: And give me your ammunition. And when it's time, I will hand some to you.\nSAM: So you're leaving her the weapons but no ammo?\nLAURA: No, I'm taking the weapon.\nTALIESIN: The weapon's useless.\nLAURA: I don't care.","response":"DM: She gives you the weapon begrudgingly. Hands you a pouch about this big that's pretty heavy, containing a series of iron balls inside. You can see there's the various instruments she uses for forging them and crafting them there across the table. She puts her hand out towards you for the armor. She puts it on, a little quicker this time, because she feels like she had a little victory. She takes a little vial, puts it in her pocket. She reaches over and grabs a little pouch inside the side with change. Puts a little bit of money to the side there."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What are in those vials?","response":"DM: She reaches in, pulls them out, shows them to you. And you recognize the color. She goes, “What, you think you're the only one who doesn't occasionally suffer a wound? I have to look after myself, as well.” It's a greater healing potion."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: One of them is? Or they both are?","response":"DM: The one she pulled out and showed you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What about the other one?","response":"DM: “Really?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Really. Lest your brains leak out your ears.","response":"DM: She pulls out the other one. “This is in case things go really poorly and I need to uphold my sense of self-preservation.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What does that mean?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, what does that mean?","response":"DM: (sighs angrily)"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Convince us to let you keep it.","response":"DM: “It allows me to make a fleeting escape on the air as opposed to by foot.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh. Well, then give it to me.\nTRAVIS: Axe.","response":"DM: And with that, the glass almost shatters with the amount of frustrating force she slams it into your hand."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Careful. That's made of glass, darling.\nTRAVIS: I was only stretching. No need to get testy.","response":"DM: So you have a Potion of Flying in your inventory right now."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And god forbid you'll see how gracious we're feeling when we find Cassandra De Rolo unhurt.\nSAM: Yeah, Grog! Grog with the steal.\nLAURA: Ooh, I get a piece of paper!\nTRAVIS: Shit, Potion of Flying.\nLAURA: This is awesome.","response":"DM: “Yes. Everything else here is of no interest to me.” She kicks one of the drums on the way out. Slips back into the hallway."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Anything you could use, Percival?\nTALIESIN: Was there any more black powder? I've taken all of her ammunition and black powder, I suppose. Anything else that looks useful to me?","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's intelligence.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh. Well, hell. Eight.","response":"DM: Eight? You give a quick once-over of the room. The place is pretty barren. Other than the large drums of what seems like three inches of some weird caustic substance at the bottom."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I hate what you've done with the place.","response":"DM: In what way?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I figure I may poke you later to get a better understanding, just so we don't have to bore other people with her technical accoutrements, but I would like, at some point, an out-of-character understanding of what I'm looking at. Of what I could discern about what I'm looking at.\nTALIESIN: I want to kill something tonight.\nLAURA: Yeah! We were also running out of time.\nTALIESIN: Exactly.\nLAURA: There are people fighting right now.\nTALIESIN: Committed as much to memory as possible. Let's go.\nLAURA: When we defeat the Briarwoods, you can come back and explore this room to your heart's content.\nTALIESIN: Touche.\nMARISHA: It'd still be your place.","response":"DM: “Now, to your sister, is it?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Up or down?","response":"DM: “This would be on the other side of this floor.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Which room?","response":"DM: “I think you know the room.” And you know that you're not too far from your sister's room."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: They let her keep her room.\nLIAM: See you later. I go stealth. 20. No, 23.","response":"DM: As you guys make your way across the other side of the hallway, back toward the western side of the castle, eventually finding where, not far from where your room was, as well as the rooms of your brother and Cassandra. They're all localized in this one area of the castle, so you were all nearby. She goes straight to Cassandra's room. Goes to the door and doesn't touch it yet."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A quick question before I open this door. Am I going to have a violent reaction towards you when I open it?","response":"DM: “I certainly hope not.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Good. (sighs)\nTRAVIS: I stand right behind her.\nTALIESIN: I motion to everyone, stay back, open the door, and I push Dr. Ripley into the room, with me behind her.","response":"DM: Okay. As you pull the door open, (creak) you push her in. The room is dark. There is no light.  hat little bit of light that peeks in from the hallways in the poorly-lit interior of the castle for this time of day. You can see there is her canopy bed. You can see there is her cabinet in the corner, but the room appears to be dark and empty."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Torch.\nMARISHA: Are there any wall sconces around? Torch wall sconces on the outside?","response":"DM: There are a few along the walls that are currently burnt out at this point."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I take a torch out of the Bag of Holding and I take the Firebrand War Hammer, ignite it, and hand the torch to Percy.","response":"DM: Okay. You glance about the room. It's lived in. The actual bed covers themselves are pulled off. You can see she has a vanity mirror cabinet in the far corner. It's all put away. The chair's open a little, like it was stepped out of. The room is absent of anyone."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I walk over to the closet. I open it.","response":"DM: Okay. You open the closet. She has outfits there. Many of them don't appear to have been worn in a while."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Looking for signs of life with the paper on the desk.","response":"DM: You search her desk?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's have a real roll. That will do.\nMARISHA: That's a really good roll.\nTALIESIN: That's a natural 20.\nTRAVIS: It is?\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nSAM: Classic Percy.\nTALIESIN: It was doing this on Group Hug, man.\nTALIESIN: She's not here.","response":"DM: You see Ripley's also like, “Well, if she's not here, she's somewhere else in the castle. I assume.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Where would she be?","response":"DM: “I don't spend my time wondering or curious about her well-being! I just know that she is usually here.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Anna. I'm going to take a leap of faith and believe, contrary to all evidence, that you are a smart woman. I pull out the gun, and I put it to her head. Now. If you were the Briarwoods, where would you put my sister?\nLAURA: An important question here, Percy. Are they keeping her, or is she here of her own volition?\nTALIESIN: I don't know. And if you don't know, make me believe it.","response":"DM: “I know she's not allowed anywhere near the ziggurat or near our distillery.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Distillery? I pull the gun away.\nMARISHA: Ahead of schedule? I'm sorry. Hi. By the way, I'm Keyleth. We haven't really talked yet. What schedule were you trying to keep? What was the deadline?","response":"DM: “We were trying to create enough continuous acid to develop enough residuum to be used in the reconstruction of the ziggurat. Once I had developed enough of the compound to where we no longer had to create more, my purpose was complete. I had no interest beyond that. The rest is gibberish to me.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So you're telling me that somewhere in this castle there is a storage facility full of caustic acid that dissolves the very stones of this castle?","response":"DM: “Yes.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I reach out and I take out my potion of acid resistance and I drink it.","response":"DM: Okay. Mark that. She looks at you, goes, “Yes. If you've seen the vents of greenish fume billowing out in the garden, that is where the distillery exhausts to.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well, this is interesting.\nLAURA: Ziggurat? What's it for?\nMARISHA: What exactly does it do?\nSAM: Hurry up. Time is of the essence.","response":"DM: “I don't know. It has something to do with the Briarwoods' interest in some third party. Someone they've been working with. Someone I've not met, someone who I have no interest in inquiring within.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: A name. Give us a name, girl.","response":"DM: “I was not given a name. They don't speak of this individual's name. They are very secretive about it. They paid well, they gave me land, they gave me a title, and when things were done, I was to go free. Which is why I was not happy in which the predicament you found me, made me.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Where can we find this ziggurat?","response":"DM: Her eyes trail down to the floor. “The ziggurat itself is, well, based on the tunneling structure, the distillery's direction? Right beneath the city of Whitestone.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The city or this castle?\nMARISHA: They're going to destroy this fucking city.\nLAURA: Is it underneath the Sun Tree?","response":"DM: “No, not the distillery. The ziggurat might be.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, what?\nTALIESIN: Oh dear.\nMARISHA: They're going to– yeah.\nTALIESIN: Are they still melting down the whitestone for magical energy?","response":"DM: “No, I don't believe so, not for weeks. We finished that process for quite a bit now.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So you're done melting the whitestone, but you still have a whole bunch of this acidic compound kicking it in a warehouse somewhere?","response":"DM: “Well, not in a warehouse. That's all kept stored underneath the garden of the castle.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We need to finish clearing this house now. I don't know if they're even here.\nTALIESIN: We'd better move.\nSAM: Downstairs.\nTALIESIN: Downstairs.","response":"DM: “You were asking about Anders, though. Do you wish to pay him a visit?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (growls)","response":"DM: You can see a smile on her face. She does not like Anders."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: She's trying– Percy? Percy, she's trying to bait you. She's trying to waste time right now. Come on.","response":"DM: “He was your sister's keeper.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: She's trying to– Percy, la la la. Percy, come on.\nLAURA: He's probably with the Briarwoods.\nMARISHA: Come on, he's not there.\nLIAM: I'm off sitting in the shadows, but I say, Percival, we need to cut off the head.\nTALIESIN: Is it possible that my sister would be with him?","response":"DM: “It's very possible if she's not here.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Anna, shut. Up.","response":"DM: “Very well.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Percival.","response":"DM: “I only say because my whole–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: “Anna!” And I notch an arrow and aim it right at her throat. “Shut. Up.”\nMARISHA: Percy?\nSAM: Where would this professor be?","response":"DM: “I imagine his study. It's around the corner.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We'll check his study, and then we'll go.\nMARISHA: No!\nTALIESIN: Just his study, then we'll go.\nMARISHA: Percy!\nTALIESIN: Even if he's there, if she's not there, we'll leave.\nTRAVIS: Go. Lead the way.\nMARISHA: We're running out of time.\nLAURA: Brother, run and check the study.\nLIAM: I start running towards the direction that was described.\nLAURA: Let's go towards the under–\nTALIESIN: Very well.\nLAURA: Lead the way down.","response":"DM: “Very well.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No talking.\nSAM: Wait, we're going down?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we're not leaving Vax.\nLAURA: We're heading down. He's going to catch up.","response":"DM: She begins making her way towards the landing that leads to the stairway down, whereas you stealth off in that direction. You find your way around that corner. Go ahead and roll perception."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: As I'm moving, by the way, it's minor, but I take out Clarota's (sniffs, groans) metallic cap and put it on, and I also whip out this other cloak that I've been looking at and whip it around. You're not here. And now continue on.\nLAURA: Well, you've worn Clarota's thing before.\nLIAM: There's two things. Moving forward.\nLIAM: That is 22.\nLIAM: Do I need to stealth again, or am I already stealthed?","response":"DM: You rolled stealth before this."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah. It was like 23 before.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I'm going to move toward that sound. Carefully.","response":"DM: Okay. It leads down. There are three doorways on this side of the hallway. The central door there is where you hear the noise coming from."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, I'm sticking my ear to the door, and I'm going to listen for a full minute to see what I hear.","response":"DM: You hear a little bit of quiet and a light sobbing. Then you hear another voice, a male voice, an older voice, just say quickly, “Shh! You be quiet until you're told to speak. They should be close.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I want to gently try the door handle.","response":"DM: Okay. It is not locked. It does turn."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I want to push it like one inch in and try to peek in.\nSAM: Just the tip.\nLAURA: Don't.\nMARISHA: I'm having deja vu.\nLAURA: I know. We've been here before.","response":"DM: You glance inside the room, and it's a nice study, and there is a fireplace on one side that is part of a continuation of a two-story fireplace column that goes up through the castle on this side. There are shelves of books, there is a desk in the far corner, there's a couple of chairs laying around. From this side, from what you can see, in the center to the back of the room is an older gentleman wearing a breastplate. You can see his very short gray hair, a little bit of facial hair that's grown in but not to a full beard. It looks like it's been left to go on its own for a little while. And he's currently holding a young woman, roughly early twenties or so with dark brown hair with a couple streaks of white through the sides of the temple. Holding her by her hair with a dagger to her throat, saying, “Shh! Now. When I tell you, you'll say what I told you to say. Got it?” And you can see she has tears streaking down her face she's like (gasping)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I back up about five steps and very quietly say, Jenga.\nLIAM: And I run at the door and I kick it open and throw at him.\nSAM: Yeah!\nTALIESIN: Well, that happened.\nSAM: Yeah.\nLAURA: So we take off running towards him.\nMARISHA: Here we go. Jenga. Fucking asshole.\nTALIESIN: Dick!\nMARISHA: It's a trap. It's such a trap.\nSAM: Of course.\nLIAM: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Come on, Sneak Attack.","response":"DM: Both those individuals right there. Go ahead and make your attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What am I looking at?","response":"DM: Okay, so as you burst in. You can see the man's holding, there's the desk behind him, right there. Papers and stuff scattered on there. There's some tables around with some chairs. There are these large bookshelves that hold this side and there's the fireplace in the far corner right there. Flames. Warming the room. There's a small chandelier on the ceiling that has magical light emanating from it that gives the room this warm glow. You don't care right now because you're\nthrowing a fucking dagger."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right. But he's behind her a bit, right?","response":"DM: Yeah, he's holding her right there with a dagger to her throat."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, I recently added the sharpshooter feat, so three-quarter and half cover means nothing to me. So I'm going to aim for his eye that's peeking out the side. All three are going right in his eye.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So here's the first. The first is 24.","response":"DM: That'll hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, the second is 26. As you can tell, I've been screaming monster sounds. My voice is a little ragged. 26 on the second.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And 16 on the third.","response":"DM: 16 misses. But the first two strike true."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The first, it's three plus seven is ten. Plus 14, 20, 26, 29, 33, 39. That's the first one. And then the second one does four plus six is ten. Oh! But it's surprise, so the first one is doubled because it's automatically a crit.\nLIAM: Well, it was 39, so now it's 60, 78. For the first one. Ten for the second.\nTALIESIN: I love you.","response":"DM: Okay. So 88 points of damage. You just went 80 miles per hour on your first turn. As you kick the doors open. (whoosh) The first dagger, he sees it coming towards him for a second and attempts to dodge out of the way, and as he moves this eye out of the way, the dagger (impact noise) right into this one, he screams out (screaming) in pain as it just plunges into his eye socket. Not deep enough to actually hit any brain, but enough to definitely take that eye out as any sort of viable method. The second one just hits him in the shoulder and a reaction to that, Cassandra screams out, “No, run! It's a trap!” At which point, he takes his dagger and just runs it across her throat."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (softly) I don't think it's her. It's not her.","response":"DM: You see crimson start to pour down the front as she (choking). Go ahead and roll initiative."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Why would she be saying it's a trap if it's not her?\nLAURA: Could be a peasant.\nLIAM: I am running at him and stabbing the shit out of him.","response":"DM: Okay, as you cross this boundary, I need you to go ahead and immediately make a constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll use luck again. Yeah.\nSAM: That's two lucks.\nLIAM: That's 17 for constitution saving throw.\nLIAM: Am I able to use evasion for that?","response":"DM: You can, technically."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So if I succeed, I take no damage.\nLIAM: I'm going into his guts.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So first attack is a 25, second attack is a 20, and the third attack is a 26. One, two, three?","response":"DM: One, two, three."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, and I'm going to turn the poison on for the poison dagger, which I'm going to use for the second.\nLAURA: Just flip the little switch.\nLIAM: Well, it just drips. So nine for the first, eight for the second, plus the poison is– shit, I didn't copy it down here. I think it's 1d12. Let's say it's 1d12, because I can't remember. If anyone wants to correct me, they can. Five points of poison added to the five is 13. And then the last dagger is nine.","response":"DM: Okay. So as you rush up to him and shank him repeatedly in the side, the breastplates deflecting part of the blow, but you're managing to find openings in the side, and you go for a shoulder and jam it underneath his arm, through his ribcage, and he screams out (yelps) in pain, and you can see there's blood pouring out the side of his mouth. And the dagger's returned by now, but there's this giant gaping, bleeding wound on the side of his face where one of his eyes is completely ruined. He looks both surprised, angered, and very, very confused about the way things suddenly happened."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Hello.\nLIAM: That's it, I'm out.","response":"DM: Okay, he's going to go."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Goddamn it.\nLIAM: We're six seconds in, Taliesin.","response":"DM: First off, there were two sets of decorative armor on the sides of the wall that suddenly have filled with some sort of reddish arcane energy that gives them a solid physical form, and they both step off their pedestals and begin (heavy impact) making their way towards you. But before all that happens, Professor Anders in front of you, wounded and not looking terribly happy at the moment, is going to use his action to attempt to cast Confusion on you. So he goes to step back, and (grunting) just releases his hand in front of you as one functioning eye bores into you as he screams out. You can feel the pressure towards your head. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wisdom, which I have advantage.","response":"DM: Well, wisdom saving throw because of that anyway, so."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is a 20.","response":"DM: A 20? The effect shrugs off. Nothing on you. He is going to attempt to step back–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, attack him.","response":"DM: So you get attack of opportunity on him."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, it's a 22.","response":"DM: 22? Okay, that does hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Eight.","response":"DM: Okay. He will use his bonus action and he– let me look up the definition of it real fast. Okay, takes a bonus action as he steps back, “(grunts) Come. Take this inspiration to defeat my foe!” And he lends an inspiration dice to one of the armored creatures stepping forward towards you. Now it's their turn. Both these armored creatures pull out swords, and they lift up the shields that they had to their sides, and they rush into you from two sides right there. You see this as they rush up to you: they're not really touching the ground, they're gliding across it. So the first one is going to attempt to strike you with two attacks of its longsword. That is a 14?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No.","response":"DM: Second one is a 17."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No.\nLIAM: Yeah, but I'll use uncanny dodge.","response":"DM: To reduce the damage by half?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, so the first strike hits you for 13 points of slashing damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So, half that or all of that?","response":"DM: That'll be half that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Half that. Okay, so seven.","response":"DM: There you go. And then that's going to be a 24 to hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That hits, yeah.","response":"DM: And this is not halved. Okay, that's 12 points of slashing damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is that including sprint?","response":"DM: Well, the dash action, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's full dash?","response":"DM: This is your movement and then dash action, you guys, because you guys were down in this area, heading down the stairs. You just made it up and over. And this is Ripley. We'll use that for Ripley for now. Everyone else roll initiative. We're in a new combat round."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What the hell!?\nMARISHA: Oh! Percy's pissed.\nTALIESIN: I Percy'd again.\nMARISHA: He Percy'd.","response":"DM: Who got him that dice?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The golden snitch is powerful.\nTALIESIN: No, I was on Group Hug last week with somebody else's dice, and it was comedy.\nLAURA: It's just you, Taliesin.\nTALIESIN: Thank you.","response":"DM: You are the anti-Wheaton."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm the anti-Wheaton.","response":"DM: If you guys were to play in the same group, all RPGs would fold into themselves and no longer exist. It's like the end of Timecop. It'll be terrible. Okay, so initiatives. We have 25 to 20?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 28.","response":"DM: 28."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 21.","response":"DM: 21. Remember your advantage, by the way."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's the second roll.\nTRAVIS: Feral instinct.\nLIAM: I don't remember. It was early 20s.","response":"DM: Early 20s, yeah, so it'd be Percy, Vax. 20 to 15?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 13.\nSAM: 19.","response":"DM: 19."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh wait, sorry. Might have jumped the gun a bit there. I'm excited. Sorry. I'm bringing up the ranks anyway, I think. It's fine.\nLAURA: 11.","response":"DM: 11."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm Vax.","response":"DM: I know, I said Vex! I got it right this time!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, you're from California.\nTALIESIN: Can I drag Ripley with me?","response":"DM: You can, but you'll be moving half movement."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Fuck.\nTRAVIS: Leave her. Somebody else–\nTALIESIN: So as my bonus action before anything happens I'm going to tell her, she lives, you show us where the entrance to the caverns are, you walk with your things. And run.\nLAURA: She was trying to set us up in this trap. You do understand that?\nMARISHA: Oh yeah, she's all about this fucking shit.","response":"DM: Full movement?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Full movement.\nLIAM: I have one healing potion left, and I'm going to take it and stick it into this girl's mouth and empty it and maybe drip a little on her neck as well.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Maybe hold her neck. Make sure it goes down.","response":"DM: Well, you have to roll to heal. You pull back, and it's a really unsettling thing as you pull up her head to try and feed her the potion."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's 2d4?","response":"DM: It's just a regular healing potion?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, regular. It's the lowest of the rung. Moderate? I think it's called moderate?","response":"DM: Sorry, got it right here. That's 2d4 plus two."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So four. Six. And then I want to step in front of her, between her and that one, and then stab the one.","response":"DM: Okay, as you take the potion, it's a messy process. You get most of it in her, but some of it drips on the ground, but the wound seems to close. All the blood goes away on the ground around her neck from the splashing of the potion, which has vanished entirely, and you can see she's (gasping)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's good.","response":"DM: She's right on the edge, but she's looking pretty rough."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So is that the bonus action, or is that the action?","response":"DM: That was your action."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Action, okay. By the way, I'm realizing I didn't click my boots, so I did one two three before, and the third one missed, so luckily that worked out, but I'm not clicking those.","response":"DM: Thank you for the reminder. So used to dagger, dagger, dagger. I'm like, “Wait, no.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I just step between them, and that's all I can do, yeah?","response":"DM: Okay, so you move into there, great. That's your turn."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, I mean between her and the closest one to her.\nTALIESIN: Oh yeah, we've got this new thing now. That's so much better.\nLAURA: What's going on.","response":"DM: So you move."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I was hoping to stand in front of her, yeah. Like that.\nTRAVIS: Dead sprint after Percy.","response":"DM: Okay, and your speed is?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 50.\nLIAM and TALIESIN: (heavy footsteps)\nTALIESIN: Yeah!\nMARISHA: What's up, Grog?","response":"DM: You can get all the way up into here, but that's all you can do this turn. Yeah, so you're (heavy footsteps) bounding down the hall. You push past Percy and rush into the room, and you see a young girl on the ground, doubled over, barely conscious. You see Vax stepping in front of these weird, glowing armored creatures, and at the back of the room, there's a man with bleeding, gaping eye socket."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What the fuck did you do?\nLIAM: Welcome to the party.\nSAM: I'm up? I run as fast as my little legs will take me. 25.","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can't see them, so I'll just inspire– Who's going to get in there next? Who's behind me? Can I inspire people that I can't see?","response":"DM: I think they have to be in your sight."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You can see me, though whether or not you want to inspire me at this point is definitely debatable.","response":"DM: You can inspire somebody else in the hallway, if you'd like."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, but we'll keep it.\nSAM: Sure. I will inspire Vex, behind me, and I'll say, (sings) Arrows and bows, they fire at our foes and kill them, and they make them ghosts. They won't let go.\nSAM and LAURA: (sing) Arrows and bows!","response":"DM: As the beat hits you, you feel yourself a little more sure shot with any arrows. Take your d10 inspiration die."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Forearms go (explosion noises).\nMARISHA: Professor Anders.\nSAM: Professor Anders.\nMARISHA: Professor Anders.\nLIAM: Mr. Anderson.","response":"DM: He sees this giant creature in the room looming and he reaches up and closes up one eye and goes, “You. Do this for me.” And as he looks at you for a second, he releases another spell and you feel a familiar arcane grasp begin to curl over the back of your mind. Go ahead and roll a wisdom saving throw with advantage because of your Heroes' Feast."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on, baby. One more time.\nTRAVIS: 14.","response":"DM: 14. Your brain, not tempered against these types of magics and having previously failed you before. You feel your will no longer become your own as now you are an instrument of destruction controlled by Professor Anders. You've been Dominated."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Damn it!\nLAURA: Fuck!\nSAM: Oh no. Dominate goliath.\nLAURA: We've got to kill that motherfucker!","response":"DM: Okay. I mean, he looks to you and goes, “Kill that one!” And points to Vax, and you look down at Vax with a grin as the blood-letting you've wanted so bad, your target lies before you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hulk versus Wolverine!","response":"DM: Ending Anders's turn–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Remember what he did to your beard.\nTRAVIS: I know, is it me grinning, or is it dominated Grog?","response":"DM: Moves to here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Hulk versus Wolverine, man. I'm excited by that.","response":"DM: Both of these horrors move and shift around now at this moment to get on each sides of you, giving them both a flanking bonus. Now it's four strikes, longsword against you, with advantage. Double eights. Can't roll shit!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Why advantage? I'm just curious. Give it to me, but what's the advantage from?","response":"DM: They have advantage against you because they moved into flanking position."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Because they're in flanking. Got it.","response":"DM: Which, for those who're curious about it, it is an optional rule in the DMG. It exists. Second attack. Three and a four. I can't roll!"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (sucking sounds)","response":"DM: So this guy just whiffs with both of his weapon strikes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You're sucking his energy?\nTALIESIN: (raspy) I have your power.","response":"DM: Natural 20 on the next strike."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and MARISHA: Spoke too soon.","response":"DM: Two natural 20s."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Damn it!","response":"DM: It was a miss and a natural 20 on the first attack, and then a natural 20 on the first roll of the second attack."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Goddamn it. I'm sorry.\nMARISHA: Spoke too soon.","response":"DM: So you take on the first hit–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You mock fate, fate punches you in the mouth.","response":"DM: That would be 16 points of slashing damage, and 20 points of slashing damage with the second strike, so a total of 36 points of slashing damage. And you can feel this strange, angry vibrating growl coming from within this unhallowed armor that floats before you. That ends their go. Keyleth, you're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm running like hell. Running, running, running. Can I see? Can I peek around the corner just to see?","response":"DM: You can just peek around the corner and see the circumstance."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I see Cassandra?","response":"DM: You do, yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Healing Word.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do you know it's her?\nTALIESIN: Yeah.\nLAURA: Either way. Whoever it is.\nSAM: Do you know what she looks like?\nTRAVIS: Just do what you're going to do.\nLAURA: Just do it.\nSAM: Okay.\nMARISHA: Healing Word.\nTALIESIN: Family resemblance.\nMARISHA: Family resemblance.","response":"DM: I'd say given the circumstances, you have an inkling that someone's in danger there. And the calling of Jenga. So go for it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'll cast it– no, I'm just going to keep it at 1st level for now. I'm going to save my higher-level ones for Cure Wounds, so I'm going to cast it at 1st level, so that's 1d4 plus my spellcaster. Three. That's not too bad. No, sorry. 16? No, 13.\nLAURA: So I'm with Anna. Trinket– I tell him to hold onto her and drag her along with us.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So he clamps down on her arm.","response":"DM: So one, two. He's going to attempt to grapple her. Go ahead and roll an athletics check with advantage because she's not expecting it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 16?","response":"DM: Okay. Trinket grabs onto the scruff of her coat and begins pushing forward. They both get the rest of half of his movement because he's forcing her forward. That's as far as he can get."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But I can keep running? I can run all the way up?","response":"DM: What's your speed? Is it 30?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 30.","response":"DM: You get about there, right at the edge."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So I can shoot an arrow?","response":"DM: No, that's your movement and then your dash action to get there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, cool.\nTALIESIN: With no weapons and no armor.","response":"DM: Leather armor, basically."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Leather armor, yeah.","response":"DM: Percy, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to run in. I can move six, right?","response":"DM: You can move six squares, yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: One, two. Can I get a good view of Professor Anders and maybe get a little cover from the dining room table?","response":"DM: You can a little bit, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Does it seem more extreme than it has been in the past?","response":"DM: It seemed pretty extreme in the past. It just started; you don't know. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Bonus, I pull off my hat of disguise, drop it on the floor. And I'm going to just unload at that motherfucker.","response":"DM: As you pull off the hat, your image shifts fully to Percy, at which point Anders looks back and sees this source of smoke and glances over. His hand falls away at a moment of realization, eye goes wide. “Percy…”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Shot one.\nTALIESIN: Oh, for the love of god!\nMARISHA: Oh, when it counts.\nSAM and MARISHA: (ricochet noise)","response":"DM: In the frustration, the rage and such, you pull up your gun and as you go to fire, the bullet gets caught in the chamber and it almost ejects the entire barrel from the front of it. It's not too difficult to repair, but it definitely upsets the current flow."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to attempt to repair it really quickly. Trying to remember how to do that because I hate it. (mumbling)","response":"DM: Is it an action or is it an attack to do? Should say under the–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Action, shit.","response":"DM: Yeah, so you have to use your next turn to try and repair it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (sighs) So I'm just going to sit and scream a little bit. (shouting)","response":"DM: Okay, you can see that this whole moment here, as the smoke pours out from the front of the gun, you yell out angrily and there is this unnatural bassy reverb from your scream that shakes the room. Anders actually takes a step back from this and is looking about the room, and finds himself basically trapped in the far corner of his study."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, you better not!","response":"DM: That ends your turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's my turn.","response":"DM: Vax."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to use disengage, and I'm going to hop over Cassandra towards Anders and stab him in the other eye.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: First attack is 21.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Second attack is 17.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, ten on the first, ten on the second.","response":"DM: Okay. Needs to make concentration checks to see if he can maintain his Dominate. Against ten damage? That succeeds, and yeah, that succeeds. So he maintains concentration of his spell, but both daggers, you just run up and stab him. This angry grunt under your breath with each stab and you can feel the armor itself is now warm with the pooling blood from the wounds that you gave him before. He's looking pretty rough."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So, question? I asked if I could hit the eye. Did I hit the eye?","response":"DM: Unfortunately, no. It's one of those things where a Sneak Attack would be an eye shot for this one. You go and try and stab towards the eye, and he pulls away; he knows what's coming and uses that inertia to jam it into his side and stab a second time in there. So yeah, no purchase in the eye, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. And I'm squared off right in front of him.","response":"DM: Yeah, just right in front of him. That ends your turn. Grog."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So when you're dominated, does that mean charmed?","response":"DM: Essentially, you have to follow his orders. He's not directly, specifically controlling you right now, but he told you, “Attack him,” so you have to use all the things at your disposal to now attack him."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay. I can't try and break the domination? Or rage?","response":"DM: Nope. You get a saving throw at the end of your turn."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm not raging.","response":"DM: You're not raging."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So I only get two.","response":"DM: One. You step over Cassandra, (impact noise) stepping on the back of her leg, and find your way right there, which is flanking him between Anders, so you have advantage on both your attacks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shit.\nTRAVIS: It's a three.\nLAURA: That's good.\nTRAVIS: 21.\nLIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Second attack."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 26.","response":"DM: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Really trying not to enjoy this.\nTRAVIS: 18 for the first one.","response":"DM: 18 points of slashing damage. No, sorry, bludgeoning damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Bludgeoning, yeah. And fire. 20, 21.","response":"DM: 21 points of bludgeoning and fire damage with the second strike."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I am on my feet, but I am swaying back and forth.","response":"DM: Unexpectedly, these two titanic slams hit you from behind. The first one throws you into Anders for a second. Anders then pushes you away, and as you are still reeling from the impact, you look up and see the hammer come down, and (whack) you move your head out in time, preventing you from being squished, but the impact hits your shoulder and the side of your neck, and your whole body crumples into itself. You cry out in pain instinctively, just (screams) from the hit. And your whole world blurs for a second as you're barely keeping yourself on your feet. Grog, that ends your turn. You can make another saving throw with advantage to try and shrug the effect."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah. Add wisdom right?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 19?\nSAM: I continue my long journey into the room.","response":"DM: You just get past there, and you can see into the room. You have visual on, yeah, pretty much everything in the room from there."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So I have to make a ranged shot if I'm to do anything.","response":"DM: Correct, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What do I see? Can I see how rough Vax is?","response":"DM: At a glance, it's hard to tell."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm bleeding out my mouth.","response":"DM: He's also facing away from you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Looks normal to me.","response":"DM: You see Grog and Vax facing off the guy in the corner. You see two of these large armored entities."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, I'll go for them.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wand of Magic Missiles. And I'll shoot three at the one at the left. That's the first charge, and then use three additional charges on the one on the right.","response":"DM: Okay. How many charges were restored in the wand from your last long rest?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I roll every day, and I restored five and I had used five, so it's back to normal. I have seven total.","response":"DM: So you're casting three on one and then–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: An additional three on the other.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it. So that's 3d4 plus three to each one. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Right, 3d4. Okay.","response":"DM: (magical sound effects) Releasing the wand on both flicks of your wrist, you can see these bursts of arcane energy swirl around and slam into each one of these creatures."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 3d4 plus three? Is that right? Is that how it works, Matt?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, so five (mumbles), eight. Lame. And (mumbles) nine, no wait. Yes, nine.\nSAM: Oh, and I will inspire Grog. (sings) This is the dawning of the age of a-Grog-ius. Age of a-Grog-ius. A-Grog-ius!\nTRAVIS: d10?\nTRAVIS: Not quite my jam, but I'll still take it.\nMARISHA: I knew it. I knew he was going to do that.\nLIAM: Do I get an attack? A reaction attack?","response":"DM: Not unless you have– there's a feat that lets you do that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No.","response":"DM: Yeah, I think it's mage slayer."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I don't have that.\nSAM: Do I see him?","response":"DM: Yeah, you see him."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I take out my broken shawm and I (piercing whistle). And I cast Counterspell on him.","response":"DM: Right, because you took that when you leveled up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, I have to tell a level, don't I?","response":"DM: Yeah, you can tell me what level."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I know, because he's a bard, what he's doing?","response":"DM: You are very familiar with the spell. It is a 4th-level spell."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Then I cast it at fourth level.","response":"DM: Okay. Then there is no roll. With that, he takes a moment to finish casting. You see there's a moment where this bit of purple arcane energy, familiar to most of you as Scanlan's escapes, begins to sparkle behind him and as he goes to step into it, the shawm shrieks out into the room, he (groans) reaches up and covers his eye as it almost seems to be shrill to his head and cause the pain to pulse and the doorway just slams behind him. (panting)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Uh-uh, that door is locked, motherfucker!\nSAM: Get used to it, because I am!","response":"DM: Yeah, that's his turn. That was his action. He's going to use his bonus action to say, “Come to my aid! Quickly!” He's going to put another inspiration die to the other armor. And that's going to end his turn. It's now their turn. They are both going to come around. This one is just going to move around Grog; no attack of opportunity because it's still in your melee. This one is going to step into range from over here. This one is going to turn and go for Percy. Sees this billowing as you're stuck there trying to fix the gun, and just rushing towards you with its shield forward, its horrible, jagged longsword in the air arcing towards you. Two strikes versus you. That'll be a 19?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That hits.","response":"DM: Okay, first strike, you take nine points of slashing damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm down.","response":"DM: So you go down. Second strike, because it's still going for you, hits automatically. It's an auto critical. You fail two death saving throws."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's it?","response":"DM: That ends its turn. This one is now going for you, Percy. First strike. That would be a nine."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No.","response":"DM: It's going to use its inspiration die. Add nine to that, so 18."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 18? That's my armor class.\nTALIESIN: So 19 points of slashing damage, total?\nMARISHA: Okay, can I see Vax down? Which one is he on the ground?","response":"DM: Vax is right there. You see him get slashed from behind, fall to the ground, and you see it raise a blade again and jam it into his torso, pull it out, and there's a streak of blood that just spatters across the ceiling from the force of the arc."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, I think you saw that.\nMARISHA: Okay. So I'm going to move around, tuck in the door a bit.","response":"DM: Okay, so you move in and you see this. As you rush into the room, you see this arc happening."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I tuck right here? God, I'm shaking. Yeah, right behind that door.","response":"DM: Right there, yeah. That'll be pretty much your movement to get there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to duck down, crouch on the floor. I'm going to cast– first I'm going to– god I'm so nervous– I'm going to use Healing Word on Vax, and heal that motherfucker.","response":"DM: At what level?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You're like down down, right?\nLAURA: He's unconscious.\nLIAM: And I– there wasn't even any rolls for that, right?\nLAURA: No.","response":"DM: If you're unconscious and a creature hits you, you automatically fail a death saving throw and if it's a critical hit, which if you're unconscious a hit is an automatic critical, it's technically two death saving throws."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, and just to understand the whole breakdown, but where do the three rolls come in?\nLAURA: If nobody hits you–\nLIAM: Oh, if nobody hits, got it.","response":"DM: Yeah, if nobody hits you and it's your turn, you roll to see if you– but if something keeps hitting you while you're down? Can kill you pretty quick."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Got it.","response":"DM: Like two hits."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But he just hit zero hit points, so whatever I bring will bring him over, correct?","response":"DM: Yeah, and your death saves go away. It's per turn. Per time you go down."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I'm just going to do a– I'm sorry, a level one Healing Word for right now.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes, which gives you 12 hit points. And then I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Grasping Vine, and I'm going to take the vine and I'm going to wrap it around–","response":"DM: Your source?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Huh?","response":"DM: Which source?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Next to me.","response":"DM: Okay. So right here?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I guess, yes.","response":"DM: Okay so, out of the wood, a vine– or it's not wood, actually. This would be a stone wall. So out of a crack in the wall, little bit of material begins to form into a giant vine that forms next to you. What are you doing with it?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I want to wrap it around Cassandra's feet, her ankle, and I want to pull her toward me.","response":"DM: You pull her over to the side and she gets pulled across the ground, and she's on her back now looking up. Her eyes are a little starry-eyed, but she's (panting). Looks very confused, and her eyes are still adjusting to the whole circumstance."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I say, “Hi! Just hang on.” And that's my turn.\nLAURA: Okay. So I saw him go down.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does it look like he's awake now to me? I'm mean, it was all happening very quickly.","response":"DM: You have no idea. This all happens very quickly. You just saw your brother take a huge–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I scream and I run towards him.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I slide down on my knees and slide across the room and try to cast Healing Word the minute– or cast Cure Wounds the minute I get to him.","response":"DM: You won't get close enough to do it, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: If I slide down and slide?","response":"DM: Make an acrobatics check. For this circumstance, due to the circumstances with your brother being on the ground, I'll let this be a little more intense."}
{"prompt":"SAM: With inspiration.\nLAURA: With inspiration. That is– wait, hold on.\nLIAM: Acrobatics.\nLAURA: Acrobatics?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that's good. 17?\nLAURA: Okay, so I'm going to cast that at 3rd level. So that's 3d8. Where are my d8s? That was the worst roll! Nine!","response":"DM: So you heal nine hit points."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's good.\nLAURA: That's okay, because I slid to you.\nLIAM: It was amazing. I'll never forget it.\nLAURA: Yeah, and Trinket keeps dragging her.\nLAURA: Right, okay. It's going to count even though it slipped out of my hand. It's eight.","response":"DM: Eight? Okay. Trinket, holding onto the scruff of Ripley's neck. Ripley then tugs away from the grip. Reaches into the pouch she had earlier. As a bonus action throws down a small rock that (explosion noise) fills this entire tunnel here with a 20 by 20 fog cloud, apparently. And now that she's disengaged, she's going to…"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: She smoke-bombed out.\nLAURA: She ain't got no weapons.","response":"DM: Nope. Trinket does get an attack of opportunity on her as she runs past."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah, Trinket does. Come on, Trinket.","response":"DM: No, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No? Not so much?","response":"DM: No, sorry."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nine.\nLAURA: Oh wait! Oh, no. I've got to roll for attack first, huh?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That was not what I was doing. So that's 21.","response":"DM: That hits, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, good. That's way better.","response":"DM: She has no armor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I don't know what I'm doing. What is going on? I never attack with Trinket. 13.","response":"DM: Okay, got it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Cautionary tale in there somewhere.","response":"DM: She runs past. The whole area is obscured for Trinket. Trinket for the moment really has no idea really where she went as she rushed past, and bit out and is now giving out this (bear growl) notification growl sound, but in the chaos right now, it's not catching your attention as your brother nearly died before you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Right.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to break– first off, I'm going to fix my gun.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and make your roll."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to make my roll. Come on. What do I have to roll? (muttering) I hit the difficulty. Does that–","response":"DM: You hit it, then yeah. With the creature looming there, you manage to bend it back into place. You get it aligned as best as you can. That's your action, though."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: If that had been a slightly bigger fuck-up, that would have been– oh god! Okay.","response":"DM: So your gun's functional, but that's your action."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to use an action surge anyway, so it doesn't matter.","response":"DM: Yes, you are. Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to break off from this guy, and I'm going to rush towards Professor.","response":"DM: Okay, gets an attack of opportunity on you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Go ahead. Don't care.","response":"DM: Guy rolls a 14."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: So you just (whoosh) duck under it instinctually. It comes toward you. Eyes forward, you duck underneath the blade."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I push him in the face. I don't care.","response":"DM: Okay, you get right up to there, and you can see Anders backing away as you approach."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to unload in him.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 21 to hit.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 25 to hit.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's a natural 20.\nMARISHA: There is Percy!\nTRAVIS: What the fuck?","response":"DM: Anti-Wheaton."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, let's see, that's 11.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 14.\nTALIESIN: Yep, this is the critical which is seven, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 with fire damage.","response":"DM: Okay. How do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How close to him do I get? And this was without smoke damage, I might add.","response":"DM: You can get one more step up there. You can take the shots as you're stepping towards him, unloading."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm unloading as I walk towards him.","response":"DM: So the first one (gunshot) blasts out the shoulder. You can see the bone exposed, the metal breastplate sundered by the bullet, as he backs up (gasping) As you're walking towards him, he begins shouting, “Percival, you disappoint us all. All you had to do was die like a good de Rolo.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Traitor! And I've got two more shots. Next shot.","response":"DM: This one (gunshot) into his chest, and you can see the actual breastplate bends inward to the wound and he's (choking noise) spitting out blood from his mouth as he bends forward. “This land has a greater destiny. You and that fool Ripley, you place your faith in toys and dust. You seek the transient truths.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How close am I to him at this point?","response":"DM: You're stepping up to him."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Perfect.","response":"DM: And as you're doing this, as you're pull the mask down, he says, “I die to rise again. We are his blood.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I put my gun in his mouth to shut him the fuck up. “You're the face I saw when murder entered my heart. This is your doing.” And I pull the trigger.","response":"DM: With that, a resounding blast (explosion noise) echoes through the room. The back of his head just scatters across the wall behind him. The top of his head folds in a little bit from the lack of a substantial base, and he tumbles backwards, releasing the gun with a limp (splat) onto the ground behind. You're still holding the Pepperbox in front of you, hands shaking. As you hold it there, looking at it, you can see there's a flash of purple energy across the barrel that has Anders's name across it and (fluttering noise) the name burns away, leaving the barrel blank."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (heavy breathing)","response":"DM: Smoke begins to subside a little bit. It's still there, but it seems like at the moment, it has this release aspect to it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's my turn.","response":"DM: Yeah, that is your turn. Vax you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How close are the suits of armor to me? I can't tell.","response":"DM: There's one over here, and there's one– technically it's right next to you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right next to me? And am I still prone?","response":"DM: You're still prone."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So how much movement does it take to–","response":"DM: Half your movement."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Half my movement.\nSAM: Don't give him an attack of opportunity.\nLIAM: No, I'm going to get up, and I'm going to use disengage.","response":"DM: As a bonus action, okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, and I'm going to skip back into the corner, and at this point I can throw one dagger at that suit of armor, so I'm going to do that.","response":"DM: Yes, you can."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is 19.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I have no voice left. That is an 11.\nTRAVIS: Am I flanked by two suits of armor or just one?","response":"DM: Nope, there's just one right next to you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'll turn to him and rage.","response":"DM: Okay. Regular rage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Regular rage, and swing away.\nLIAM: Classic rage, we call it.\nTRAVIS: Classic rage.\nLAURA: Good old classic rage.\nTRAVIS: 14?","response":"DM: 14 hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Nice. And 25.","response":"DM: Both hit, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You get three hits.\nTRAVIS: Nah, just two.\nLAURA: I thought rage– oh.\nTRAVIS: Believe me, I know. 17 with the fire damage. First one.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 18 on the second one.\nTRAVIS: Nope.\nSAM: Did you hit?","response":"DM: Scanlan. You're up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, twice.\nSAM: Okay. Oh, me? Oh man, I can't do anything against these fuckers.\nMARISHA: Yes, you can.\nLIAM: You're Scanlan Shorthalt.\nMARISHA: Believe!\nMARISHA: Just the tip.","response":"DM: Okay. You'll get into melee with him if you do."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What does that mean?","response":"DM: Means if you want to do any ranged attack or spell attack roll, you would have disadvantage on it, but otherwise it has no effect."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He can attack you, though, because he's right next to you.\nSAM: He won't be for long.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So I get up close in, like five feet away, and then I'll just Thunderwave him.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I do that thing where frat boys do the chest bump.\nMARISHA: Like, “Come at me, bro?”\nSAM: Yeah. (grunts)\nMARISHA: That's awesome.\nTRAVIS: (quietly) We did do that.\nSAM: That's just like 2d8.","response":"DM: Yeah, okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Roll two d8s.","response":"DM: Is this the 1st-level Thunderwave?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I believe it is, yes.","response":"DM: Okay, so makes a constitution saving throw. No, he rolled a natural four, so it takes 2d8 thunder damage and he is pushed over the table, and then would fall over if it wasn't now drifting above the ground a few inches. Rights itself, but it did push it away from you. Roll 2d8 damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I did. It's only nine points of damage.\nTRAVIS: Misses.","response":"DM: Sorry. 25. Rolled an 18 naturally."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hits.","response":"DM: And that is a 21."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Both hit.","response":"DM: Okay, so you take six points of slashing damage, halved to three, and nine points slashing damage, halved to five. So eight points of slashing damage total. Two strikes against you, Scanlan. That is an 18."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, yes. That hits.","response":"DM: Okay, and then a 12."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hey, that misses!","response":"DM: So you take– that's seven plus 11 points of slashing damage. (whoosh) As it goes to strike a second time, you see the second blow coming and just duck out of the way. That ends their go. Next up is Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So there are two guys alive right now?","response":"DM: Correct, yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: One's on Scanlan.","response":"DM: One's on Grog. The one on Grog is looking a little rough. The one near Scanlan's doing okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How's Cassandra looking next to me?","response":"DM: She's fine. There's no blood. There's nothing; the wound is gone entirely. But other than that, she looks fine."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Looks fine. Okay, I've got my Grasping Vine still up. I'm going to wrap it around the guy that's close to Scanlan and just yank him off of Scanlan.","response":"DM: Okay. This pulls him over Scanlan's form and slams him right next to Cassandra."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, and then I will just go, oh! And pop him with my staff.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You can hit things?\nMARISHA: Yeah, I got a big old staff, yo! I'm not great at it, but I can do it. Oh, that's not bad. 16.","response":"DM: 16 does not hit, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Aw. (ping)\nSAM: He's got armor.\nMARISHA: It sounded nice, though.\nSAM: It did.\nMARISHA: Kind of resonated a little.\nMARISHA: Yep.\nLAURA: So I'm still down on my knees.","response":"DM: You're still down on your knees. Your brother got up and rushed off, he seems okay, (panting) taking a breath for himself."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I look up at Percy who is covered in smoke, and I grab his hand and I say, “Percival, how are you?”","response":"DM: His head slowly turns towards you, the mask still on. You can see his eyes just barely through the glistening circular glass slots where he looks through. The smoke still billowing up from underneath, the head slowly turns towards you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Fine.\nLAURA: “Darling, take the mask off,” and I–\nTALIESIN: I don't have a turn yet.","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And I shoot at the guy that's attacking Grog.","response":"DM: Okay. He is technically in melee with you, so you get disadvantage on these strikes unless you want to move away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, so you move back a step. That is a 21."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hits.","response":"DM: Okay, you take nine points of slashing damage as you reach back. The creature (whoosh) arcs with its sword and manages to strike you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Bastard!","response":"DM: Roll for your attacks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, that is a 26 and a 23.","response":"DM: Both hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I didn't Hunter's Mark him, because I'm brilliant. Yes! 15, 30, 34 points.","response":"DM: 34 points of damage for both?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, two eights. Plus 14. Plus my bracers.","response":"DM: Right. You pull the arrows out and launch them both simultaneously, two arrows in one notch; release them both. One slams into the armor. That one goes underneath the helmet, and as it strikes you hear this horrible echoing (screeching) screech that echoes as the armor (thud) falls to the ground."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah!","response":"DM: You can take the rest of your movement, if you like."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I stand up.","response":"DM: Well, you were standing up to move back."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah I wanted to be like–","response":"DM: Okay, so you pulled back while on the ground. Release the arrows."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, like up into them.\nLAURA: And Trinket isn't allowed to move any at all?","response":"DM: Trinket can, if you want."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can he run after her?","response":"DM: Yep. Rushes out. Will get there. Rushes through the fog and looks over and sees her right there. Okay. That ends your turn, and now it's her turn. She goes into a full dash and takes off."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Does Trinket get an attack of opportunity for that?","response":"DM: Trinket does get attack of opportunity."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nMARISHA: Come on, Trinket.\nTRAVIS: Scratch her up.\nLAURA: That's in the corner. I can't really say.\nTRAVIS: Oh, you piece of shit\nLIAM: (clicks his teeth together)\nLAURA: Don't do that. I hate that sound.","response":"DM: So what did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's a 12.\nLIAM: Good to know.","response":"DM: 12?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: 12 does not hit, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, it doesn't.","response":"DM: Even with no armor, she's a pretty quick one. She ducks below and bolts down the hallway and around the corner."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Why did we let her have anything?\nLAURA: You're out.","response":"DM: So that ends your turn, her turn. Percy, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to pull off the mask and walk forward a bit, about there, and take three shots at the armor.","response":"DM: Okay, regular shots?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shots.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: With one ice, so 14.","response":"DM: 14 misses. Deflects it with the shield."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Make sure I'm doing this right. Yeah. Goddamn it. 17.","response":"DM: Deflects the second one with the shield."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Damn it!","response":"DM: Heavy armor on this one."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Dropping sharpshooter for the third one.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Not that it helped. 16.","response":"DM: This one actually manages to duck out of the way and splinters across the wall behind it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: They're tough.\nTALIESIN: That's my turn.\nMARISHA: Kill them.\nLIAM: I'm just going to walk as far as I can, so 30 feet.","response":"DM: There."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Am I within 40 feet?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Then I just stand.","response":"DM: Well, you can use the rest of your action to keep moving, if you'd like."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would like to move to the suit of armor please.","response":"DM: Run towards it, jumping and putting one foot on the table; using that as momentum to rush in the air. Go ahead and roll your attack."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 24?","response":"DM: 24 hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And 25.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 20 with fire damage.","response":"DM: Nice."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And 16 with fire damage.","response":"DM: Gotcha. (grunts) Bringing the hammer down, the helmet actually gets pushed into the armor and has to reform itself. Before it has a chance to, you bring around the hammer and hit the shield with such force that it pushes it into itself and slams it against the wall. You take the back of the hammer and slam it up under the actual helmet, hitting the creature. You see the flames burn across the side of its arcane form, causing it to shimmer for a second. It's looking pretty rough. Instead of using the table, though, you use Grog's knee. You just run, jump onto his knee with one foot, leap off, blade in the air, go for the strike."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's cool!\nSAM: What do I add?\nMARISHA: Your attack bonus.","response":"DM: Attack bonus for your weapon."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't know what that is!\nTRAVIS: It is never used.\nSAM: Okay. It's a plus seven!","response":"DM: Yeah, so?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 15.\nSAM: That fails.","response":"DM: 21."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That is successful.","response":"DM: That is seven points of slashing damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.\nMARISHA: Ugh. You guys, I thought someone was going to kill him!\nSAM: I tried, but he hurt my wrist really bad!\nMARISHA: I know, because I don't want to fucking burn any spells on this asshole.\nTALIESIN: Just hit him with your stick.\nMARISHA: Just– ugh. God.","response":"DM: Roll for it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Goddamn it, this hopefully works– nope.\nTALIESIN: No! Wow!\nMARISHA: Nope, that didn't work. (tink)\nLAURA: Oh gosh. I guess I shoot him. Can I see him to shoot him?\nLAURA: And I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.","response":"DM: Hunter's Mark him?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And then I'm going to shoot him.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh gosh, I'm just so nervous about picking the 20. No. 19?","response":"DM: 19? The arrow hits the armor and shatters across the side."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shit.\nTRAVIS: 19?\nLAURA: 24.","response":"DM: 24 does hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nTALIESIN: Yay, you hurt it.\nLAURA: Well, maybe.\nTRAVIS: That's a high AC. Because of the shield, right?","response":"DM: Because of the shield and the armor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 18.","response":"DM: 18 points of damage? With that, the second arrow strikes into the center of its chest armor. It hits some sort of core where its arcane form is held and the reddish energy blinks out, and the armor just (impact noise) crumples to the ground."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's two of them!\nLAURA: What's up, bitches?\nTRAVIS: That was tough.\nMARISHA: Okay, I immediately turn my attention to Cassandra. Can I do a medical check on her to make sure she's okay?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a medicine check, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Where's Ripley?\nSAM: I start running out the hall to Ripley.\nTRAVIS: Me, as well.\nLAURA: Oh, Trinket is still running after her, too.","response":"DM: Yeah, it's his wisdom bonus."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm rolling a big dice for Trinket! Oh, that's good. 26!","response":"DM: 26, okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 25.","response":"DM: 25, okay. Trinket is giving chase best it can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Except wait. Hold on, I get advantage because he's got advantage on smell perception. Oh, it's the same thing.","response":"DM: Okay, so Trinket is keeping track, but is having a hard time fully keeping up at this point unless you're giving full attention towards him at this point in time, but is keeping a track. He is rushing as fast as he can down the stairs and is currently out of your sphere of personal influence at the moment."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I should have Hunter's Marked her. (sighs)\nTRAVIS: I grab Scanlan, and we're taking off after her out the door.\nMARISHA: I rolled a 17 on a medicine check.","response":"DM: Okay, checking Cassandra, there is no sign of a wound now. She seems to be not in any danger."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: So, she's on the ground, dazed."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to collapse in a corner for a minute and start using my ascot to clean some of the gore off my weapon and my clothing and my mask.","response":"DM: It is a lot of gore. Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Are we out of combat now?","response":"DM: You guys are currently out of combat."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. I'm going to, clutching my bleeding belly, walk over toward Keyleth and say, that was a close one.\nMARISHA: Yeah. You know, I feel like we've been here before– oh, right. We have been here before.\nLIAM: You know I'm in love with you, right? And I kiss her.\nSAM: Oh!\nTALIESIN: (coughs heavily)\nSAM: Persistent cough.\nLAURA: What the fuck?!\nTALIESIN: I want to see what color you turned. Oh my god, yeah!\nTRAVIS: Dude, what?!\nTRAVIS: Or attempting to kiss.\nLAURA: Roll for contact there?\nSAM: Roll for tongue action.","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No.","response":"DM: So, as he breaks from the momentary, unexpected embrace, you catch yourself off guard."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You know, the way you turn into animals and stuff is really cool.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to collect some of Vex's arrows.\nMARISHA: Are you sure you're–\nLAURA: I leave the room and look for Trinket.\nMARISHA: Just… let me. And I Cure Wounds him. I'll do a 4th level. Shut up, Sam. I just can't find my spell. Yeah, I'll do that 4th-level Cure Wounds.","response":"DM: Burn all the spell slots. Go ahead and roll."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Folks, we don't know what we're doing. None of us know what we're doing.\nMARISHA: I feel like in the moment I would just do it really at a– shut up.\nSAM: Sure, overcompensate.\nMARISHA: Right. What do I roll? Hang on. 1d8. So I'm rolling 4d8. I need d8s, goddamn it! Give me d8s.\nTALIESIN: You can't have my d8s.\nMARISHA: Why can't I have your d8s?\nTALIESIN: Okay, fine, have my d8s.\nMARISHA: That's fine, give me one more.\nMARISHA: Okay, 14, 18. (counting)","response":"DM: What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm collecting three or four of Vex's arrows from the ground and getting them in my hand, and I'm staying back from all of this and letting it happen.","response":"DM: Okay. Collect the arrows, Vex has stepped out of the room to pursue after Trinket, Trinket is currently pursuing Ripley. Grog, you watched that happen."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, Grog and Scanlan ran out of the room after Ripley.","response":"DM: Okay, have you guys bolted out? Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We're yelling out, Ripley!\nSAM: Ripley!\nSAM: We shouldn't yell, Grog.\nTRAVIS: Fuck that. I yell anyway.\nLIAM: Was there a total?\nMARISHA: 33.\nLIAM: Yes, I feel better. Thank you.\nTALIESIN: That's good. I'm going to now take my handful of what is now basically a switch, and I'm going to start whacking him with it really hard on the chest.\nLIAM: Who?\nTALIESIN: You! Don't go into rooms by yourself, god damn it!\nMARISHA: I back into a corner upon seeing this, as Percy ruins the moment.\nLIAM: Percival, he had a knife to your sister's throat. He was going to kill her.\nTALIESIN: Thank you, but count to ten. And now I drop them and go over to my sister.\nLIAM: I was afraid she was going to die.\nMARISHA: To be fair, you did get her throat slit, but it's okay.","response":"DM: As you're saying this, you turn around, you can see she's sat up and she sees this conversation and goes, “Percy?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Hi.","response":"DM: “Percy!”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.","response":"DM: And she gets up off the ground and runs up and just grabs you and embraces you tightly. You can feel all the muscles tense in her body as she just holds you with a slight shake to her body."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm so sorry for leaving you.","response":"DM: “I thought you were dead.” She pulls away for a second and just looks at you, and there's a coldness to her face. She's happy, but even for her young age, you can see there's lines at the corners of her eyes. She's probably been through a lot. She smiles and looks up at you again and you can see there's the white shocks in her hair, and she looks up and touches your hair and goes, “I see we've both survived quite a bit.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I wouldn't trade.","response":"DM: She reaches up and holds her neck. “I'm good. I'm good.” And she steels herself for a second, and even more so, you see there's an intensity to her."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Perception check?","response":"DM: To…?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Insight. I want to make sure she's not holding anything really important back.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Insight? Do I get a bonus for that right now? It's a wisdom– yeah!","response":"DM: No, because you were concentrating."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This is not a saving throw, though.","response":"DM: Yeah, and that's wisdom, not a saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 11.\nTALIESIN: We're putting an end to the Briarwoods tonight. Before the sun sets. This is the end of them. It's all going to be over, and we're going to stop whatever it is they're doing under the city.","response":"DM: “You say this. We've tried twice.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I know. This is it.","response":"DM: “That's what the others thought. You left me, you know.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I know, and I'm so sorry.","response":"DM: “Good. Well, if we're going to do this, let's get ready.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You're going to your room.","response":"DM: “Yes, I am.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: To wait until this is over.","response":"DM: “No. No, I'm not. I'm going to my room to get my things. To get my mother's armor.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (sputters) You're– I don't think that's a very good idea.","response":"DM: “You've been fighting them for what, a few days? I've been fighting them for nearly three years. You have no power over me, brother. And if our goals are aligned to free this city, let's do it together. But I don't have to listen to you.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: God, you're irritating. Fine. Ugh!","response":"DM: She walks out of the room."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Percy!\nTALIESIN: She's so obnoxious. What?\nMARISHA: You have a sister.\nTALIESIN: Oh god, I do.","response":"DM: You guys, charging off. Trinket's keeping trail. She's run down the stairway, he is beginning to slowly gain on her. She reaches the front doors, does remember the caltrops. Jumps over them, grabs the door, opens it, and rushes out into the daylight. Go ahead and roll a perception check for Trinket."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, come on, Trinket.\nLAURA: He saw it happen! He's got really good vision.\nMARISHA: Come on, Trink.\nTALIESIN: Yay!\nLAURA: Oh yeah, that's like 24.","response":"DM: Yeah, Trinket just jumps over. The door's only slightly open so Trinket has to stop and wedge his way through."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can he cannonball into her? To try to catch her?","response":"DM: It's the same speed as if he dashed. It would be the same speed."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I whistle at Trinket to get him to stop.","response":"DM: Okay, as you get to the landing you whistle out, and Trinket is just now pushing through the door and gets out for a bit, looking back and forth. Looks over the shoulder, and runs back to you. It appears that Ripley has scattered into Whitestone somewhere."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Damn it.\nTRAVIS: We stop.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We need to find the Briarwoods.\nTALIESIN: I'm still upstairs. Are you going to come meet us again upstairs?\nSAM: We'll get Trinket and go back upstairs, wherever they are.\nTALIESIN: Taking a short rest.\nMARISHA: We're taking a short rest?\nTALIESIN: We're waiting there. They followed her down; I'm waiting on Cassandra.\nTRAVIS: I could stay down in that foyer.\nTALIESIN: Come up.","response":"DM: Are you waiting in the study?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, waiting in the study.","response":"DM: Okay, she goes off to her room. You're there for a few minutes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Does Grog show up?\nSAM: We come back and say, that Ripley is very talented. She got away. Talented Dr. Ripley.\nTALIESIN: We have bigger issues than Anna at this point. Grog, do you have the Bag of Holding?\nTRAVIS: I do.\nTALIESIN: Can you scoop up what's left of Professor Anders?\nLAURA: Can I loot him first? I mean, just see what's on him.\nTRAVIS: Like, his head bits?\nTALIESIN: I don't want any of him sticking around.\nMARISHA: Do we have to put him in the Bag of Holding, though?\nTRAVIS: Why can't we just set him on fire?\nMARISHA: Yeah, stuff him in a closet or something for now.\nTALIESIN: Fire will do.\nTRAVIS: Is there a fireplace in the room?\nTALIESIN: There is. Throw him in. Fine, we'll throw him in the fire.\nLAURA: Wait. Let me see what's on him, first.","response":"DM: Okay. Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We don't want him coming back.","response":"DM: He's crumpled up against the desk in the corner, there's all these papers that got pushed off the side, there were a bunch of random scrawlings."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 24.","response":"DM: 24? Okay. You search his body. You find 120 gold pieces on him. Not a whole lot. He doesn't keep his important shit on him, for the most part. You do find,  however, the boots that he's wearing are very finely crafted, and unlike the rest of his wear, have a hand-stitching in it that is exemplary in construction and doesn't match with the rest of his ensemble. So it seems like something you'd wear more for function than for actual style. Pardon."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I take them.","response":"DM: You take them."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Take his shoes.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does anybody have magic? Can you see what these are?\nSAM: Sure, I can look at them.\nLAURA: Look at these, Scanlan.\nSAM: I look at them.","response":"DM: Okay, if you're taking a short rest, you can take the short rest to inspect the boots, get the feel for them, they are indeed enchanted. They are a pair of Boots of Levitation. Once per day, you can trigger the levitation for up to ten minutes as per the spell. You can't actually move as part of it, you just levitate in the air, and you have to push off to get space."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So like zero-G.","response":"DM: Zero-G."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Like Willy Wonka.\nMARISHA: Zero-G boots! Oh, hell yeah.\nSAM: Who do they fit?","response":"DM: They fit anyone who wishes to put them on. Magical items alter themselves."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, we're playing with that later.\nTRAVIS: I'll just hang onto it. I'll just hold onto it.\nMARISHA: Can we all just try them once when we get back to Greyskull Keep?","response":"DM: Anything else you want to do while you're waiting?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Anything else in the room? Can I sniff around the room and investigate?","response":"DM: Yeah, go ahead and make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I drag Anders over to the fireplace.\nLIAM: I'll look with Scanlan.\nSAM: 12.\nTRAVIS: He doesn't quite fit, so I have to snap some joints.\nLIAM: 27.","response":"DM: Okay, good. As you're looking through and finding papers, papers and ledgers and tough discussions of old classes, untouched on the side, you go through one of the bottom drawers, and there's a lock to it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, let's unlock that.\nSAM: Vax, do you need my help to unlock it?\nLIAM: No, Shorty. Hold on. Are there any traps in there?","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, that is 20.","response":"DM: It does appear to be trapped."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It does appear to be trapped?\nLIAM: So what do I roll to undo that? Dexterity? Lockpick?","response":"DM: Thieves' tools, as well. So same check you did."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I can open it for you.\nLIAM: That's a natural 20, so that's untrapped.","response":"DM: As part of that, you notice that this mechanism is when it opens, if there isn't a switch underneath it held that's hidden, it will cause a poison dart to launch out in the direction of whoever's in front of it. You hold the button, you find it, you open it up without an issue, and you find the spring mechanism, snap it, and remove the little poison-tipped bolt, and chuck it to the side."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, wait. Give me that. I take it.","response":"DM: Okay. You have a poison-tipped bolt."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: For a tiny little hand-crossbow is essentially what it is."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So now I've got to unlock it, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah. Hey, 20.","response":"DM: Natural 20?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, not a natural 20.","response":"DM: Oh, okay. Easy enough to unlock at this point, you get it open, you pull it open, there's a collection of letters."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Percival, come here. You're probably the best person to know what to make of these.","response":"DM: You glance through and inspect them, and you take the next ten minutes or so to get the gist of these letters while Cassandra's away. Many of them talk about a slew of things that are disconcerting to you as the information hits you, and you relay this information to the group. Notes on the removal of key magical defenses during the political meeting at Emon. The discussion, as in making sure that certain individuals and safeguards that are usually made during political meetings like that were not present during that endeavor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Evidence is what that is!","response":"DM: Notes on best construction methods using the mined whitestone and repairs for the manse in the ziggurat."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA and TRAVIS: The manse?\nSAM: As in a mansion?","response":"DM: A manse is a place or a home; it has many different meanings. They're warning Anders, and there are multiple letters at different periods of time over the past few years that are warning Anders of an arrival of Seeker Asum's spies."}
{"prompt":"SAM: He's a good guy.\nLAURA: Oh!\nSAM: No, he's a bad guy?","response":"DM: There are letters talking about plotting, diverting political attention away from Whitestone to leave it a political enigma during this period of time.  There are letters talking about planting information within Wildemount that would lead their investigation team to believe the Briarwoods had been found dead."}
{"prompt":"SAM: This is a whole paper trail!","response":"DM: And occasionally there are mentions in a lot of these letters that speak of, “The Undying King shall return, we are his blood.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Jarl? What?","response":"DM: The Undying King shall return."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where did she get Jarl from?","response":"DM: We are his blood."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, “we are.”\nMARISHA: The Undying King…\nTALIESIN: Shall return.\nTALIESIN and SAM: We are his blood.\nMARISHA: Which is what he said.\nSAM: And then it says Jarl.\nTALIESIN: Jarl. Maybe he was dictating.","response":"DM: The letters aren't signed."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay? Are they all of the same hand?","response":"DM: They are all of the same handwriting. In the cluster, there is one completely unrelated letter that talks about business ledgers and construction of the bridge. It appears to be a simple discussion on the future plans to construct the bridge."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is that in the same hand?","response":"DM: It is in the same handwriting."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And is it signed?","response":"DM: It is signed a Lord Riskel Daxio."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What! Who? Axio?\nTRAVIS and SAM: Riskel Daxio.","response":"DM: Riskel Daxio."}
{"prompt":"LAURA and MARISHA: We know him!","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Who is he?","response":"DM: He's on the Council of Tal'Dorei."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) Oh, motherfucker! He's a spy.\nMARISHA: He's our fucking spy!","response":"DM: He's technically also the one that helped designate the construction of your keep and plotted the construction stuff–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.\nSAM: He built our keep!\nMARISHA: He's the construction guy, he's like our head builder.\nLIAM: He could be spying on us around the keep.\nTALIESIN: He could have a secret entrance to our Keep that he built and didn't tell us.\nLAURA: Holy moly.\nSAM: As soon as I see that, I go down in a crouch and I shit-scry on our keep to see if it's still there.\nMARISHA: Oh my god, that's right, you did that! And I put an elemental there. It's babysitting.","response":"DM: Yes, you did."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hopefully still there. 30 days.","response":"DM: 30 days. Glancing within the kitchen, there doesn't appear to be much that catches your attention."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You shat in the kitchen?\nSAM: I put a mound of shit in a jar in the kitchen and I told them, don't clean it up.","response":"DM: Like you do."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You know.\nLAURA: Like you do.\nSAM: Thursdays.\nTRAVIS: I've got Anders in the fireplace, and I light the Firebrand War Hammer with the magic word, bacon, and I hit it and set him on fire.","response":"DM: There was already a fire in the fireplace, but you just stoke it a little further, and pretty soon the delicious scent of burning human flesh fills the room."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Bacon?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, bacon. Did you not know that's what the word was?\nSAM: So everything's fine at the keep?","response":"DM: At the time."}
{"prompt":"SAM: At the time, okay.","response":"DM: At least, there's nothing on fire, there's no screams, there's no movement. It just seems like the cold kitchen is untouched."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Guys, my shit saw no movement.\nLAURA: Good to know, Scanlan.\nTALIESIN: You've squeezed all you're going to be able to get out of that.\nTRAVIS: Percy. Can we get into the underground caverns from here?\nTALIESIN: Can I think of a way? I'm assuming I know a way to where this might be.","response":"DM: As you have this conversation, a voice from the doorway rings out. “I can take you.” You look over, and it's Cassandra."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: She's going to take us.\nSAM: Is that your sister?\nTALIESIN: Apparently.","response":"DM: She's currently now dressed in armor you've seen as ornamental before. It was armor that your mother trained in when she was young, but was unused for a long time. It seems to be serviceable; it's been updated and such. She slides a shortsword into a sheath at her side, and her hair is pulled back and tied off, and she looks at the rest of the room. “So are we ready?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Let me see your neck.","response":"DM: She steps up and lifts her chin up towards you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: By the way, this is Grog.\nLIAM: I'm going to insight check as he does that.\nTALIESIN: These are my friends, by the way.\nTRAVIS: Do I see anything on her neck?","response":"DM: No. It seems fine. There's no signs of any puncture wounds. Rolling?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's a 15.","response":"DM: Okay. She seems as determined as the rest of you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Lead the way, sister.","response":"DM: She turns around and she begins walking back down the hallway."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we expect any more traps that you're aware of?","response":"DM: “That I'm aware of, no, but I'm certain that there may be. They know you're coming, it seems. So be wary. Be careful. I'll take you to the undercroft.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Did we just have a short rest here?","response":"DM: You did."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Going to heal up.\nSAM: Hey, Percival. Any chance you can load up one of Ripley's guns for me?\nTALIESIN: I don't know if it will actually– I would have to probably train you in how to use it.\nSAM: Really? I've seen you use it. You just pull your finger on the finger part and the big boom part goes out.\nTALIESIN: It's a little more complicated than that, actually.\nSAM: Well, you have to point it at the thing you want to be boomed.","response":"DM: He could use it, he just wouldn't be able to add his proficiency bonus to the attack rolls."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll load one for you. I'll give him her boomstick.","response":"DM: Okay. You take it. You inspect it as you guys are walking along."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Just making sure it functions, too.\nTALIESIN: Doing okay. Not doing great, but I'm doing okay.","response":"DM: It does act as a pistol for rules-wise, which is on your sheet here, so yes, you would have that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do you want it? Just in case yours misfires?\nTALIESIN: I'll steal it back from him if I need, but it should be fine.\nSAM: I'd like to make an athletics check. Athletics. See if I can spin it around and put it in my pocket.\nLAURA: Wait, where did you get it? I had it in my belt.\nTALIESIN: No, if you have it.\nLAURA: I have it.\nSAM: Okay, give it to me.\nTALIESIN: Give it to him.\nMARISHA: Put your eye out.\nLIAM: Don't roll a one.\nTALIESIN: This is literally how she lost her hand.\nSAM: Wait, what's this? Why does it say plus four?\nMARISHA: Yeah, the violins plinking.\nSAM: Well, it's zero, but it says a big plus four next to it for some reason.","response":"DM: I don't know. Add zero. What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It was 14.","response":"DM: Okay. You manage to get it in there. Thankfully it's not loaded, because you feel the trigger go off. But there wasn't a bullet loaded, so it's like (click)."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, we took out the ammunition.\nSAM: Okay, now give me a bullet.\nTRAVIS: Maybe don't do that.\nTALIESIN: I hand him the ammunition. I load four of them.\nSAM: Yeah!\nLAURA: Giving him a loaded gun?\nSAM: I'm a big boy. Well, I'm a little boy. But I'm a little big boy.\nLIAM: I would like to walk past Scanlan and grab it out of his hand.\nSAM: I will prevent him from doing that!","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You guys are fighting over a loaded gun.","response":"DM: Sleight-of-hand check. Athletics check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You go first.\nSAM: Is this a skill check?","response":"DM: Yeah. Add your athletics to your roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 17!\nLIAM: Shut up. 27.","response":"DM: As you go to be, “No, what are you–” It's already gone. You don't even know where it went, you didn't see him take it, you just all of a sudden see it in his hand as he walks past you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I walk over to Cassandra. I don't give her the gun, I just say, you're Cassandra?","response":"DM: “Yes.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I was at the door. He had a knife to your throat. He wanted you to say something to us. What did he want you to say?","response":"DM: “He wanted me to shout for help. He wanted me to draw you in.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I insight check her to see if she's telling the truth?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You've been living here. How did it come that he had a blade to your throat today? How did it all unravel? Have you been living here?\nLAURA: 24.","response":"DM: 24. She's telling the truth."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. That's good.","response":"DM: “Well, after the arrows felled me– I guess I should start at the beginning.” And she's walking along with you guys as she's leading you down the stairs and down to the bottom floor. She doesn't look to you. She's still looking ahead, very intent."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I take that pistol back from you.\nTALIESIN: (sighs) Can we do one thing before we go down into the cellar? This is the best day of my life, and I can't help but be suspicious.","response":"DM: “I completely understand.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is there any way to check if she's being controlled?\nTRAVIS: I was thinking the same thing.\nTALIESIN: Can we put your helmet on her?","response":"DM: The only thing you really have seen work is the Greater Restoration spell you cast on Seeker Asum when you guys were with the Council of Tal'Dorei. That did seem to remove any sort of charm effects, if that's what you're asking."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We don't have that?\nMARISHA: I didn't learn it. Not for today. I thought Pike's magic would hold up.\nTRAVIS: I can try and jog her memory.","response":"DM: “What can I do to make you trust me?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Punch her in the face?\nTALIESIN: I do trust you. That's the problem.","response":"DM: She smiles a little. “Whatever you need.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I've got nothing. (sighs)","response":"DM: Does anyone have any creative means with which they would want to check?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What would happen if we put your helmet on her?\nMARISHA: If she's already controlled–\nTALIESIN: This would disrupt it, maybe.\nMARISHA: We could try it. It doesn't hurt to put a hat on.\nLAURA: It has to be attuned over a short rest, though.\nMARISHA: It does.\nTALIESIN: Does the hat need to be attuned over a short rest?","response":"DM: In theory."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I want to suggest something to you. We rest here for a half hour, and I give this to you. This came from a very strange creature. It will help you resist any control, if there is any control, and one of us– you could even choose– could strike you and try to take you out of it, and if you are not being controlled, then you are being struck across the face, and I'm sorry for that, but if you are, there's a possibility we'd pull you out. I know that would hurt, but it would go a long way to earn our trust.","response":"DM: “If that's what it takes.” She takes it from your hand and inspects it for a second. “Shoddy craftsmanship.” Places it on her head, and it's a little big at first, then it conforms to her head."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Your choice.","response":"DM: She sits down a couple of steps deeper into the cellar. Curls around a corner; ushers you all over into the shadows."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I see, before we leave, are we near any windows?","response":"DM: From this location? No. All the windows that would be here would face out into the north side of Whitestone, which is forested."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Backyard?","response":"DM: You guys are on the north side of the castle now. The city is south from you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What if the little one struck you?\nSAM: Struck her?\nLAURA: Give it some time.","response":"DM: She gives a wry grin. “Whatever you choose.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I could try to tell if she's evil or not. Would that help?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: I don't know. I don't think she's evil. She could be a puppet.\nMARISHA: Can I try this? This is a long shot. My– actually, our fey ancestry, from being half-elves. We're immune to charm effects. Or we have resistance.\nLIAM: Resistant to it.\nMARISHA: Advantage against saves. Since we have that, can we use our fey ancestry, the three of us, to tap into her and see if we can detect a charm?","response":"DM: Your resistance doesn't make you attuned to it. Unfortunately, it's just a natural ability that's inherent. Her being human, there's not a way to really correlate with that. I mean, you've read over her a few times, doing insight checks."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Wait, it was Greater Restoration?\nMARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: Ah!\nSAM: You have that?\nTALIESIN: I have a potion. This should solve all of our problems.\nSAM: Or you could save that for when one of us becomes a vampire.\nTALIESIN: No, it will be– And I'm pulling out a potion bottle. This is if you are controlled. This could fix it.","response":"DM: She puts her hand out. Her leather glove's pulled over it now. You've never seen her militant before, and it's a really interesting visual to you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I look at her.","response":"DM: She drinks the potion. Whole thing down. (coughs)"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That was actually a minor healing potion. I was just seeing if you did it intentionally.","response":"DM: She gives a wry grin and wipes her mouth. “I thought I recognized that terrible earthy taste.” She tosses the crystal decanter to you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Clever boy.","response":"DM: “Huh. You always were the clever one.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I figured it was worth a shot. Best we're going to do.\nSAM: Am I supposed to punch her in the face now?\nLIAM: No.","response":"DM: “Do you need this thing?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll take it back, yeah.","response":"DM: She hands it back to you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's been a long time. (sighs)","response":"DM: “Simon repaired it for me when he was working here. I haven't seen him in a while. I'm worried.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's go down and take care of this. Cass?","response":"DM: She leads you down through the cellar–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, hang on. Before we enter: it's safe to assume they know we're coming, correct?\nSAM: If they're there.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: Yeah.\nLIAM: Better safe than sorry.\nSAM: Can I ask Cassandra–","response":"DM: You can ask her anything you'd like."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are the Briarwoods going to be down there? Are they here?","response":"DM: She goes, “I have no confirmation of it, but they spend most of their time down here. They're preparing for something.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Have you ever been down here?","response":"DM: “I'm not allowed down here, by their orders, but I've snuck down a few times out of curiosity. I've only gotten so far before I had to return, but I've made it through the undercroft, through most of the tunnels, and I've gotten to the distillery, and that's about as far as I've gotten. But I've followed them down here, and they usually come with a group of guards, four or five strong.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are there sentries? Can we expect to find traps, lookouts?","response":"DM: “It's definitely a possibility, so move quietly. Be careful.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What is Lady Briarwood?","response":"DM: “What is Lady Briarwood? She's a wicked beast of a creature, is what she is. I'd use less savory words, but my brother's here.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: There's a first time for everything, I suppose.","response":"DM: As she leads you guys down the stairs towards the undercroft, she goes, “She's not like her husband. That I know. As far as I can tell, she's human, but she has a very powerful control over life and death. She's a practitioner of the arcane, definitely, but her focus seems to be necromancy on a wide scale. And while Delilah and Sylas are man and wife, they speak of another.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: They speak of another?\nLAURA: The guy that they're trying to bring back.","response":"DM: “It's as if a third party completes their union.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, this is the king that will rise again?","response":"DM: “They don't say any names. They refer to him as 'him' or 'The Whispered One.' No reference beyond that.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)\nSAM: What?\nLAURA: (whispering) What if it's the guy in Percy?\nSAM: What if it's what?\nTALIESIN: I'm having that thought, as well.\nLAURA: Percy's smoke monster.\nSAM: Oh shit.\nMARISHA: Oh boy.\nLIAM: He's playing both sides, possibly, Percival.\nSAM: Oh, another question for Cassandra. The duke, Negmeyer? Vegmeyer? Venkman?\nTALIESIN and MARISHA: Quagmire.","response":"DM: “Vedmire, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Vedmire. Have you seen him around the castle today, or recently?","response":"DM: “I've only seen him in the castle maybe three times since we've been here.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Because Grog? He's a goliath.\nTRAVIS: He's– wait, what?\nSAM: He's a big goliath, so if he's here, you should just, you know–\nTRAVIS: How did you see him?\nSAM: Oh, when I was a dinosaur and I burned down a house and killed a bunch of people…\nTALIESIN: That's a series of words that I know individually, but he strings them together in ways that don't make any sense.\nSAM: I wouldn't say fought, because I beat him really easily, and then I ran away.\nTRAVIS: Oh, you killed him?\nSAM: No, I just pushed him off a building, then I thought that was enough for the day, so I went home.","response":"DM: Cassandra looks over her shoulder at this. “It's a shame you're not as tall as your tales, small one.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, thank you. I'll take that as a compliment.\nTALIESIN: No!\nSAM: Don't worry.\nSAM: Before we cross the precipice into this– what is it, undercroft?","response":"DM: Undercroft she was referring to, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Percival, we all have fought with you this whole time, and you know that we have your back and that we're with you in this 100 percent. But I'd like our enemies to know that, as well, so with your permission, I will cast Seeming on all of us. And I make the girls look like Cassandra, and the boys look like Percy. So I give us all the gray hair.\nTALIESIN: You crazy motherfucker!\nSAM: And if possible, I'd like to emblazon the sign of the rebellion on our chests in sort of an awesome Superman glowing thing.","response":"DM: With a flicker of Scanlan's arcane mastery, all of you form into a small battalion of Percys and Cassandras."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is he a big Percy?","response":"DM: He would have to be, yeah, because he still stays similar to his actual size, so if Percy was a little thicker and a little taller–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Percy's been hitting the 'roids.","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What is Trinket?\nSAM: A bear with two streaks of white hair.\nLAURA: And he's wearing little circle glasses.\nSAM: Yeah, with the little glasses. We are all de Rolos today.\nMARISHA: He's a Hello Trinket!\nTALIESIN: Hello Trinket?\nMARISHA: Hello Trinket.","response":"DM: Cassandra looks around very confused for a second. “Curious, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But abrasive. Right? You're put off by it, so it works. It's working.\nSAM: Possibly confused.\nTALIESIN: Abrasiveness is his most powerful weapon.","response":"DM: “So I'm beginning to see. Well, then.” She pulls her shortsword out. “Shall we?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are we going in to fight now?\nTRAVIS: We're going into the cavern.\nLAURA: I'm stealthing.","response":"DM: “As are we all.” Everyone roll stealth checks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace? Yeah, I'm going to use Pass Without a Trace, because I don't have a lot of 2nd-level spells.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Please.","response":"DM: Plus ten."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, plus ten to your stealth.\nSAM: Oh, really?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: Thank god.\nTRAVIS: Boom!\nLAURA: Natural 20!\nLIAM: You're welcome.\nTRAVIS: 26. Natural 20.\nLIAM: 30. Natural 20.\nLAURA: Oh, natural 20.","response":"DM: 30, plus whatever your bonus is."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's with the bonus.","response":"DM: I thought you rolled a natural 20?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's 29, that's 39.","response":"DM: Oh, you?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 39 for me.","response":"DM: 39? Your sister just out-stealthed you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I gave her my fucking cloak, Matt.\nSAM: Do we all get plus ten?\nTALIESIN: Yeah.\nSAM: Oh, then 29.\nMARISHA: 28.\nTALIESIN: 21.","response":"DM: You all (whoosh) vanish."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Before we go in, I go, Vax?\nLAURA: How do you know it's him?","response":"DM: Solid point."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Vax?\nSAM: Yes, it's me.\nTALIESIN: Yes, Keyleth?\nMARISHA: Vax?\nSAM: Yes, it's me, Vax. What do you need? It's me.\nLIAM: Kiki, I'm over here.\nMARISHA: Goddamn it, Scanlan!\nLAURA: This is really creepy because it's brother and sister talking to each other right now. It looks like Percival and Cassandra.","response":"DM: She's very uncomfortable right now, by the way."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Is there anybody who is not made uncomfortable by this?\nTALIESIN: Of course, Keyleth.\nLAURA: He will be.\nMARISHA: God damn it! I can't do this anymore.\nTALIESIN: Carry on.\nMARISHA: Just go. Let's go. Can we go?\nSAM: Sister Vex? Do you mind giving me that gun again?\nMARISHA: Shut up, Scanlan.\nTALIESIN: It will be no problem at all.\nLAURA: No, you can't have it.\nSAM: Why, because I'm three feet tall?\nLAURA: Because I want it.\nLIAM: (imitating Grog) Is this the body-switching episode?\nTALIESIN: Right.\nSAM: Let's go.\nTALIESIN: Let's go.","response":"DM: Continuing down, a long set of whitestone-constructed stairs descend for about 45 feet before they level off into the de Rolo mausoleum. A long hallway continues forward that contains two ten-by-ten stone structures that contain the entombed bodies of previous generations of de Rolos, with six passages– three on each side– that split off of this main hallway that contain their own stone-encapsulated corpses. This is a place of silent prayer and showing appreciation for the previous families. Not all of them are full, and there were extensions planned as the family grew, but the first thing you notice is all of the tomb doors are open. Is anyone holding a torch light source, going through this?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's got his flaming war hammer.\nMARISHA: Yeah, and I'll light up my hands.\nTALIESIN: I think I still have a torch, actually.","response":"DM: Have you been carrying it with you throughout this?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Dagger.","response":"DM: Okay, so you have enough light sources to keep a general idea of what's going on, and I know a lot of you guys have darkvision, too, so you have a pretty decent range. What's the marching order here, guys? Just so I know, continuing down this path."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We'll go Percy, Cassandra, Cassandra, Percy, Percy, Percy, Percy, Cassandra.\nMARISHA: Boy girl, boy girl, boy girl.\nLAURA: I'm going to perception ahead, so I'll be towards the front.","response":"DM: Towards the front?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How about Grog in second place? You big sponge.","response":"DM: Is Trinket staying with you or staying in back?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's going to stay further back.\nMARISHA: Put me in a happy middle.","response":"DM: Grog's second. Keyleth is, you said, in the middle?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: She's lucky Pierre.\nLAURA: Trinket's staying close to Scanlan.","response":"DM: Okay. Scanlan, you staying towards the back?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I guess so.\nLIAM: I'll be behind Grog, as well.\nTALIESIN: So I'll be in the back with my sister.\nLAURA: Oh no. She's so drunk.","response":"DM: Okay, so it's like a flying V formation you guys are pushing in here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Go home, de Rolo, you're drunk.\nLIAM and LAURA: (make snatching noises)","response":"DM: Yeah, no. Don't go Skyrim on me."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah. Not fun.","response":"DM: Once again, you see the doors are open, and from what you can tell, the stone lids on the tombs are pulled off and to the side. Across the way, as you move towards the center of the room to the second set of openings, you can see the far wall which, the room ends in the far side, but there is about a 15, 20-foot wide and about a ten to 15-foot tall hole burrowed into the far wall. And the closer you get, you see large piles of dirt that fill one side of the room were put off to the side as if pieces of this dig were discarded and there is a trail of dirt across the ground that appears to have not been very well cleaned to show that dirt was being moved in and out of this area. You also see, as you push two-thirds into the room, broken pieces of whitestone that had been carved into what looks like parts of walls or pillars. Support things that failed in their construction and just broke and were tossed and discarded to the side. Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh!\nTALIESIN: Oh! Natural 20.\nSAM: Jesus.\nTRAVIS: What the flipping fuck, man.\nTALIESIN: I had a one today.","response":"DM: A one."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And four 20s.\nTALIESIN: I had a one.","response":"DM: One of you Critters out there has to get Taliesin a really, really pretty new d20 that he has to use going forward."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's shapeways.com.","response":"DM: Not that one!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 29.\nSAM: 12.\nLIAM: 26.\nLAURA: I don't remember. It wasn't very good.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 13.","response":"DM: Okay. Those of you with about 25 or above, you glance and you find two of these slivers of this material you don't recognize and part of this broken stone. It's like a dark green glass. About a half an inch to an inch thick in slivers. You only find a small scattering few, and it has a grainy texture to it, and you take a look at it, and it's transparent. You can see shapes through it, but it's opaque enough to the point where it distorts a little bit of the visual and color behind it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do a nature check on this? Is this similar to the broken glass that I collected before?","response":"DM: Which broken glass you collected before?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I don't know. I just have broken glass shards.\nTRAVIS: I feel like that was the red stones or something from before.\nMARISHA: I feel like there was some sort of–\nTALIESIN: There was that sea of glass.\nMARISHA: Yeah, we were in some cavern.","response":"DM: Oh, the sea of bone and glass? Okay. Yeah, it is not similar to that, no. However, those who are trained in arcana, you can go ahead and make an arcana roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trained in arcana?","response":"DM: Trained in arcana."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How do you know if you're trained in arcana?\nTRAVIS: Negative two.","response":"DM: You would have filled in, if you have a proficiency."}
{"prompt":"SAM: The dot?\nTALIESIN: The dot.\nLAURA: Oh.\nSAM: Oh. 11.","response":"DM: You have really no idea what this glass is."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I grab it back.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That was just me? I'm the only arcana-trained person here?\nLAURA: That's it?\nSAM: Wow. Sorry, guys. Sorry.\nMARISHA: Can I try a nature check on it?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He's like, “It's not going to tell you shit, but sure.” 15?","response":"DM: It's glass. Most glass you understand is designed by usually sand or other materials that at a high temperature or some sort of process is melted and fused."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So it's manufactured.","response":"DM: It appears to be, or naturally occurred, and the structure of it has this bumpy, wavy– it's not like smooth glass."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Like when lightning hits sand?","response":"DM: Kind of. But you're not sure what it actually is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I wonder if this was holding that acid.\nTALIESIN: I wonder if something very, very hot…\nMARISHA: I'm wondering if it's a symptom of something.\nSAM: When they burn the whitestone with the acid or something?\nLAURA: Do I see any recent tracks around here? Does it look like people came down here?","response":"DM: Make a survival check with advantage because you're a crazy ranger tracker."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 13.","response":"DM: You see tracks here and there, some fresher than others. Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How many of us found this?","response":"DM: Well, two of you saw it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I've got one.","response":"DM: Yeah, you've got one piece."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And Percy's got the other?","response":"DM: Second piece, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You want to burn one?\nLIAM: I walk away from the group all the way to the back, and I take it–","response":"DM: To where you came from?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, towards where we came from. What's behind us? Is it just tunnel back that way?","response":"DM: You mean on that path you're going?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I push through the back of the group to the back.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What's behind us?","response":"DM: Where you just came from is the stairs that lead up to the castle."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I was going to throw it, but…\nTRAVIS: I see Vex looking around. Can I look for tracks as well? I'm proficient in survival, and I never use it.","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Natural 20! I swear to god.","response":"DM: While you sit there inspecting the dirt–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It looks like there's some tracks here, but I don't know what it's saying.","response":"DM: Grog, you immediately see a cluster of recent footprints, probably a day old at most, that lead in towards the tunnel. Looks like the prints are of seven individuals. Feet are fairly wide, masculine and heavy in step. One gait appears to be smaller, thinner, and more feminine."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: How many tombs are open around us?","response":"DM: Eight total in this room."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Should we check the tombs?\nLAURA: They're already open and empty.\nSAM: They're open and empty.","response":"DM: You all make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: All of us?\nSAM: Ten.\nMARISHA: 28.\nTALIESIN: 25.\nLIAM: 20.\nLAURA: 11.\nTRAVIS: 18.","response":"DM: Okay, 20 and above that'd be just you two?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20.\nTALIESIN: Damn it!\nMARISHA: God damn it! Here we go again.\nLIAM: We've got company.","response":"DM: There's one round that you three get to act. The rest of you have a surprise round right now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What kind of mist?\nSAM: Bad deadly ghost mist.\nMARISHA: What kind of mist?\nSAM: A miasma.","response":"DM: Grog and Vex are out here checking this. You guys are back here. Keyleth is here. Vax, you're back here. Trinket's up with you, and Scanlan you're–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I was in the back.","response":"DM: So you're over here with these guys. You see one drifts out from this side, another drifts out from this side, and another drifts in from this side."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Undead ghoulie guys?\nLIAM: Ghosts. Wraiths.\nMARISHA: Wraiths?","response":"DM: There is a cold chill that runs down the spine of Keyleth and Vax, as they've encountered enemies similar to this in the past."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's that fucking shit that turned us.\nTRAVIS: Just those three, right?","response":"DM: Just those three."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I feel like an asshole.\nMARISHA: Shut the fuck up!\nTALIESIN: I feel like an asshole.\nMARISHA: Get out!\nTALIESIN: I'm changing dice. This is bullshit.","response":"DM: Yeah, I'm banning that d20 for the rest of the game."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm changing dice.\nMARISHA: It makes no sense. Yes! It's a hollow die.\nTALIESIN: It's a hollow die. There's nothing to be weighted on it. It's a wiffle die.\nMARISHA: And I rolled a one!","response":"DM: So it's just you. Okay, so! Initiatives."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 28.","response":"DM: (giggles) Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 14.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 15.\nTALIESIN: Thank you for that.\nTALIESIN: I yell, “Look out!” And I take several steps toward Vax.","response":"DM: To there?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Actually, on the other side of the pillar so I can actually see the one that's getting towards him.","response":"DM: There?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: You won't be able to see this one, just those. This one actually will block your view to that one. These are about ten feet tall. These are the little sections here, so right now, you would be able to see these two here and barely see this one. It would have three-quarters cover. Which you ignore, with Sharpshooter."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I know. I want to back up into that corner, though, just to get away from them.","response":"DM: Over here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, so you can see one of them right now."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll take– fuck. Yep, screw it. I'll take shots with the Pepperbox.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll take my first shot.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That can't be right. Just checking. 20. Natural 20.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: With a different dice?\nTALIESIN: With a different die. Of course, with a different die.\nMARISHA: Shut the fuck up!\nTRAVIS: Who are you?\nTALIESIN: I'm the devil. I am the devil, and I have come to do the devil's work.","response":"DM: So all of you who are going to conventions to meet Taliesin in the future, make sure you get a nice long hold of his hand so you can roll better, too."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, would you touch my dice?\nTALIESIN: I will lick your die, because that is how I bless them.\nTALIESIN: First attack.","response":"DM: Both at the same guy?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, all against the same guy.","response":"DM: Okay. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: First attack is 22 points of damage.","response":"DM: Okay, is this with the element, or not?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, no element.","response":"DM: Okay. You fire. Just passes through it with no effect."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, fucking misty dudes.\nTRAVIS: What?\nMARISHA: Damn misty dudes. I'm mocking them.\nTALIESIN: I spin.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Shoot with fire.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What the fuck?!\nMARISHA: Get out!","response":"DM: Take a picture. Take a picture right now."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Taking a picture.\nMARISHA: Get out! You're the anti-Wheaton.\nSAM: He's had, like, eight tonight.\nMARISHA: How many is that?\nTALIESIN: I don't know!\nMARISHA: CritRoleStats, how many is that? Tell us! I know you've been counting.\nLAURA: Ridiculous.\nSAM: Go to Vegas!\nTALIESIN: I'll put it on Instagram later.\nMARISHA: Go to Vegas!\nLAURA: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: I go to Vegas. I don't gamble!\nLAURA: We need to go.","response":"DM: You need to go find the D&D casino."}
{"prompt":"SAM: D&D casino?","response":"DM: D&D casino. Make it happen, guys. I know one of you can."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This is fire elemental.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 14 points of damage, plus three damage of fire.","response":"DM: That's including crit damage?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Including the crit damage. I rolled really poorly on my damage.","response":"DM: Okay, so this one, the bullet does (impact noise) hit its form with a burst of flame, the bullet converted to magical due to the nature of the chamber. You can see its form (raspy cry). It disperses for a second and then re-forms, continuing its movement."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We need magic! I'm taking my last shot.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That was seven, by the way. Seven 20s this game.","response":"DM: That's stupid."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, see? That's better. 15.","response":"DM: 15 does hit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm out.","response":"DM: Okay, that ends your turn. It's now their go. This one drifts forward to Keyleth. This one drifts forward to Grog."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's with our surprise round? You said we have a surprise round.","response":"DM: No, you guys were aware. Everyone else is surprised."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, we're the only three that aren't surprised. Oh, that sucks.","response":"DM: So. Unless you do anything against surprise?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Not unless I'm raging.\nMARISHA: A charisma saving throw? That's not great. And no saving throw bonuses, okay, so that's ten?\nLIAM: (quietly) Oh, she's gone.\nMARISHA: We've been here before.","response":"DM: Did you roll already?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I did.","response":"DM: What did you get?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Ten.","response":"DM: Ten. Okay. The ghost reaches out and embraces Keyleth. It disappears into her form and she shivers for a second, and it is no longer visible."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, he's taken over her body?","response":"DM: Keyleth's eyes all of a sudden flare up with a ghostly blue glow, and she turns around, looking at the group with a hunger you haven't seen in her eyes. For those who see it, as well– I should have made this happen before– I need you guys to immediately after seeing these ghosts make a wisdom saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What for?\nSAM: Everyone?","response":"DM: No, just the ones that see it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're all immune to fear because of the feast.","response":"DM: That's right, so never mind. That doesn't matter."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Charisma saving throw?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.\nMARISHA: This isn't a charm thing?","response":"DM: And Grog, charisma saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is this charm?","response":"DM: Nope. This is not a charm."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so a 12 for me. Am I caught, as well?\nSAM: 12?","response":"DM: 12?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: God damn it.\nSAM: That was your last Luck, too.\nLIAM: No, that's two, isn't it?\nMARISHA: You did two.\nLAURA: We're going to die!\nTRAVIS: Grog is batting for the other team.","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Four.\nLAURA: (muffled) We don't even have a cleric with us!\nSAM: Wait, this is against charisma?\nLAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.\nSAM: Jesus.","response":"DM: And with that, three of your teammates turn around, their eyes intensely glowing with some sort of a weird ghostly glow."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Three v three, man. Battle royale. Let's do this.\nTALIESIN: Oh god.\nSAM: Wait, we have to fight them?\nMARISHA: He's going to call it at eight. He's going to call it.","response":"DM: Everyone else roll initiative."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We have to fight them. How is that going to happen?\nTALIESIN: This is going to go so poorly.\nTRAVIS: Not us. Not the possessed ones, right?","response":"DM: No, you guys are already on the initiative. Oh, no. Grog, you still do."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I still roll initiative?","response":"DM: Yeah, for yourself."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What?\nTRAVIS: I'm possessed, though.\nTALIESIN: Roll your initiative.\nLIAM: What just happened?\nLAURA: You have to roll initiative to see when you attack all of us.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well, then it's good it was a one.\nMARISHA: Do we roll initiative, too? We're re-rolling initiative, the three of us?","response":"DM: Everyone who hasn't rolled yet rolls now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh.\nSAM: 15.","response":"DM: 15. Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Unless I have to roll with advantage.\nSAM: Do you have to roll with advantage?","response":"DM: Technically, you would, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Two.\nLAURA: 13.\nMARISHA: Help us!\nTALIESIN: I don't know what to do.\nLAURA: We don't have a cleric!\nSAM: You have– ugh.\nMARISHA: I think you guys–\nSAM: No, it's up to us to figure out, right?\nLAURA: He cast Turn Undead. We don't have that.\nMARISHA: Was that when Kashaw was here?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: That was Kashaw. Yeah, he cast Turn Undead.\nTRAVIS: Awesome. He's not here right now. What are you going to do?\nTALIESIN: Okay! What are we going to do?","response":"DM: What are you going to do?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Does Cassandra have any–\nTALIESIN: That's my first action. I'm going to use my bonus action to turn to my sister and go, what the hell do we do?","response":"DM: She looks at you, a little bit frustrated."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Please tell me she trained in cleric. Please tell me she multiclassed.","response":"DM: She looks about, annoyed, and goes, “I'm sorry. I'm not a holy woman. I have no symbols. I have no power. I have nothing. Let's see what we can do.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You guys have that holy water, right?\nTALIESIN: I'm backing up. I'm going to do my best to back up into the tomb right here.","response":"DM: Right there?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Keep going to my right until the drop-off behind me, and I'm going to back up into the tomb.","response":"DM: Okay. Into there?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, up. Towards you; the other side.","response":"DM: There we go."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: There we go. I'm putting my back against the wall.","response":"DM: Okay, so you're up against the stone?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I mean that column.\nMARISHA: Take the damn laser pointer.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, there.","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah!\nTALIESIN: I'm unloading two shots. I'm reloading and unloading two magical shots at Vax.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to burn some fucking points. What am I going to do?\nSAM: We're fucked!\nTRAVIS: Do your worst.\nTALIESIN: First shot– fuck it, I'm using the old die. I've already rolled two 20s on that one. First shot, I'm shooting to get Vax to drop his knives.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Burning a grit point to drop his knife.\nMARISHA: Good idea!","response":"DM: He has two, so you only knock–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: One of them out of his hand. The one that doesn't auto-return.\nLIAM: They all do.\nTALIESIN: They all do?\nLIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: That crazy belt, man."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Shooting him in the face. Fuck it. And my gun jams. You did that!\nMARISHA: I touched it. I'm sorry!\nTALIESIN: (frustrated noise)","response":"DM: So that's your turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yep.\nLIAM: The first was a 13. The second was a 22.","response":"DM: Pretty sure the 22 hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 22 hits.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage against Percy."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Eight.\nSAM: Check?\nTALIESIN: Oh yeah!\nMARISHA: Come on.\nTALIESIN: Magic fingers.\nLAURA: Magic glove.\nMARISHA: Do you want Taliesin to lick it?\nLIAM: 18.","response":"DM: 18? That gentle glow left behind, that slight sliver of Pike's essence that went into your symbol of Sarenrae, flares for a second. It flares again, and for a moment, in your head, in which darkness has taken your vision, you feel your body moving on its own, but you have no control. You hear Pike's voice whisper in your ear from a distance. It says, “Vax? It's okay.” At which point, suddenly you feel the coldness sucked out from you. The symbol flares for a second, and the ghost is thrust out of your form."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (excited shout)\nTALIESIN: Yeah!\nSAM: I read my Scroll of Spirit Guardians. I call them forth to protect us in this moment.\nTALIESIN: Treguna mekoides–\nSAM: Hakuna matata.\nTALIESIN: Trecorum satis dee.\nSAM: I don't know how this works.","response":"DM: That's okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (silly voice) They attack bad things around me, and they don't like bad things, so I thought maybe that would be good.\nSAM: Spirit Guardians. The thing I bought from Gilmore. Right? Didn't I buy the Scroll of Spirit Guardians?\nLAURA: Yeah, you did.\nSAM: They attack anything evil within 15 feet of me.","response":"DM: Indeed."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Necrotic damage.","response":"DM: There we go: Spirit Guardians. So you call forth spirits to protect you for the duration, for up to ten minutes. Your alignment is…?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Good?","response":"DM: Good, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Good-ish. Sort of devious good.","response":"DM: Okay, so here's what you do. You actually use this to create these guardians– this spell hasn't been used, either. To a distance of 15 feet. You have to choose things within 15 feet of you, so you have these two right here."}
{"prompt":"SAM: They're both within 15 feet of me, aren't they?","response":"DM: So, these guys. Their speed is halved."}
{"prompt":"SAM: When they take their turn, they get 3d8 damage.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's a very confusing spell.","response":"DM: Yeah, when they move within 15 feet of you, their speed is halved, and at the start or when they enter the area, they make a wisdom saving throw or take radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is that now or when they move?","response":"DM: That will be at the end of their turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yay, radiant damage. That's awesome.\nSAM: I know.\nTALIESIN: You made a good call.\nTRAVIS: Nice, dude.\nSAM: Do I get a bonus action?","response":"DM: You get a bonus action, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Who's not undead right now? You? I've already inspired you once. Sure, I'll inspire you again. I've got nothing. This time, I'll just go, (harmonica noises).\nLAURA: I feel really inspired.\nTALIESIN: (squeaking noise)\nMARISHA: Did you just squeak?\nTALIESIN: Maybe. You don't know. Shut up!","response":"DM: So it turns towards Scanlan, having cast that, and you make a staff attack against him."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (grunts)\nSAM: I do a little doo-wop. (vocalizes) And that's my Cutting Words to try to distract her from her attack.","response":"DM: Okay. Go for it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I rolled a 19.\nSAM: Do I roll now?","response":"DM: Yeah, you roll a d10 and subtract that from her attack."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I rolled a 19.\nSAM: Two.","response":"DM: So it's a 17."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What's your AC?\nSAM: I have a 17 armor class.","response":"DM: Roll damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, wait! No, that's a ten. That's right.\nMARISHA: It's not a lot of damage, I promise. Oh, see? Even better. Four damage.\nSAM: Oh. I shouldn't have even wasted it.\nTALIESIN: It's “ow.”\nLAURA: It's just your little staff?\nSAM: You're adorable.\nMARISHA: I'm still doing my granny routine.","response":"DM: Okay, now it has to make a wisdom saving throw, which it succeeds. It still takes half as much damage, so roll 3d8."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Who, me?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh. Yes. Of course I will. I will do that right now with these d8s that I have. 12.\nMARISHA: 12 points?","response":"DM: Yep. Vex, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god! Am I close by him?","response":"DM: You are. You're right next to him."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm right next to him?","response":"DM: You're right there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no! I back away from him. He's going to get an attack on me.","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But I really needed to put some distance there.","response":"DM: Make an attack of opportunity."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait! Okay, that's good.\nTRAVIS: 13.\nLAURA: You don't hit me!","response":"DM: Whiff. (impact noise) The hammer hits the side of the stonework, cracking it a little."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, that's my mausoleum.","response":"DM: What are you doing, Vex?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to have Trinket– is he lined up with anybody?","response":"DM: Just Keyleth right now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He can't cannonball through to Grog and Keyleth?","response":"DM: He can, but he'll hit Scanlan, as well."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can you dodge, Scanlan?\nSAM: We'll see. Let's do this. I always loved that bear.\nLAURA: Right! You deserve it. He's doing it.","response":"DM: We'll say Trinket backs up a little bit to get enough room on it. Keyleth, swing an attack."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, to Trinket?","response":"DM: Yeah. Trinket has to get enough distance to actually build up momentum."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I think that hits. 20 total?","response":"DM: 20 total is exactly the AC. Roll damage for Trinket."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's okay. It's not a lot. Nine?","response":"DM: Trinket takes nine points of bludgeoning damage from the staff."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Halved?","response":"DM: Right, yeah, because it's bludgeoning, so five points. Trinket then rolls forward, (thudding noises). Roll attacks on Grog, Scanlan, and Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Trinket bowling.\nLAURA: Eight plus 16 is 24.","response":"DM: For who? Keyleth, Scanlan, and Grog."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, so Keyleth is 24.\nMARISHA: Hits.\nLAURA: Scanlan is 18.\nSAM: Hits.\nLAURA: And Grog is 18.\nTRAVIS: Misses.\nLAURA: No, Grog is 20.\nTRAVIS: Hits.\nLAURA: I don't know what to roll for cannonball damage because I've never actually gotten to hit.","response":"DM: Oh, I know. I have this. It's 2d6 plus four."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. For each person?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, okay, so ten for Keyleth.","response":"DM: Ten points of bludgeoning damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Seven plus four is 11 for Scanlan.\nSAM: Okay.\nLAURA: Oh, less for Grog. Eight.","response":"DM: Eight points of damage for Grog."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And while he's doing– I don't get to shoot an arrow. Yes, I do! I get to shoot an arrow.","response":"DM: Bonus."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to shoot an arrow as Trinket is hitting Grog.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god. 14 doesn't hit him.","response":"DM: Nope. It hits the shoulder and gleans off and carves a little wound across his chest, but not enough to do any damage. That ends your turn. Grog."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And now Trinket is close to me, then. Did he go through them and get back to me?","response":"DM: Trinket, due to the line, slams into Grog at the end of it, so he is now between the three others."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shit.","response":"DM: Grog. As a ghost, you just got shot and slammed by a bear. I want you to roll one d20."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, he's going to see if he raged.\nTRAVIS: 15.","response":"DM: 15. Your attention goes to Vex, as opposed to Trinket. You move out of the way."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And he takes 3d8.","response":"DM: That's true."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Eight plus nine is 17.","response":"DM: Well, the creature has to make a wisdom save. Fails, so yeah, takes 3d8. Yep."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 17.","response":"DM: 17."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17 to hit?\nSAM: No, I just hit you with 17 points of damage.\nTRAVIS: Okay.\nLAURA: Shit.\nTRAVIS: Oh, that's not awesome. That's 17.\nLAURA: Doesn't hit.\nTRAVIS: That does. 24.","response":"DM: Yeah. Go ahead and roll damage. The first hammer swing you're ready for. Swing backward. It goes long."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Grog! Grog, no. No!\nTRAVIS: 20 on the first.","response":"DM: 20 points of damage. (impact noise) First one didn't hit, did it?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The first one didn't hit, so you only get the 20.\nTRAVIS: Oh, just the 20!","response":"DM: Just 20, so as the first one misses, you pull back, trying to stop him, but the hammer still slams you in the side; you don't have time to move out of the way, and it pushes you up against the wall. You land on your feet, and you can feel the pulsing of the blood broken beneath the skin. That ends Grog's go. Percy, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (gasps, sighs) “Hi!” I saw what just happened, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to try to fix my gun.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That fixes.\nTALIESIN: (sighs) Are you better? Good, then let's deal with this. I'm going to start diving around the columns to get away from the wraith.","response":"DM: Around here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, because I don't have a shot this round.","response":"DM: Okay, so you move around that way."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, cool.\nTALIESIN: That ends my turn.","response":"DM: It's now their turn. This one currently loses interest in you and drifts two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight– it (whoosh) passes through the stone. Moves through and appears on the other side. I need you to make a charisma saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have advantage on charisma saving throws right now, do I not?\nLAURA: Oh, yeah, because she cast–\nMARISHA: It's not there anymore. Sorry.","response":"DM: Yeah. She dropped it when she picked up the concentration spell."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Roll high, golden snitch.","response":"DM: And that was ability checks, not saving throws."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, then never mind. What's my charisma saving– oh boy. Nope. I rolled a natural one. You did this! This is the third natural one. You touched it.\nLAURA: That's why I'm superstitious about my dice.\nMARISHA: I touched it.\nLAURA: He also touched mine, and I rolled a three.\nTALIESIN: I'll come back to you after Thanksgiving, baby.\nLIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: You still feel the residual warmth in your glove pulsing."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Towards Percy. Shit. I'm going to take the keen dagger and stick it into his gut, and I'm going to take the glove with the symbol of Sarenrae and punch him in the nose.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I like that you're violent instead of just going, “Healing hand.”\nMARISHA: Yeah!\nLAURA: You go, “fuck you!”\nSAM: Can I just say, this is Percy beating up Percy right now.","response":"DM: Yeah. You're being attacked and stabbed by yourself. It's weird."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20 for the dagger.\nTALIESIN: I'm not reading too much into this.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The punch is just strength modifier, right?\nTALIESIN: This is not a metaphor!\nLIAM: 17 for the punch.\nTALIESIN: 18.","response":"DM: 18. Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Nine.","response":"DM: You take nine points of piercing damage as the dagger stabs into your stomach. As you swing to haul the punch off, the body ducks out of the way."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Take the punch!\nLIAM: Wait. How far did I go?","response":"DM: You were there, so that's 15 feet."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I want to spring back and run as far as I can in the other direction, around the corner towards the rest.\nSAM: I walk between Grog and Keyleth, maintaining my 15-foot distance. Even more between.","response":"DM: There?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah, and I'll Thunderwave them both. Oh no, and I hit Trinket.\nTRAVIS: Do we roll something?\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 12.","response":"DM: (thud) Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I rolled an 18.","response":"DM: What's your DC?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 19.\nLAURA: You have a constitution saving throw of eight.\nTRAVIS: Oh. 26.","response":"DM: Okay, so you take half damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket rolled an 11.","response":"DM: Okay. (thud)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Eight points of damage.","response":"DM: Okay, so you take eight points of damage. Grog takes four. Trinket takes eight."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are we trying to kill our friends, here?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, get us.\nLAURA: Get them unconscious so they come out. But then if they're unconscious, the ghosts come out and they could possess us.\nSAM: That's great.\nMARISHA: But they take radiant damage.","response":"DM: Keyleth, top of the turn, roll–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Did I get radiant damage from that push?\nSAM: No.","response":"DM: You take 3d8 points of radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I do.\nSAM: From the spirit guardians. Oh, and I'll also inspire Vax. (sings) Rip out someone's tongue and I'll know you. Cure someone dead and I'll show you've got those moves with dagger. You've got those moves with dagger. You've got those–\nALL: (sings) Moves like dagger.\nSAM: Okay. 13.\nMARISHA: 62 hit points.\nMARISHA: Yeah?","response":"DM: You turn around as you see Vax rush up with a look of fear and intensity on his face. You see her turn around with this twisted grin on her face, and she brings her staff up and swings it towards your head. Roll an attack."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (whoosh) Baseball. 17.","response":"DM: What's your AC?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It is 18.","response":"DM: 18. As she swings, you duck, and her staff (impact noise) smacks against the stone wall of the mausoleum. That ends your turn, bringing us to Vex."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And I'm in a fight with Grog.","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. This is totally awesome.\nSAM: Wait! We have Cass. Does she get a turn?\nLAURA: She's not doing anything.","response":"DM: I forgot to add her to the initiative. That's my own fault."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I just thought she was being a bitch.","response":"DM: I'll give her a couple of rounds here in a second. Anyway, finish up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket runs forward and tries to pull Grog's focus so that I can back away.","response":"DM: Okay, so Trinket moves up to there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He tries to grapple him, or something. Can he do anything to make Grog not be able to attack me if I run away? Can he try to knock him down, or something? Jump up on his back and knock him over.","response":"DM: Use an action to make a trip attack. Sure, why not. Roll an athletics check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Yeah, no problem.\nTALIESIN: I'm imagining a bear doing mild calisthenics.\nLAURA: An athletics check for me?","response":"DM: No, for Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. 12?","response":"DM: Make a strength saving throw, Grog."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's a 26.","response":"DM: Yeah, Trinket rushes over and tries to knock you off your feet, and you just (thud) no effect. You still have a bonus action and your movement, if you want to."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to try to roll out of the way. I'm going to try to duck down and roll out of the way to make him less likely to hit me.\nSAM: Yeah! The old “less likely” trick.","response":"DM: Make an acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Oh, my dice suck tonight!\nSAM: You're inspired.\nMARISHA: He's sucking up all the good energy.\nLAURA: That's good! Acrobatics. 28.","response":"DM: 28? Grog, roll an attack with disadvantage, just for the hell of it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 23.","response":"DM: Okay, roll damage against Vex as she pulls away from you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The first one was a natural 20.","response":"DM: Be glad it was disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 21.","response":"DM: You take 21 points of bludgeoning damage. As you pull away, Grog (whack) backhands you with his hammer. Now you can take your bonus action, if you want to."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: As my bonus action, I'm going to cast–\nTRAVIS: Kill Goliath.\nLAURA: Right? I don't want to use any of my shit!\nTRAVIS: Can you conjure a keg of beer?\nSAM: That would distract you.\nLAURA: I can't, but that's a really good idea. For my bonus action, I'm going to go, help!\nSAM: You can use your bonus action to throw me the gun!\nLAURA: Oh. No.\nTRAVIS: 19.","response":"DM: 19. She goes to strike and whiffs, unfortunately. She's going to attack with her dagger she pulls out in her off hand. Rolls a three. Yeah. I'm giving her a second round because I missed the one. She's going to angrily pull up again and attempt to strike with both a second time. That will be a 20."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That hits.\nLAURA: Yay! Oh, she's a rogue.\nLIAM: Rogue.","response":"DM: So you take 27 points of piercing damage. Well, it's slashing damage from the shortsword. The offhand attack is another three. Going to miss."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay.\nTRAVIS: 11.","response":"DM: 11. Your attention switches to Cassandra. Roll two attacks."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I get my radiant damage on him?","response":"DM: At the top of his turn, you do, yeah. Actually, before that happens, roll radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 21.\nTRAVIS: 21 points?","response":"DM: With that, as you're reeling up your hammer to strike Cassandra, a burst of radiant energy disintegrates the ghostly presence within your body, and you find your mind come to you as you're about to go into a downswing to smash Cassandra's head in. You catch yourself."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do it anyway, Grog!\nMARISHA: Don't!\nSAM: She's one of us.","response":"DM: You have your turn now."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, I have my turn?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Grog, I know you don't know what's going on right now, but kill Keyleth!\nTRAVIS: Okay. I turn and walk over to Keyleth.","response":"DM: Over Cassandra."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Poor Cass.\nTRAVIS: I'm going to swing my hammer at the middle of her chest.\nSAM: Oh, you're scary. She's so cute.\nTRAVIS: 15.","response":"DM: What's your AC, Keyleth?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 18.","response":"DM: She ducks out of the way with this preternatural speed."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Wow. 16.\nMARISHA: (cackles)","response":"DM: Keyleth's ghostly form is too fast for you. The confusion of the whole sequence caused you to not be able to think straight in the moment, and you miss twice. That ends your turn, Grog. Percy."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, right. Percy's still–\nSAM: Jesus. And he's got guns.","response":"DM: Your gun was just fixed, correct?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.\nTALIESIN: Would he use the gun or the sword in phantom mode?","response":"DM: You just finished fixing this, and you have a gun before you. It's going to use it. Make three attacks against Vex– Vax. I mean Vax."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to use this die, because it's been–\nMARISHA: Failing? Yeah, I touched it. Use the one that I touched.\nTALIESIN: That's– I can't talk. 21.\nLIAM: That hits, but what's applicable? Uncanny Dodge or Evasion for a gunshot?","response":"DM: Whatever reduces the damage to half. It's not a saving throw, so it would be– which one reduces the damage by half?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's Uncanny Dodge.\nTALIESIN: 21.","response":"DM: Hits. And?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 26.","response":"DM: So you take seven damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Fuck me. 15.","response":"DM: 15 piercing damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And 11.","response":"DM: Okay. (three gunshots)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We are so strong! We should never fight ourselves.\nLIAM: Am I able to slide around Keyleth closer to you, into that little alcove, or am I too pressed against the wall? The other way.","response":"DM: Currently, it's just enemies, so you can't move past them."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: I could make you roll an acrobatics check, if you wanted."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Pommels of the daggers.\nSAM: Kiss or kill.\nLIAM: 18.","response":"DM: Are you doing sneak attack on this? She's adjacent to Grog, so yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Definitely.","response":"DM: 18 hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Second one is 20.\nMARISHA: Hits.","response":"DM: They both hit, so roll damage on both."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And then 32 on the last.","response":"DM: Oh, that's right. So three hits, with sneak attack."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, sneak attack is going to take me down.\nLIAM: Three. Plus seven is ten. And the ten gets doubled? Or everything?\nMARISHA: Dice rolls get doubled.\nLIAM: Ten, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 50.\nSAM: 50?\nLIAM: 50 for the first hit.","response":"DM: Was it doubled because you rolled a critical?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Sneak Attack.","response":"DM: Sneak Attack, you just roll the dice."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, then no. 25.","response":"DM: 25."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Thank you.","response":"DM: No worries."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Plus nine, plus nine.","response":"DM: Okay, so 25 plus 18…"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 38.\nMARISHA: 38? Okay.","response":"DM: 25 plus 18 is 43."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 43?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What was I at just now?\nSAM: 62. So you're at 19.\nMARISHA: 19 hit points.\nLIAM: I'm going to use– I don't care. I'm going to slide around Grog, to the side. Towards Scanlan. Right there, yeah.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What's up, brother?\nSAM: I'm up again?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.\nSAM: Okay. Thank you for moving, Vax. I'm going to blast them both with lightning. Straight shot through, 100 feet.","response":"DM: Through those two? Yeah. Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah. What do I do? 8d6?","response":"DM: 8d6, and I need Keyleth and Percy to both make dexterity saving throws."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Just the two of us? I actually have disadvantage on dexterity stuff because of corruption. 20 for me.\nTALIESIN: 21.","response":"DM: You both take half damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 24.","response":"DM: You both take 12 points of lightning damage. The bolt strikes through, hitting both of you in the chest, but you both manage to pull out of the way just in time to reduce the impact of the spell."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And as a bonus action, I'll do a Healing Word on Vex. Right? You're injured badly?\nLAURA: I mean, not badly, but–\nSAM: Oh, well then fuck it. Oh, you're injured badly? Would I know that?","response":"DM: You could glance over and look at him as he pulls up to you, and see him (pants)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I've got gunshots in my back.\nSAM: Okay. Yeah, so I'll Healing Word.","response":"DM: Roll the healing points for that."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What is it? Shit. It's right here: d4 plus five. That's it?! So lame. Seven points.\nSAM: Ooh, yes. Oh, this is going to knock you out.\nMARISHA: Hopefully.\nSAM: That's nine already.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I'm down.\nSAM: Six more is 15.\nMARISHA: Nope. Six.\nLAURA: I see the ghost come out of her? Okay, I'm going to shoot it with my Blazing Bowstring.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 16?","response":"DM: 16 hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 17. I want a good one. 17. 25.","response":"DM: 25. As you pull back the arrow and you see the flames ignite around the shaft, you release it. It slams into the ghost, and you see its form (raspy cry) disperse from the impact, the arrow hitting the wall behind it and shattering against the stone. Ghost destroyed."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: For my second attack, I'm going to attack Percy. Can I see him?","response":"DM: Yep, right over there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (ghost noises)\nLAURA: 16.","response":"DM: 16 points of damage to you, Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 16?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Cool.\nLAURA: That was also through my Blazing Bowstring.","response":"DM: So you're using both Blazing Bowstring abilities right now?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay. A flaming arrow (impact noise) sticks into the shoulder, and you can feel the flames burning into your body–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Plus another five. That was another five burning damage.\nTRAVIS: 21.\nTALIESIN: 21?","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm still doing fine.\nMARISHA: I hate these things.","response":"DM: It's now Cass's turn. Cass, who's having a weird time with the whole process of seeing a bunch of herselves and her brothers stabbing each other and getting possessed."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How do we even know who's who?\nMARISHA: Stop hitting yourself!\nTALIESIN: Thank you for that. I was almost going there.","response":"DM: She's right there, and she brings herself around the way. She's not able to do any actions, so she sees another of her brothers possessed but clutching the gun in the hand, and is steeling her blade for the moment and doesn't do anything with her turn. Grog, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: “Percy!” And I run towards him.\nTALIESIN: (creepy voice) I'll swallow your soul!\nTRAVIS: 25.\nTALIESIN: Is no one a Sam Raimi fan? Never mind.\nSAM: That was Donald Duck, right?\nTRAVIS: 18?","response":"DM: What's your armor class?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 18.","response":"DM: Yeah, hits. Damage on both."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17 for the first one. 19 for the second one.","response":"DM: Okay, so 36 points of damage. (two impacts) You're thrown up against the wall and almost pushed over off your feet from the sheer weight of the impact."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It has to be magic damage, though.\nLAURA: It was. It's a magic war hammer.\nTALIESIN: Okay, so it's taking damage, too. That's good. Maybe.\nMARISHA: They have to be spells.\nTRAVIS: There was fire damage.","response":"DM: Yeah. It seems that the radiant damage from the Spirit Guardian spell you're doing has been doing the bulk of damage to them while they're inside the form. Most everything else is going straight to the individual."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS and SAM: Oh shit!\nSAM: We've just been killing our friends for no reason?\nLAURA: Good times.\nTRAVIS: Let's pass our–\nSAM: Hold our wrath.","response":"DM: Percy. You have three more shots with this gun, two of which are magical."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I do.","response":"DM: So you pull up the gun, you take a step back."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Does he get an attack of opportunity?","response":"DM: You do. Attack of opportunity against Percy, if you want to take it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Come on, take him down.\nLAURA: Oh no!\nTRAVIS: That's a natural 20.\nTALIESIN: Yes!","response":"DM: Roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's actually the first time I've critted on this show.","response":"DM: You get additional dice."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It does additional damage.","response":"DM: It's the first time you've critically hit on this show?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I think so, because I've never doubled my dice.","response":"DM: That's absurd."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I know. 14.\nTALIESIN: 14? I'm already out.","response":"DM: Roll damage. I want to know what it is."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, go ahead, but I'm out.\nTRAVIS: 18, so– what was the first one? 18 and?\nMARISHA: You said 14.","response":"DM: Okay. You are out. Percy falls to the ground, unconscious. The spirit is jettisoned out the side. That ends your turn entirely. The ghost is going to shift over. It does not get its possession back."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It was just a crit. It wasn't hit twice.\nMARISHA: It wasn't when he was down.","response":"DM: Percy, I need you to make a death saving throw, by the way."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yay!","response":"DM: Okay. The ghost gets pushed out of the body. With you on the ground and its possession not returned, it reaches down and strikes at you with its withering touch."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of–\nMARISHA: With its withering touch?","response":"DM: You take two death saving throw losses."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Whoa!\nLAURA: He rolled a crit?","response":"DM: It's an auto-crit because he's unconscious."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise!\nMARISHA: But you passed your first one.\nTALIESIN: I passed my first one.\nMARISHA: So you have two failures on you?\nTALIESIN: I have two failures and one success. So guys? Heal me. Heal me now.","response":"DM: Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I start sprinting around that open hallway near Cassandra. I stop by Cassandra and dagger, dagger, dagger.","response":"DM: Do it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: First one is 30. Second one is 15. Third is 28.","response":"DM: All three hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: They all hit? Good. Ten plus seven is 17. 27 total.","response":"DM: 27 damage, total?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: All magic.\nSAM: I vault over Keyleth–\nLIAM: Wait. I ran 20 feet? 30 feet?","response":"DM: You were here, so 35."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 35? Can I run the “west” of the way–\nLAURA: The “west” of the way?\nLIAM: The “west” of the way through it in front of Percy. Yeah.","response":"DM: There? You can, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's what I want to do.\nSAM: I vault over Keyleth's body, using the right part of a buttcheek to launch off. Grab a little feel as I go.","response":"DM: Creepy gnome."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I try to get within 15 feet of the thing.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And as my first thing, I will Healing Word Mr. Taliesin Jaffe. Percival de Rolo de Monico de Chico…\nTALIESIN: (sings) It's delightful, it's de-lovely.\nSAM: Just at normal level, so that's nine points.\nTALIESIN: Thank you!","response":"DM: Your death saving throws are fine."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Nine. Nine points! Ah-ah-ah.\nSAM: Jesus. I don't want to burn another fucking thing on this guy.\nTALIESIN: Your aura thingy with 15 feet should do it.\nSAM: I know, but that's when he moves, not when I move, so I will mock him! I will say, you're not even corporeal. You have no substance. You're a nothing. You're a nobody! You won't amount to nothing in this world!","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 19.","response":"DM: It fails its save. Roll 3d4."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Kill it, Scanlan. Kill it.\nSAM: Six.\nTRAVIS: A mocking kill!\nSAM: (giggles) I would like it to cry. That's all.\nSAM: You were nothing in life, and now you're nothing in death!","response":"DM: It recalls its memories. You can see its physical form become that of a young adult wearing robes that hold the symbol of the de Rolo crest. You see it look at its hands, and you see it look at you and look at Percy on the ground, unconscious, and it moans out in horror as it suddenly dissipates."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm sorry, I didn't mean it!\nTALIESIN: Which one of my ancestors did you just shame to death? Again?\nSAM: The one who possessed you!\nTALIESIN: Okay, fair.\nTALIESIN: You're going to say it, aren't you?\nLIAM: I double back to Keyleth and start trying to administer some sort of aid.\nMARISHA: Hi, I'm dead.\nLIAM: Medicine check? Is that it?","response":"DM: You can make a medicine check to try to stabilize her, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 18.","response":"DM: 18, yeah. You stabilize the bleeding. She's no longer making death saving throws. She is still unconscious. You all reconvene. Take a breath."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, is Keyleth alive?\nMARISHA: Nope.\nSAM: Oh Jesus! Keyleth, I'm sorry.\nMARISHA: I'm stabilized.\nLIAM: She needs help. Scanlan, come here.\nTALIESIN: Let's pull ourselves together.\nSAM: I will sing a song of rest, which will give us 1d8 for everybody.","response":"DM: For hit dice spent, or just for the rest?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't know. It just says 1d8. It's my song of rest.","response":"DM: Song of rest."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I've got a lot of health potions.\nMARISHA: You do?\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nMARISHA: That's good.\nTALIESIN: I've got three.\nTRAVIS: Would you like one?\nTALIESIN: Probably.\nLAURA: What if we take a short rest?","response":"DM: At the end of the short rest, everyone gains an additional 1d8. It's nice. Doesn't hurt."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's nice.\nMARISHA: What?\nTRAVIS: Hit dice?\nLAURA: Yeah, we can roll some hit dice.","response":"DM: You guys take a short rest here to roll some hit dice."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (groans) Wait, how much did you heal us, Scanlan?\nSAM: Just one extra d8. Do I roll that, or do they?","response":"DM: Everyone rolls it on their own. It's fine."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Holy ba-Jesus, guys.\nLAURA: That was insane.\nSAM: Can we never do that again?\nLAURA: Well, we're about to, I think.\nLIAM: Who feels like making camp?\nSAM: Making camp?\nLIAM: Yes.\nSAM: We're in a tomb with ghosts. We have to continue on.\nLIAM: I'm exhausted.\nTALIESIN: We'll heal, but I think we need to continue down.\nLAURA: We need to keep going.","response":"DM: Cassandra looks about the rest of you, still seeing a group of herself and her brothers. She shakes her head for a second. “We can rest a moment, but I don't think we can stay here much longer. The more time we spend here, the more chance they have of returning. If they get the jump on us, we're done.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Let's go.\nLAURA: We need to press on.\nSAM: Yeah, aye.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nSAM: Let's continue.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nSAM: Into the tunnel. Into the dark.","response":"DM: She sheathes her sword and her dagger. (sighs) “Let's do this.” As you all climb into the beginning of the excavation tunnel leading to the south, slowly making your way towards–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait! Sorry. Percival, any point in looting?\nTALIESIN: Don't loot my family's crypt!\nSAM: Sorry! Forget I mentioned it. Let's go kick some ass.","response":"DM: Making your way towards the tunnels beneath the city of Whitestone, towards whatever this ziggurat construction project has been, we will pick this up the week after Thanksgiving."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh man! We're taking a whole week off from this.","response":"DM: Yeah. We went a little late tonight to try and give a little extra since we're not going to be here next week, but that's it for the evening."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We almost got our ass kicked by ghosts!\nSAM: No, by each other.\nLAURA: We really need a cleric.","response":"DM: There were some really bad– everyone rolled poorly on those saving throws. That sucked. Oh, yes!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, man. Right. Giveaways.\nZAC: We've got to do a giveaway, so I am opening the floodgates.\nTALIESIN: Welcome, all!\nLAURA: The whole time.\nTALIESIN: This is Twitch. Holy cow.\nMARISHA: I might need to burn a Cure Wounds or something.\nTALIESIN: I'm not at a hundred, but I'm okay.\nMARISHA: I burned almost all of my hit dice to bring me back up.\nTALIESIN: Ashley is getting home right now, in case we need her.\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: We're good."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are we?\nTALIESIN: Can she come in for 30 seconds and heal us?\nTALIESIN: I know.\nMARISHA: Guys, I got a little bit of a connection! And gone. That's all.\nZAC: We also got up to $6,000 total so far, raised.\nLAURA: Oh wow, that's great!","response":"DM: Incredible!"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: So we will continue that throughout the weekend, all the way up to Monday.","response":"DM: Thank you all so much for helping out."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Holy cow.","response":"DM: You're helping a lot of wonderful people do a lot of amazing things in places that need it."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: So the floodgates are open. We're going to let that build up for a little bit and then do the giveaway.\nZAC: Oh shoot, that's true. The next episode is Critmas, as well, isn't it?\nLAURA and TALIESIN: No.\nZAC: Is there not? There's one before it?\nLAURA: No, there's another one before.\nZAC: Are you sure?\nTALIESIN: No.\nMARISHA: No, we're doing the Christmas Critmas a little bit earlier, so we're going to do the next one before we go on Christmas break, right?","response":"DM: No, the 3rd is the next Critmas. Because the 17th, our last show, is also the opening night of the new Star Wars movie, we can't go late that night because everyone's going to be gone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh. So yeah, we can't do Critmas next week.\nZAC: Next week's Thanksgiving.\nLAURA: I mean, on the 3rd.\nZAC: And we've already told everyone the first week of the month is–\nSAM: So the Christmas Critmas is going to be the 3rd.","response":"DM: It's going to be the 3rd."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: December 3rd?\nZAC: Yes.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, that will be the Crit–\nZAC: Math is hard, guys.","response":"DM: Welcome to our late-night meetings."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can't we just do it the second week? It's going to be a long episode. We'll have to cut it super short.\nMARISHA: That's what I was thinking. Can we move it to the second week?\nTALIESIN: Move it to the 10th.\nMARISHA: Christmas Critmas is going to be the 10th.\nZAC: Before we officially say that, let me check the schedule, because we've already told everyone the first week, so before we say that officially, let me check the schedule and make sure that's okay.\nLAURA: It's going to be really hard to do it on the 3rd.\nZAC: Okay.\nTALIESIN: I'm literally leaving the studio on the 17th for a road trip.\nZAC: IEShoemaker is the winner.","response":"DM: IEShoemaker, congratulations!"}
{"prompt":"ZAC: We're sending you a message right now. Send back with your address and we'll send you all sorts of great shit. Tune in tomorrow, guys, for Group Hug. Hector's bringing a couple of comedian friends of his, and they are playing all of the Jessica Jones Alias characters tomorrow, and nobody wanted to play Purple Man.","response":"DM: Understandably so."}

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's Tennant. That's also who I dressed up as at the superhero party. I painted myself purple.\nZAC: You did Purple Man? Why would you do that?!\nTALIESIN: There's an amazing photo of a friend of ours dressed as Luke Cage, just beating the shit out of me. It's amazing.\nZAC: Well, that's good.\nMARISHA: He also sang Gogol Bordello's–\nMARISHA and TALIESIN: “Start Wearing Purple.”","response":"DM: It was good."}

Guess whose playlist is next.\nTRAVIS: Oh, is it mine?\nMARISHA: You're the last one, right?\nTRAVIS: Oh, I'm the Thanksgiving playlist.\nSAM: Does the DM get a playlist?","response":"DM: I get one."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He does, but he'll go last. Because you always go last.\nMARISHA: Bye!\nSAM: Happy Thanksgiving.\nTALIESIN: Happy Thanksgiving!","response":"DM: Exactly. To get you guys up to speed: the party, Vox Machina, after having a relatively violent encounter with a couple known as the Briarwoods– Lady Delilah Briarwood and Lord Sylas Briarwood, two individuals who were responsible for essentially torturing and murdering Percy's family and taking over his town of Whitestone and for the past five years have ruled it, guiding it into some dark direction they've begun to recently unravel. The party traveled to Whitestone to clear their name as they were essentially put in a bad political position with their home town of Emon and to possibly bring vengeance for what Percy's family had undergone five years before. Upon arriving they found the town in a very dark emotional place. Zombie giants roving the streets as these controlled centurions. A number of individuals in the town feeling the general unrest. And they decided to build a revolt. Percy helming the de Rolo crest, Vox Machina went around inciting the thoughts of rebellion in the city. Not the first but apparently the one with the most chance of succeeding they've had to this date. After some infiltrations and sizable victories cutting down some of the underlings of the Briarwoods within the city, the people began to arm themselves, rise up, and fire, blade and screaming took the city as the denizens began to fight back. In this chaos, Vox Machina made their way underneath the Castle Whitestone, where the Lord and Lady Briarwood currently reside, seeking some sort of a project called the ziggurat they've been working on for a while. While they were down there they found a woman, apparently imprisoned, under an illusion that they revealed to be Anna Ripley. Dr. Anna Ripley, one of the torturers of Percy five years before and currently seemingly interested in the black powder based gun tech he had been developing. However, they took her captive, went upstairs, and discovered that Percy's sister, Cassandra, is indeed still alive and being held captive within the castle. In the process of trying to save her Anna Ripley got away, Cassandra got her throat cut but thankfully was saved by the quick actions of Vox Machina and the near death's door stepping of Vax once again. But nevertheless, saved her, prevented her disastrous fate–"}

{"prompt":"LIAM: Percival, do you know anything– Do you know what's just ahead of us?\nTALIESIN: I don't think so.","response":"DM: No, the back wall of this mausoleum was originally just a wall. There was a large 20-foot wide cavern that is chiseled through the stonework and appears to delve deeper into the ground behind them."}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, thank you!\nSAM: Did you–?\nLAURA: No, I didn't win. They were unveiling my character in Uncharted tonight.\nSAM: Did you go onstage?\nLAURA: I didn't, no. I just sat there and then I went, “Okay, well, I've got to go!” And I got up and ran and I feel like an idiot.\nTRAVIS: We got Briarwoods to kill.\nTALIESIN: Briorities.","response":"DM: Well, I'm glad you could join us. Thank you for that."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Did you say Briorities?\nTALIESIN: Briorities.\nLAURA: Briorities.","response":"DM: Taliesin!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We don't know if we have any further to go from this crypt? Uncharted?\nLAURA: That's my thing! Oh, there's no drink in my–\nLIAM: Well, go quick.\nMARISHA: Do it, it's fine. We're just starting.\nLIAM: I didn't want to touch it.\nTALIESIN: We've literally not had a conversation.\nMARISHA: We haven't done anything.\nTRAVIS: I would like to take a vial of holy oil that I have out of the Bag of Holding and keep it in my hand. Just out, so I don't have to get it out.\nMARISHA: Grog, speaking of. How many health potions do you have? I feel like we might need to redistribute.\nTRAVIS: I have a shitload. I never really use them.\nMARISHA: You should do that.\nTRAVIS: I have two level awesome– what are the biggest ones?\nSAM: Greater?","response":"DM: There's greater or superior."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I have two superior, one the top one, and five of the low ones.\nTALIESIN: Can I take two of the low ones, possibly?","response":"DM: Superior would be the highest you've received so far."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay then I have one of those.\nLIAM: I am all out of tricks, just about, so may I please have a superior, Grog?\nTRAVIS: Oh boy, does everybody want a piece of this pie?\nTRAVIS: Well, what are you offering?\nLIAM: I'm offering safety for your facial hair for perpetuity.\nTRAVIS: Nope. Give me something else.\nLIAM: Now it's in danger.\nMARISHA: How about safety for your life because we'll be having your back and whatnot?\nTRAVIS: How could you have my back if it's on me?\nMARISHA: I'm going to let that one go.\nLIAM: I will let you flick me hard, hard in the nads, should we survive.\nTRAVIS: How about you let me flick you hard in the nads now and I'll give you a healing potion?\nLIAM: Can we take a short rest after that?\nTRAVIS: Just a little one. I won't even rage or nothing. It'll just be a quick little tap on your walnut.\nLIAM: I will do this trade.\nTRAVIS: Yes! I kneel down and I get right up to his bits.\nLIAM: Wait! I pull a stick out of my bag and I put it in my mouth and I bite down very hard on it.\nSAM: I'm going to use Minor Illusion to create a bull's eye right around his crotch. Concentric circles glowing.\nTRAVIS: And like the second grader I am trying to write in cursive I have my tongue sticking out like– and I shift from using the middle finger down to the ring finger because we're being nice. And I go for– are you right-handed?\nLIAM: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: I go for the left nut. (whack)\nLIAM: (groans)\nTRAVIS: Does he throw up?","response":"DM: No, but you do take one point of damage."}

{"prompt":"LIAM: (hoarse) The good one, fucker.\nTRAVIS: I'll give you the greater. I give him a greater. And Percy. I like it when you turn into the giant cloud thing so you don't have to take a nutshot. Would you like a common or a greater?\nTALIESIN: Actually, if I could steal two commons, just to be on the safe side.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, okay. I give him two common.\nTALIESIN: I offer the satisfaction of Vax knowing that I got them for free.","response":"DM: Cassandra also steps forward and says, “I myself do not have any sort of potion of protection. Does anyone have anything which they could offer?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes, hello, hi. I look like your brother but I'm shorter.","response":"DM: Yes, that's right. By the way, everyone is currently–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Currently everybody looks–","response":"DM: Like either Percy or Cassandra, thanks to Scanlan's Seeming, which is really awkward."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (hoarse) Are we going to hold this up for when we go against the Briarwoods? I think it'll be confusing.\nSAM: Yeah, for them. You can have one of my greater healing potions. Will that suffice?","response":"DM: “Certainly, thank you.” And she comes forward and reaches out towards you and you have to reach up and put it in her hand because she's reaching out towards a much taller figure."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I look like a full-size Percy?","response":"DM: A little larger. In between."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, cool.\nTALIESIN: I throw her one of my commons as well.\nTRAVIS: I have three commons, two greaters, and one superior. I'm a walking medicine cabinet.","response":"DM: You are."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Speaking of looking like Percy and Cassandra. Vex.\nLAURA: Huh?\nSAM: That is you, right?\nLAURA: That's me, yes, what?\nSAM: Vex, if you, if you look like Cassandra, you could conceivably get in front of the Briarwoods without them knowing that it's an enemy for a moment. Maybe long enough to fire off one of your– don't you have some sort of sunbeam arrow or something?\nLAURA: I have no sunbeam arrow, but I would like to dip some arrows in some holy oil at this moment in time.\nLAURA: I do have potentially an exploding holy arrow.\nSAM: That would be pretty baller.","response":"DM: Is this the one with the question mark?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, this is a normal one, and then I have a question mark, as well.","response":"DM: Do you want to dip them both?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fuck yes, I do.\nLAURA: Yes. Well, no. Each thing takes three arrows, so I can do six arrows altogether.\nTRAVIS: Will it wear off?","response":"DM: It lasts for an hour."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are we going to get there?\nSAM: I don't know. We could fight them in five minutes.\nLAURA: I want to do it right before we walk in the room, Matt.","response":"DM: It's up to you. You can hold off."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We don't see a ziggurat yet.\nTALIESIN: Let's start making our way down there, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, but we'll have Vax scout ahead.\nSAM: Don't do anything!\nLAURA: Don't do anything. Look. Don't touch.\nTALIESIN: Vax, we've discussed our new password. Do you remember the new password?\nSAM: Which is?\nLAURA: Is there something different?\nLIAM: Is it Candyland? No, I don't remember.\nTALIESIN: It's now “Jenga, one one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand, four one-thousand, five one-thousand, six one-thousand, seven one-thousand, eight one-thousand, nine one-thousand, ten.”\nLIAM: I just got flicked in the nuts. I'm not doing that. I'll say jenga.\nLAURA: And then wait.\nLIAM: Yeah, I'll wait. So long as no more of your siblings are in danger. I did do it for reasons.\nTALIESIN: We know.\nLIAM: You know because I told you.\nTALIESIN: Yes. I consider the matter settled.\nLIAM: I don't know exactly what was going to happen, but I saw a blade against your sister's throat. I would hope you would do the same for my sister if you were to see the same thing.\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nLAURA: Of course he would.\nTALIESIN: But mostly because I fear her.\nLIAM: Scanlan, back me up. If you were to turn into some sort of three-horned beast and go running into a house full of enemies, we would give him a similar talking-to, correct?\nSAM: That would never happen. I'm more measured than all of you.\nTALIESIN: We don't actually believe that he will listen to sense.\nSAM: I'm Percy.\nTALIESIN: We just can't waste our breath, really.\nLIAM: Scanlan, shut up.\nTRAVIS: Attunement. How long does that take?","response":"DM: A short rest."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This is going to be a very complicated evening.\nTRAVIS: Should we take a short rest?\nTALIESIN: We just did.\nTRAVIS: We did?\nLAURA: Oh, we did!","response":"DM: If you wanted to attune to something during that short rest, you can."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I attune to Boots of Levitation?","response":"DM: If you'd like to, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I would like to.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We just rested for 30 minutes?","response":"DM: Roughly 30 minutes, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How would everyone feel about another seven and a half hours?\nLAURA: We can't sleep in this–\nSAM: Our meal is still active, as well. We need the benefits of that. Plus, there is a rebellion going on. It's been, what, an hour? Two hours? They're probably mostly dead by now.\nMARISHA: That's possibly very true, actually.\nTALIESIN: Cassandra?","response":"DM: “Yes?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: In your opinion, who's the more dangerous target?","response":"DM: She gets distant for a second, thinking, and haphazardly pulls the hair over her ear and rubs her armor in a nervous way. Looks over out of the side of her eyes to you and says, “They're both dangerous for different reasons. Separately, Sylas is dangerous because of his unnatural nature. I've seen him turn arguments and opposing sides into friendships in but an instant. He has some sort of power over the mind of those he looks to. That in itself is a danger, not to mention his other capabilities. I've only seen him use it twice, but that blade he carries is as dark as he is. That being said, Lady Briarwood, Delilah, she carries magic far more powerful than I've seen. She on her own was able to create, run, and rule each of these sentries that run about the entire city. She had half of the entire castle staffed with long-dead individuals. None questioned her. I've never seen her in battle, but I sense there is far more to her abilities than I've seen. The two of them together are driven– more so than the affiliation to this Whispered One they talk of, they're driven by one thing, and that's their affection for each other. As long as they are together, who knows what they're capable of.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So we split them up?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to divide and conquer this shit.\nTALIESIN: If we can.\nTRAVIS: If we can.\nMARISHA: Cassandra.","response":"DM: “Yes?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Has there been any instance where the two have separated in the recent months, that you can imagine or remember?","response":"DM: “Most of the ziggurat construction happens during the evening, when Sylas is not resting. And for the most part they journey together– for the past month, at least. No, I haven't seen them apart, really.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can you think of any reason why they would separate?","response":"DM: “Not unless something in the sun required their attention.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Something sudden that required their attention.","response":"DM: “In the sun.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: In the sun?","response":"DM: “Sylas does not appear to like being outside.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, one thing. Do we want to take the battle to them down here? Or do we want to try and lure them outside?\nLIAM: I think we would definitely prefer them outside, but what would draw them out? I do not know.\nLAURA: What if we used Seeming and made one of us seem like Lady Briarwood?\nTALIESIN: I think they would see through that.\nLAURA: Yes?\nTRAVIS: They saw through the disguise at the table back in Emon.\nSAM: Just to point this out before we go in and kill ourselves. We have evidence now. We could abandon this whole thing. Go back and fight our day in court.\nTALIESIN: I want to see what they're building down there. And I worry that it would be dangerous.\nMARISHA: Plus, we'd just abandon this entire revolution that we caused?\nLIAM: People are putting their lives on the line. Plus, Uriel is suspect now. He's been corrupted; he is not trustworthy. There's no point going back to him.\nTALIESIN: I can't leave again until this is taken care of.\nSAM: Right, that was a stupid suggestion, Keyleth.\nTRAVIS: Keyleth, come on, we've got to stay.\nSAM: We're all Seemed differently; it's very strange.\nTRAVIS: I'm really disappointed, Keyleth.\nLIAM: Cassandra, I want to say something a little frank. I'm very happy that we've found you. I'm very happy that Percival and you have been reunited. We have been burned very badly in the past by seeming allies. And I am sure you are in your right mind. But past experience has taught us to be very careful. And we are all watching you. For signs of corruption or control. I want to believe you are in control of your faculties. I do not fully trust you are and I think, just letting you know that a knife could hit your back as soon as the slightest misstep happened, is maybe enough to ensure some safety for this group.","response":"DM: “Of course. It is true I have been living here, at least in this castle with them, for the past three years. Not, not of choice, of course. And were I in your position, would think the same.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: According to Percival, they filled you with arrows. What happened?","response":"DM: “Well, I was near death. I was recovered by the father that runs the temple of Pelor and a few other individuals who had fled the city at the time. I was as far– as I was concerned, I was gone. But they nursed me back to health. Slowly. Over time. I was, for the better part, useless as an individual for about six months. And even to this day, I have a bit of a wheeze when I expend myself, but Father Reynal made sure that I was in good health. And that was when I learned truly what had become of the city in my restoration. And it was there that we began to speak of the early talks of rebellion, here in Whitestone. Me being still alive was enough of a beacon, for those who knew, for us to put together our first attempt to fight out from under their rule. And it was marked. They knew every step we took. Many lives were lost, but in that fray, they recognized me. They didn't know I was alive, either. I guess they saw the importance of keeping me under their lock and key as a way of crushing whatever hope those who still lived here had.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Why not hang you from that tree in the center of town like they did so many others?","response":"DM: “That would have certainly made a statement. There were many days when they first took me captive I would have welcomed that. But in that time we planned that first rebellion, I saw fire in the eyes of my people. Brighter than any I had witnessed in my youth. I saw their love for my family. I saw the intent of these people to take back what was theirs from this corrupt force, and I knew that I had a part to play. If they choose to leave me alive, as much as they try and sway my interests, it also brought me close to them. I watched them. I could see what they were planning. Try and gather details of this construct they're working on beneath the city and feed this information to those who I knew were still true and behind the de Rolo family name. I don't know what I can say to offer you more than that.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I don't think there's anything you can say.\nLAURA: (whispers) Can I insight check her?\nLIAM: I want you back in my friend's life, but I'm sorry, I do not trust you. And I and the others will be watching.\nLAURA: (whispers) 21.","response":"DM: 21? Okay. Looking, every word that comes out of her mouth comes with conviction, comes from a look of a person who's recalling a painful memory. There is nothing that belies any deceit."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Onward.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nLAURA: And upward.\nMARISHA: Are we going to try and separate these two? Is that the plan?\nTALIESIN: I think we're going to take the lay of the land first. See what we're up against.\nTRAVIS: Not a bad idea with Cass, but we'll see.\nTALIESIN: Vax?\nLAURA: Should I stealth with you?\nLIAM: Sure, you're very good at that now because of my gift to you.\nLAURA: Hey!\nLAURA: I get advantage because of the gold dress.\nMARISHA: The sparkles are magical.\nTALIESIN: Magic sparkles.\nLIAM: 32.\nTALIESIN: It does look like mithril, doesn't it?\nLAURA: 23.\nLAURA: Him first.\nLIAM: Me first, yeah. Her dress sparkles too much.","response":"DM: Trinket stays with the rest of the party, I assume."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, Trinket stays.\nLIAM: We're going way ahead.","response":"DM: Right, but everyone else is following behind, though."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'll be in the front. Meat shield.\nSAM: I will be right behind the meat shield.\nTALIESIN: I will be right behind the–\nLIAM: Percy number four.\nLAURA: Trinket follows Percy. He's following Percy.","response":"DM: Okay, Trinket's following Percy."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Following up the ranks with Trinket, I guess.\nLIAM: Hi, Pike.","response":"DM: And you hear for a second, call out, Pike's voice ring through the darkness, and you see before you, out of the shadow, out of the blackness that is before you in the cavern, a small gnomish hand reach out for you."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Are you all still there?\nLAURA: Pike!\nLIAM: I take her hand. I take your hand, Pike, and I kneel down, and I press the back of her hand to my forehead and hold it there for a moment.","response":"DM: As you do, the glow from the glove begins to spread from your hand across, and all of you guys see materializing out of the darkness Pike's form slowly unravel into this shadowed area into this glowing beacon of her holy form that you previously traveled with, as Pike is now once again brought to this point of clarity here beneath the castle Whitestone."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I run over and I knock Vax out of the way and I pick up Pike and give her a big hug.\nLIAM: My nut!\nTRAVIS: Oh, Pike, I'm so glad to see you!\nASHLEY: Grog, but you don't look like Grog.\nTRAVIS: What? Oh. No. (whispers) It's me.\nASHLEY: Is everybody Percy and Cassandra?\nALL: Yes.\nLAURA: Except for you, darling.","response":"DM: It's very weird. You're a tiny gnome in armor, and everyone else looks like Percy and a woman you've never seen before in your life."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Bear-Percy is especially disturbing.","response":"DM: Yeah. This giant rotund Percy on his hands and legs, just (bear noises)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That is awkward.","response":"DM: It's a very strange visual, and you're very confused momentarily."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I give Percy-Trink some ear scratches.\nLAURA: He likes it.","response":"DM: (bear noises)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I run over and I say, Pike, Pike, what happened, you disappeared before, but now you're back. Are you here to stay? What's going on?\nASHLEY: I'm here to stay for as long as I can. It's very hard to stay in this form, especially when this place is very dark, and sometimes I just get pulled away, so I'm going to stay as long as I can.\nSAM: We're so happy to have you here.\nMARISHA: So happy to have you here.\nASHLEY: I'm so happy to be here. How are you, how are you guys, are you okay, where are you at in terms of health?\nSAM: We're all healthy.\nASHLEY: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Vax is minus a hit point because I hit him in the nuts. Hah!\nSAM: And we have a new member. Well, a new traveling companion. This is Cassandra.\nTALIESIN: Cassandra de Rolo.\nLAURA: The actual Cassandra.\nASHLEY: I go over and put my hand out and hold her hand and say, it's so very nice to finally meet you.","response":"DM: She takes your hand and looks down curiously at this tiny gnome that seems to have apparated out of the shadows and gives you a curious look and a big smile creeps across her face. “It is my pleasure to have good people around me for once. Pleasure to meet you, young gnome.” Which is funny coming from her, because she's technically younger than you. She looks hardened, but she's younger than you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well. Shall we?\nTALIESIN: Now that we're together.\nLAURA: Shall we keep moving?\nTRAVIS: Now we're definitely going to kick some ass.\nSAM: With Pike with us, we can do anything.\nMARISHA: Is she glowing?","response":"DM: Pike is giving low candlelight around her, so you're going to want to keep her towards the back, probably."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Pike always ruins stealth.\nLAURA: Even when she's a ghostly form.\nSAM: Can we hang a sheet over her or something?","response":"DM: You can, it'll be like throwing a t-shirt over your bedroom light. It'll just be a nice atmospheric Chinese lantern."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh, mood lighting.","response":"DM: There you go."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I place my Sarenrae hand on her shoulder and say, you're here because she willed you to be here, she knows that we need you. Now please hide behind obese Percival. And I pat my sister on the shoulder and head back into the darkness.","response":"DM: Okay. So as Pike comes to the back, smiling at everybody, she joins the back ranks of Keyleth and Trinket. Actually, probably behind Percy. Cassandra's going to be right there. Flying V formation. And you guys continue down this tunnel."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Check for traps.\nLIAM: Yeah. Perception all that shit down.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, perception. Oh yeah, I should do it too. Hold on.\nLIAM: 20 for me.\nLAURA: Yeah, I know, right? 18 for me.\nLIAM: I lean over to my sister and say, I'm not going to do anything, I'm just going to look 50 feet down–\nLAURA: How about wait a fucking second and let me look for footprints?\nLAURA: Can I look for footprints?","response":"DM: You can. Make a survival check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. I don't know which one to use. I'm so nervous. Okay, let's do this one. That was a bad one. I'm perceptioning?","response":"DM: This is a survival."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh. Well, it's the same. That is a 16.","response":"DM: 16, okay. You get down and inspect the area. You actually pull out a small bit of torch pith and light it a bit just to get a little light across this one intersection briefly. There are footprints back and forth in all ways, but many of them have been, at least the footprints coming from, and the last footprints were coming from this tunnel to your immediate left, were from a while back. The fresher footprints, fresh as of four hours, continue on down that way. You do notice that the smell of the air itself is, you notice this as well as you're inspecting, the air down here has a very acrid, sharp scent anyway, a hint of chemical. It seems to be getting stronger to the left."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's where the acid pits are. Acid. Briarwoods. Briarwoods?\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nLIAM: Looks a little hinky?","response":"DM: It looks like it's deliberately placed, as opposed to dropped and left there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'd like to carefully approach and disarm anything I can detect or find.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and make a check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is that thieves' tools?","response":"DM: That's thieves' tools, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's a 27.","response":"DM: Okay. You find two of the large stone slabs that are part of this discarded sequence here, they have beneath them some small magical burst that is waiting to detonate. You manage to mark it and take a couple of other stone pieces to wedge underneath it to prevent it from depressing onto whatever the trigger may be, and note to the rest of the party to avoid that section."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: There's a couple of stones here that I've marked in the middle of the path. Don't step on them, please.\nTALIESIN: Copy.\nTRAVIS: Somebody tell Trinket.\nSAM: And Pike.\nLAURA: He fucking understands signs.\nMARISHA: I'll be in charge of guiding Trinket.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He listens to you.","response":"DM: The awkward large bear-Percy–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They got the message.\nMARISHA: He's still my friend. At least the bear still loves me.","response":"DM: You continue forward for another I'd say 20 minutes. Go ahead and make another perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20.\nLAURA: 21. Again.","response":"DM: Okay. Both of you guys, walking forward, both step out and look down just in time to stop your foot from pressing onto what looks to be a mound of dirt that is, once again, deliberately placed and a little more fresh than the rest of the dust-covered hallway. You can see there's an area that is distinctly a different shade of color based on the lack of dust on top of it, and you both stop just in time. Thank you very much. I got fries."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Does it take the whole passage?","response":"DM: It's right in the center, so it can be bypassed if you stick directly to the right or left and work along the sides. Trinket may be a little difficult to work on, but we'll make a roll for that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: What could possibly go wrong?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Some gas?\nLAURA: Yeah it smells like Grog, so avoid it.\nLIAM: Something bad. I'm going to stay here, I'd like you all to bring up the rear, and Kiki, bring the bear. Bring my nephew up, and I'd like everyone to pass ahead, and my sister and I will get Trinket up behind you all.\nTRAVIS: I have a question. How are we marking these traps?\nLIAM: Chalk. The last one was marked with chalk. This one I'm just standing in front of.\nTRAVIS: We're coming across a lot of these. If we need to make a quick escape, it might be a problem.\nSAM: If we're going back out the way we came in?\nTRAVIS: In a hurry.\nTALIESIN: We'll just have to remember.\nTRAVIS: Oh yeah.\nMARISHA: Hopefully, we won't be in a hurry.\nSAM: Well we'll just have Trinket run first.\nLIAM: I'm sure you've got something in that bag of yours that we can plop in front of this. For now, let's just get past it.\nLAURA: Okay, that's not good. Eight?","response":"DM: Eight? Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Plus anything?\nLAURA: Nope!\nMARISHA: That's for Trinket?\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, so who's helping Trinket?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I am. We are, I assume.\nTRAVIS: I'll help Trinket.\nTALIESIN: I'll also say, if this was a gas trap, I would probably throw my mask on before passing it, as well.\nTRAVIS: I'll help Trinket.","response":"DM: Okay, so just you, Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Just me.","response":"DM: Okay, as everyone continues pushing forward, you reach out, helping Trinket get along. Trinket's pushing up the side of the cavern, claws scraping on the side of the wall. Foot slips, slams into the mound of dirt, at which point, the mound depresses and then (explosion) bursts open into a 20 by 20-foot gas cloud."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I cast Gust of Wind really quick and push it back down the hallway?","response":"DM: You can start doing that because it is a lingering cloud effect. Regardless, I need you and Trinket to both make a constitution save."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes! 21! Nope, 20","response":"DM: Laura, can you roll a constitution save for Trinket?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17!\nLAURA: Just regular?","response":"DM: Just a regular constitution save."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Seven.","response":"DM: Seven? Okay. You suffer six points of poison damage, Trinket suffers 12 points of poison damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Grog, you suffer no poison damage. We had our meal.\nTRAVIS: Heroes' Feast!\nLAURA: And Trinket ate it, too!\nMARISHA: That's true!\nLAURA: We're immune to poison?\nMARISHA: We're immune to fear and poison.\nLAURA: (gasps) That's amazing!","response":"DM: As the cloud begins to fill the area, you breathe it in and there's that reactionary point of like, “Shit, get Trinket out of there!” and then you realize the harshness of the toxin doesn't seem to be affecting your system. There is some element of the “holy shit it's delicious” feast you guys had that is keeping the toxins at bay from entering your system."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.\nMARISHA: Also, doesn't your belt of Dwarvenkind have something like that?\nTRAVIS: Nope.\nMARISHA: No? Okay, never mind.\nLAURA: He just grows a beard. You have advantage on charisma?\nTRAVIS: I have resistance against poison damage.\nLAURA: You have advantage on persuasion checks.\nTRAVIS: I know.\nLAURA: That's awesome.","response":"DM: You take half poison damage whenever you do take poison damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, where did Pike go?\nSAM: No Pike! The evil of this place is making it hard to maintain her connection.\nMARISHA: I know it's hard. It's deep underground.\nLIAM: Oh!\nMARISHA: Hey!\nASHLEY: This astral projection is very hard to hold.\nTALIESIN: We live in an age of miracles and wonders.","response":"DM: So as you guys pass under this cloud, you–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: The connection is just not very strong.\nMARISHA: No, it's fine. I'll just leave it. It's fine.","response":"DM: Okay. It seems to be pervasive for now. It may eventually fade or sink into the earth, but it'll take a while for that to happen. But you move past this trap. You continue forward and the descent grows steadily more and more steep at this point. What was like a relative decline has now gotten to the point where some of you have to get up against the wall as you step down, not to the point where it's slide-worthy or anything, but enough where it gets a little precarious for those who don't have quite as much a grand hold on loose earth. About five minutes of this, it evens out though, and as it does you come to a metallic\ndoorway."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Of course.\nLAURA: God damn doors.\nSAM: I got this.\nTRAVIS: Please just do it.\nLAURA: Inspect it for traps!\nTRAVIS: No, let him take it!","response":"DM: Okay. The door does not appear to be trapped, but it is locked."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well.\nLAURA: Can you pick it?\nLIAM: Probably.\nTRAVIS: Metal door, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Natural 20.\nLIAM: I look back to the group and go, it won't open, it won't–\nLIAM: I don't push it that far, only like four or five inches just to peer through.","response":"DM: Okay. That same acrid smell that has permeated into the hallway continues into this room, it's a little colder; the temperature in this room is because, as you notice, looking in, what little bit of distance you can see in this pitch black vicinity, the entire room is made of this type of hammered bronze."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Before we go in, are there any bits of whitestone on the ground, like stuff in chunks or small pieces or is it pretty clean-ish?","response":"DM: As you travel through here you see chunks here and there, some of them appear to be, yeah, nothing bigger than what you can fit in your palm. Any of the larger pieces seem to have made their way all the way back to the undercroft where you guys had the ghost battle. At this point, you've just seen bits and pieces that may have fallen out of whatever carts were brought through and you do see grooves in the ground where like large wheeled carts were pushed back and forth up and down this tunnel to carry materials to and from."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I pull the door a little bit shut behind me and turn to the group and say, this is a room made entirely of metal that presumably did not exist five years ago. I think this is probably bad. Sister, dear, would you help me look? Just from the door, please? Just look.\nTRAVIS: Scanlan, just shoot a lightning bolt in there.\nLIAM: No, in a moment. Please. And perception check the room from here.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 29.\nLAURA: Oh, that's good, that's better than mine, but not much. 23?\nTRAVIS: Question mark?","response":"DM: Okay. Both glancing in what little bit of space you have to poke through, you can see the room itself, it's about 80 feet across and about 50 feet wide. From the doorway, it's a slight ramp that leads down into an open floor area, also the bronze metal, and then across the way another ramp that rises up to meet a small upper platform area. and there appears to be a door on the opposite side."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I do an arcana check, or something, to see if it's magic?","response":"DM: If you'd like to. You'd probably have to get a little closer into the room to check it out because you guys are at the outskirts of it. You're just able to see a little bit of the edge of your visual distance."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How big is the door?","response":"DM: Looking at the door, if you open it up? It's about two inches thick."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Pike, Keyleth, will you come up here? We're a little out of our depths here. This seems suspect to me. I'd like you to both have a look.\nMARISHA: Yeah, something's going on here.\nASHLEY: Yeah.\nMARISHA: So Pike and I are going up.\nASHLEY: Yeah.\nLAURA: Go. Tell us what's up.","response":"DM: Have you guys all moved up to the door, at least? Or are you all still back in the corridor?"}
{"prompt":"SAM and TALIESIN: I'm moving up to the door.\nLAURA: I'm stepping a little back.","response":"DM: Okay. Cassandra does say, “This is as far as I've gone down here.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do you know what's on the other side?","response":"DM: “I assume the project. The last time I came here, I was following the Briarwoods at a distance. They went in there with a handful of guards, and when I made it to this door, it was empty on the inside. I assume they traveled through that far door, but I have not actually been here myself. It was at that point that I was discovered and dragged back to the castle.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Did you make it to the acid pits?","response":"DM: “Back that way? I saw them, from a distance. I did not want to get too close. They're just larger, stone troughs that these chemicals have been refined in, and for whatever purpose they've required them, have been kept there. Dr. Ripley, actually, was in charge of a lot of that development and creation.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Percy and Cassandra, does this material mean anything to you? The bronze? Does it keep any type of energy out? Why build a room out of bronze?\nLIAM: That's a question for you, as well, Percival.\nTALIESIN: I don't know. I would like to get a better look. Are there markings on the walls? Is there any scripting?","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Get that out of the way. Nine?","response":"DM: Okay. As you step into the room and look along the walls at the top of the ramp that leads downward, there's no discerning features that you can glance off visually across the walls. Hammered bronze with bronze bars across to keep all the various plates that were put up together. It's not one solid piece, it's multiple sheets that were all bolted and put together to create solid walls."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And the floor is bronze?","response":"DM: The floor is bronze, as well."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The roof?","response":"DM: The roof is not bronze. The roof is what looks like solid whitestone."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That don't look good.\nLIAM: Pike, Keyleth, do you make anything of this?\nTRAVIS: Anyone want to go touch a wall?\nMARISHA: I don't even know.\nLIAM: You have no knowledge of–\nMARISHA: I'm not great with magic. I'm great with nature, and I'm not great with dungeoneering or anything like that, either. Can I do some sort of nature check to see if this is a quarry that we just walked into?\nLAURA: A conductor?\nMARISHA: A conductor, yeah. It's not really a nature thing, though.","response":"DM: Make an intelligence check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Not my forte. Oh, natural 20!\nLAURA: That's a beautiful thing.","response":"DM: Okay. This bronze-colored material, and you're not too familiar with a lot of metals, but it appears to be an alloy of some kind. It would probably be a good conductor of electricity, if utilized in a way, for whatever purpose you're unable to ascertain, but this metal is not indigenous to this region, meaning the whole area of Tal'Dorei. This metal is usually imported from distant lands. It is not found or created naturally in this area, to your knowledge."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And would I gather any information on the purpose of this room and what it's used for?","response":"DM: Not with your experience, no. Gathering about, though, as you all gather in this area and are looking around, you notice that the stonework on the ceiling has two discolorations. Across the top of the ramp above you, there is a one-inch discoloration, almost like there's a drawn line across the stone. At that height and this lack of light, can't tell if it's just a marking or an actual change in material, and there's one on the other side of the room across the way at the top of the other ramp."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's a conductor room.\nMARISHA: Oh, we're too far away to see what it's made out of?","response":"DM: At this distance and in this low light, it's hard to tell. You can see that there's a discoloration or change, but it is a consistent band across the top."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Should we send some light up there?\nLAURA: How high are the ceilings?\nTRAVIS: I have darkvision at a range of 60 feet. Can I see it?","response":"DM: What darkvision is, it's very black and white. You don't see a lot of color, and it's hard at this distance to make out anything. Without feeling it or seeing it, it's hard to get details."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I checked the door, but I didn't check anything else. Can I check the room for traps?","response":"DM: Yeah, if you'd like to."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I would like to. Rolled a 23.","response":"DM: Okay. As you descend the ramp, keeping a very close eye on the ground around you, or are you just doing a visual scan?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll walk up within a foot of the first line you referenced.","response":"DM: On the ceiling? Okay. Glancing about, you don't notice any traps. You do notice in the center of the room, the very center of the room on the floor there is a small variation in the color. You see what looks like a small almost oval-type smooth button. Or some sort of a strange object that is embedded in the floor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should I try to shoot it? When none of us are in the room?\nSAM: I would just try to– oh yeah. That's interesting.\nLIAM: That will probably tell us what this room is about. I worry a little about alerting people on the other side of the room, but it feels dangerous to go through here.\nTRAVIS: Oh man.\nLAURA: That's true.\nMARISHA: There's no vents? There's no ventilation shaft, there's nothing?\nTRAVIS: The roof is flat, or is it coned?","response":"DM: The roof is flat from what you can tell. It's a giant box, it's just the walls and the floor."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Whitestone ceiling?","response":"DM: The whitestone ceiling and the rest of it is all this bronze material with a ramp that goes down towards the bottom and the ramp that goes on the other end, with the two platforms, where you enter and where the other door across the way is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So, can we clear out and I'll try to shoot it?\nMARISHA: Sure.\nTALIESIN: See what happens.\nLAURA: Okay. I'll do that.","response":"DM: So all of you step back out into the hallway, your cluster of Percys and Cassandras."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I step one foot behind Cassandra Number Two.\nMARISHA: You've got this.\nLAURA: Do I add my attack to it?","response":"DM: Yes, you add your attack bonus."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 27.","response":"DM: 27. So you release the arrow. Perfect hit. On point. It strikes whatever this strange object is embedded in the floor. It hits and slightly ricochets and splinters as an arrow would when it hits a hard surface. No seeming reaction."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It did nothing!\nTALIESIN: I'm going to try something. First of all, does the construct of this at all remind me of anything?","response":"DM: No, actually. Most of this tunnel structure did not exist when you lived here. This has all been either re-discovered or created since you left Whitestone."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to take my sword and I'm going to go into the room and I'm going to lay my sword on the ground. Copper is a conductor. I'm having that thought. I'm going to try and slide my sword towards the center of the room and see if I can cause a short. With the piece of metal and get a positive and negative charge to hit and see if I can get a reaction.\nTALIESIN: I had a torch.","response":"DM: Yeah. You bring your torch forward and you look over. It looks like a smooth gem, like an opal or some sort of whitish opaque gem that is embedded in the ground in the center."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The Arkenstone! Definitely.\nTALIESIN: And it's not translucent? It's like an opal-like stone?","response":"DM: It's an opal-like stone, about that big that is embedded in the bronze floor. There's actually a small, metal bronze band that encases it, wraps around it that– It wasn't just pressed into it; it was put there intentionally."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I say we smash it!\nTALIESIN: I say we remove it, at the very least. See what happens.\nLAURA: Can you disarm it?\nMARISHA: All of those sound like bad ideas.\nSAM: Terrible.\nTALIESIN: Does anybody have a good idea?\nSAM: Why don't we just walk past it?\nMARISHA: I'm with Scanlan. I say we just go.\nTALIESIN: In the absence of good ideas, bad ideas, I think, are always reasonable.\nMARISHA: But maybe mine and Scanlan's is a good idea.\nLAURA: Maybe just try to get through the room. Some of us stay on one side, some other people go through and see what happens to the first person.\nLIAM: So long as you all will pick me up off the floor, I would like to skirt the entire side of the room.\nLAURA: And just go through the other door?\nLIAM: See if I can make it to the other door.\nLIAM: Please help me if I fall down. And I start along.\nTRAVIS: After a good giggle.","response":"DM: As the floor ramps down towards the center, you follow it along the wall. Making your way across, looking. You notice as you go across the wall, there are three more of these same opal stones embedded in the wall about shoulder height."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: In the wall?","response":"DM: In the wall as you go across."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is it one in the middle and then one in the center of each wall?","response":"DM: On just on your wall–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just on my wall?","response":"DM: Just on your wall, there's three along the way. There's one in the center of the room in line with the central opal, and there's two to the sides of it about four feet from each other."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I've gone into a crouch, so I'm very low, butt dragging along the floor and just sort of–","response":"DM: So you notice that. You skirt underneath."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Leaning my back against the wall.","response":"DM: Okay. They pass overhead. As you make your way underneath the three opals in this part of the wall. Making your way up the other ramp to the other side."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Continued perception check?","response":"DM: Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah. 23.","response":"DM: Okay. You make your way up this side looking about on the floor. Nothing seems to happen, nothing catches your eye. You get onto this upper platform, and there is the door there in front of you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I check for traps on the door. That is a 24.","response":"DM: The door does not appear to be trapped."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Or locked?","response":"DM: Does not appear to be locked. It does not seem to have a mechanism for opening other than if you wanted to try and push."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Go through it!\nSAM: No, let's get out of here. They wouldn't build a huge bronze trap room within their castle. No, they've lived here in peace for five years. What would they need this for? This has some sort of use for their magic. This is not a trap room.\nTRAVIS: We should try to remove one of the stones.\nMARISHA: Question. Are the stones mathematically adjacent to each other? Do they appear to be lined up?","response":"DM: Well as you can tell, there's the one in the center of the middle of the floor. Then there's one on the wall that he walked across, and as you to the other wall, there are another matching set of three on both walls."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And they're all lined up.","response":"DM: And they're all lined up. There's the two in the center of the room that match the one in the floor and then there's one to each side of that about four feet apart."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to walk in a little bit. Are there any on the ceiling?","response":"DM: Looking up. Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Natural one.","response":"DM: You get lost in the beauty of the structure."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I was going to look to see if there was one matching the one on the floor.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's good metal! Good craftsmanship, damn.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, that's good, that's a 27.","response":"DM: Looking up, no. The ceiling is just smooth whitestone. You, pushing the door– it doesn't open. It is solid stone, and as you push and look, you can see there's no hinges. Looking at where it meets the wall, it looks like it slid down into a groove. It's actually a door that would lift or sink. It slides. Some way, shape, or form, it slides into place."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Grog doesn't have an earring, does he?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I do.\nMARISHA: I think we all have earrings right now.\nLIAM: Grog?\nLAURA: He's right there! Just fucking talk to him.\nLIAM: He's across an 80-foot room! I'm not going to shout down here. There's a big heavy thing.\nTRAVIS: Yeah?\nLIAM: And you're the best you are at what you do. Do you think you could shimmy along on your tummy, along a side wall? Don't stand up because there's gems in the walls along the way and I don't know what they do, so stay low, please? And come meet me up here.\nTRAVIS: I just kinda want to walk across the room.\nLAURA: Do it.\nTRAVIS: I walk across the room.","response":"DM: Okay. So you watch in horror as Grog just strolls full, upright back, hammer in his arm with a big grin on his face. Looking like a really burly Percy. I have to keep reminding myself. It's a very curious visual every time."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I adjust my amazing spectacles.","response":"DM: Passes right through the center of where these opals are aligned across from each other. Seeming no effect. Makes his way up the ramp to where you are on the opposite side of the room."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to go get my sword.\nMARISHA: Well, hang on, while Grog goes and lifts the thing. While Grog does that, do I have any idea where we are geographically in the city, underground?","response":"DM: Keeping track best you can, you gather you're about a quarter-mile from the center of the city, from the square where the Sun Tree is. It's a quarter-mile south of you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So probably not under the Sun Tree.","response":"DM: Currently, no."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Walking up to the door, does it look like I can get any purchase with my little finger-bits?","response":"DM: Nope. It is flush with the ground."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I have a pickaxe that I picked up before we left.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I swing it at the bottom and try and find some purchase under the door?","response":"DM: You could try. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead and roll an athletics check to see if you can manage to get anything in there."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay. 16?","response":"DM: 16? Okay, so you take it and you try to get a few whacks in, it's not really getting in there. Make a strength check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Shit. Fuck. Nine?","response":"DM: Nine? You swing with the pickaxe downward for a full angry Grog-swing, and as you hit, you feel the pickaxe move further than it did before, and for a split-second your brain's like, great! And then you look down and notice that the actual handle of the pickaxe has shattered from the impact, broken in two."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're not thinking about this clearly.\nTRAVIS: Thinking?\nSAM: We've been beaten by doors before, but goddamn it, we're not going to be beaten today. I go to the center of the room and I find that little button thing and I'm going to press it.\nTALIESIN: Good.","response":"DM: Okay. You go and press your thumb down on it. It doesn't move, it doesn't shift. It doesn't give way at all, it just stays in place. As you pull your thumb away, though, you notice that the gem has a very soft, faint white glow to it, and a second after you pull your thumb away it fades back."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I walk over to the wall and touch one of the other gems.\nLAURA: I touch another one.\nMARISHA: I touch another one!","response":"DM: You guys all place your hands against the opals on the sides, and checking as you pull your hand away, the opals glow brightly white again, and then fade."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Pike.\nTRAVIS: I am Captain Planet. No.\nLAURA: Touch one of the stones, Grog.\nTRAVIS: I run over and touch a stone.\nLIAM: I touch one, too.\nSAM: I'm in the middle.\nASHLEY: I got one.\nLAURA: Trinket.\nSAM: Yeah, can Trinket touch a stone? Or Cassandra. Cassandra, make yourself useful for Christ's sake.\nLIAM: Who's Christ?\nSAM: My friend back in Gnomolia, where I'm from.","response":"DM: Pike, are you grabbing a stone or not?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: What was that?","response":"DM: Are you touching a stone or not?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yes, I am.","response":"DM: Okay. That's seven. So three on one side, three on the other, Trinket keeping there with anticipation up next to you. Pike, you put your hand on the final stone. A moment passes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is totally going to work.\nMARISHA: Come on, guys.","response":"DM: Doesn't seem to have an immediate effect."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait.\nMARISHA: No, maybe if we all think about the strength of our friendship and bond together.\nLIAM: This is our time now!\nSAM: Hold on, as much as I love Pike, you aren't a real person right now. Maybe we should swap out Pike.","response":"DM: Yeah, Pike, as you pull your hand away, the stone is glowing. And it fades momentarily after you put your hand there."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, it does work. Never mind, Pike. I love you.\nASHLEY: But are there any on the ceiling?","response":"DM: Nothing on the ceiling."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do we see any missing ones?","response":"DM: Roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 21.","response":"DM: 21. Okay. Looking about, Cassandra actually, who's up towards the far ramp, seems to notice something and walks up to where the door is, looking at the foot of the door. She moves her hand out of the way and presses her hand down on a hidden eighth opal."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice!","response":"DM: At which point there's a shift, a sound of stone shifting loudly, and those bars across the ceiling, the green bars? Let loose a bit of dust, and two large walls of green glass (impact noise) slam downward to the front and back of you, locking all seven of you into the center of this bronze room."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Where's Cassandra?","response":"DM: Cassandra's on the other side of the green wall on the far end of the room."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can we hear each other through the glass?\nLAURA: Is she on the other side of it?","response":"DM: She went up to the far platform. Which, by the way, you notice immediately, this glass, this weird, warped glass that forms these walls is the same material as the shards of green glass that you found broken on parts of the ground in the Undercroft."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Grog, can you hit it?\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Anybody have any objections?\nALL: No.\nTRAVIS: I swing away.","response":"DM: Okay. Cassandra takes a step back, go ahead\nand roll for an attack."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is the door opening behind her?","response":"DM: The door is opening, actually, behind her."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 19.","response":"DM: 19? You go ahead and you strike forward. Go\nahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 16.","response":"DM: 16. Okay. You strike with all your might across the front of the glass, Cassandra steps back as the might of it hits. A streak of green sparks fly off the edge of the blade as it careens across the front and goes (metal noises) leaving bare but a scratch across the stone. At this point, you guys see the door opening behind Cassandra, and two figures step in behind her."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Goddamn it.\nMARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast Thunderwave. Maybe this shit can only be taken down with magic.\nSAM: Wait, but are you going to hurt us?\nLAURA: I dip my arrows in holy oil. Three of them.\nMARISHA: No, it's just a push spell, but it's radiant damage thing. But you guys are behind the glass.\nTRAVIS: We're all in the glass.\nLAURA: We're all in the glass.\nTRAVIS: No, we're in a closed space.\nSAM: We're all going to get hit by what you're doing.\nMARISHA: Well, if it breaks the glass, we won't be separated by glass.\nTRAVIS: Might as well die one way or another.\nMARISHA: You wanted me to try and get us–\nLAURA: Just do it.\nLIAM: While all this is happening, I pull the vial of poison that I traded from that hag and start to drip it down onto my blade of life-stealing behind the group.","response":"DM: Okay. As you guys all gather back and up at this point, Grog, I don't know if you're still swinging?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh yeah, I'm just (angry noises).","response":"DM: As this is happening, are you preparing Thunderwave? You said you wanted to try?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do it. You said you wanted to do it, just do it.","response":"DM: With a loud sound-blast echoing through the room, you can hear the reverberation of the actual bronze material sending back the vibrations of this spell. All of you who weren't covering your ears very heartily, it still creeps through and rings your head a little bit. As the blast hits the glass, it seems to have no effect. The actual essence of the spell itself is scattered across its surface. This residuum-sealed green glass. The two figures step into what little bit of light is now visible from Percy's torch that is twisted through the warped surface of this glass wall, and you see before you Lord and Lady Briarwood stepping up to the wall, looking through, their warped visage through the glass looking down into the chamber that you're all currently locked in."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, is this your room? I didn't even realize we were in your house right now. How good to see you again, darling.","response":"DM: Sylas leans forward and puts his hand to the glass and says, “And hello to you, too. And welcome to all of you. Well, my dear.” At which point Delilah steps forward and goes, “I was hoping for a more formal reunion, but you insisted on riling up the populace and tying up the bulk of our forces. Rather unfortunate, really.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Now, the door's open behind them, right? If I use perception, do I see anything behind them, any switch or lever or anything?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20.","response":"DM: 20. Looking across the way, but barely able to peer past them with very little light in the distortion of the glass, you can see what seems to be some sort of a smooth stone placard that's embedded in the wall just on the other side of the door."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Just outside the door.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Then I pull the cape around me and I Dimension Door.\nSAM: What!\nLIAM: Outside that door, right by the placard, and jam my hand on that.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You can do that?","response":"DM: You, all of a sudden, vanish from that room, and you press your hand into that placard. You can notice, Sylas looks over his shoulder with a slight look of unexpected surprise. The smile's still across his face."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I go ahead and start conjuring Sunbeam?","response":"DM: That's if you want to. It's a spell that you do as you do it. You can't really hold it in place."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: You pressed the platform in–"}
{"prompt":"(Skype noise)\nMARISHA: No!\nTRAVIS: Keep going.","response":"DM: As you push in, there's a sound of grinding stone again. However, the walls stay in place. Two of the highest bronze plates that are pressed against the wall shift inside and move out of the way. And two big tubes push outward. Sylas looks over his shoulder and says, “Well, I was not expecting you to want to see your friends dissolved quite so quickly, but certainly.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my god, we're going to die.","response":"DM: As you guys look up, this green viscous liquid begins to pour–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I stop, I pull out the gun, and the second those hit– I've seen this coming, because fucking copper room, fucking acid. Ice shot to the one tube, do my best to reload as quickly as I can and ice shot to the other. I'm going to try and clog them with ice, at least temporarily.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and make your first shot."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 15. 27.","response":"DM: 27. Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: To hit. And that's ten plus three points of ice damage.","response":"DM: Okay. The bullet slams into the bottom of this tube, and the tube itself is not made of any real thick material; it's a similar material to the bronze the rest of this room is constructed in, and it seems like it's brought in by some sort of mechanism that locks into place. As the bullet strikes the bottom of it, it bends upward, closing off part of its passageway, and locking off the other half with ice, seemingly holding it for the time being. While you're reloading, I need you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I have advantage.","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What about these jewels?","response":"DM: The Feast gives you advantage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The Feast gives me advantage, well, but it doesn't stack, right? I rolled a 16.\nTALIESIN: It was a good thought.","response":"DM: As you pull your hand out of the switch, Sylas's gaze pierces into your eyes, and your blades, before you have a moment to notice, have already sheathed themselves, and you step into the room alongside the two of them."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The jewels! It was what lowered the glass. Break the jewels!","response":"DM: Sylas comes and pats you on the shoulder and goes, “However, it doesn't hurt to have friends. Thankfully, we were ahead of our residuum production schedule, and, well, a few minor modifications to our distillery room made an excellent trap for you.” Delilah turns to him and says, “Bit unceremonious, but I'm not in the mood to break a sweat today. We're still weeks off from being ready, and I have much work to do.” At which point, they both look over and put their hands on Cassandra. Cassandra's still standing there staring at the room with a look of coldness mixed with this brimming sense of desperation and worry. There's this crux moment in her where there's this inner conflict within her right now."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I take a swing at the jewel that I was holding my hand over?\nTALIESIN: I want to get my second.","response":"DM: Quickly, he's going to get his next shot here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Reload, second shot. 15?","response":"DM: 15. As you fire the second, it ricochets off the bronze nearby. The liquid begins to pour in now. One side is currently held, but the other half spills and begins cascading into the room."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I drink my Potion of Flying that I took from Ripley.","response":"DM: Okay, you chug a Potion of Flying, and you begin lifting off the ground. The rest of you, you do have these two ramps that push up at least five feet towards where these glass walls are, but the bottom of this entire room is beginning to fill with this liquid."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I go ahead and on my– I'm assuming I have spigots in my room? We're each in individual rooms with our own spigots?","response":"DM: No, you're all in the same room, sealed by two walls."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's why the Thunderwave hit us all, because we're all in one giant room together.\nMARISHA: Okay.\nTALIESIN: And all the gems are in our room, correct?","response":"DM: Correct, yes. All the gems except for the one that Cassandra touched."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Can I hit the fucking jewel?\nLAURA: Do it!\nSAM: Yeah, do it.\nTRAVIS: Can I try?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 18.","response":"DM: Okay. You reach down and strike the gem. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No fire damage, so 15.","response":"DM: 15, okay. You strike the gem as hard as you can, you can see it crack a little bit from the impact. The actual gem itself has a small crack run through its center. Are you guys all currently at the top of the ramps?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're backing up to where we're not in the middle of the acid.","response":"DM: Is what I'm asking, yeah. Trinket's backed up awkwardly against the back, looking really uncomfortable. Cassandra puts her hand up to the wall, and looks at the group of you and says, “Which one is my Percy?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Preparing what?\nTALIESIN: We're going to take out these gems.\nLAURA: Okay.\nTALIESIN: We're going to be fine, but we have to do it now.\nMARISHA: While they take out the gems, these earrings work telepathically, right?","response":"DM: No, you actually talk into them and it happens."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to back into the corridor while you guys handle the gems and start talking to Vax.","response":"DM: There's no corridor. You're inside."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Or the ramp, whatever.","response":"DM: Okay, you're backing up on the ramp. As you're doing that."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to be fine. Go.","response":"DM: She leans forward with her hand on the wall and looks at you in the eyes. You can see there's tears running down her face and she says, “Your sister left us the day those arrows found my chest. I did not die from those wounds but to watch you leave me there in the snow. I have a new family. I am a Briarwood. And I have a destiny with the Whispered One.” She steps back as the two Briarwoods put their arms around your sister, and even still there's a shake to her voice, and you can see in her eyes there's a quake. She speaks words of conviction, but you know deep inside, even there's conflict. At which point Delilah kisses her on the head and says, “Don't worry, my dear. It'll be over soon.” And they turn around and step into the hallway they entered from."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: One question, and I'm assuming I'm gone, but in combat, I would be able to roll a wisdom save every six seconds, right?","response":"DM: No. For this, you are technically charmed for 24 hours."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 24 hours.\nMARISHA: Can I start talking to Vax over the comms?\nTRAVIS: Can I hit the gem, please?\nLAURA: Can I Hunter's Mark them?","response":"DM: You could attempt to."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to attempt to.","response":"DM: Okay. You go to attempt Hunter's Mark and as the energy springs forth from your hand, it hits the green wall and scatters across, the arcane nature of the spell halted immediately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, figured as much.","response":"DM: Now, at this point, as you're going for the nearest gem on the wall?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, the same one I had before that cracked a little.","response":"DM: Okay. So go ahead and take another shot."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 21.\nSAM: It's one on the wall, yeah?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, same one I hit before. 15 again, no fire damage.","response":"DM: Okay. You strike the gem. This time the gem shatters. Pieces of it go flying out of the area and parts of it turn to dust and chunks hit and roll down into the acid. The acid, which now is about a foot and half, two feet high, and is slowly rising in the room."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god!\nSAM: I step into the acid.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And I start hitting the one in the center with my fucking stupid sword.\nLAURA: I shoot my exploding arrow at the glass.","response":"DM: At the glass? Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Big arrow?\nLAURA: It's an exploding arrow.","response":"DM: You guys watch Vax turn around and begin to follow the Briarwoods."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I start talking to Vax. Vax. It's Kiki. Don't forget who you are. You are stronger than this, you are stronger than them. You are not a Briarwood, you are Vox Machina, and we can't lose you. I can't lose you.\nSAM: What was that?\nMARISHA: You're our only hope. Please. You can overcome this. Please.","response":"DM: Scanlan, make an attack roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 18 plus something, I don't know how to hit things.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and roll your damage with the sword."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is that a d20? No, it says 1d8 plus three. Okay, that's not much.\nLAURA: It's something, it's something.\nTRAVIS: Can Pike do something?","response":"DM: If Pike wants to. Yeah, you guys are all together still."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Pike, do some cool shit!\nSAM: 11.\nASHLEY: I'm halfway here. This stupid astral projection is driving me nuts!","response":"DM: Oh no!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 11.","response":"DM: As you wade into the acid you feel the sting as it hits your body. You immediately take five points of acid damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I have a potion of acid resistance that I drank.","response":"DM: You did, so you take three. Three points of acid damage. And you strike down, arcing down as it splashes, parts of it go across your face. You can feel the tingle of it burn the outside of your skin, but not enough to really cause any serious damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Not the face!","response":"DM: But you strike down and you find it hit the gem and then slide off as it hits, but you feel it give a bit on the impact. Anyone else want to do anything right now?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I was going to shoot the exploding arrow at the glass door.\nLAURA: I did, and it was 22.\nLAURA: Oh shit, that would've been so good to have on them. I'm sorry.\nSAM: As my bonus action, I turn to Percy and I say, Percy, we're surrounded by metal and glass and stone above us. Is there anything we can do to that stone?\nTALIESIN: Whitestone's pretty strong.\nSAM: Can't it burn? Can't you do things with stone, Keyleth?\nTRAVIS: You have lightning. Are we going to kill ourselves if we do that?\nTALIESIN: You could stone, you could get out of this.","response":"DM: So what's the damage on that?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I know.\nMARISHA: I couldn't take Move Earth because we needed Sunbeam. I have Wall of Stone.\nSAM: What does that do?\nTRAVIS: It could buy us more time if we get on it.\nLAURA: 43.","response":"DM: 43? It hits the glass and as the explosion settles the smoke rises up and you can see a portion of the glass wall about ten feet up, shards have been chiseled out from the explosion. It's taken some damage. Not a heavy amount, but you can see there has been a portion of the wall that has been scraped away."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: About ten feet up?","response":"DM: About ten feet up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Grog!\nTRAVIS: Can I run over there? I'd have to run through the acid?","response":"DM: You would have to, yeah, unless you want to try and jump across. You could try and jump across if you want to."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes, I would like to jump across, run over, and start swinging on that section.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What side is this? On the ceiling?\nLAURA: This is on the side that they left through.\nSAM: Okay.","response":"DM: Which, the door is now closed, by the way, and Vax is nowhere in sight."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The door closed again?\nTRAVIS: Can I do great weapon master and hit it three times?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah?","response":"DM: Scanlan? Are you making another strike at the gem?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Absolutely, is it my turn again?","response":"DM: This is all fluid. We'll pull it up as you go, and you're taking your shot."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm taking three shots at one of the gems on the wall.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 17 to hit.","response":"DM: Hits, go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ten.","response":"DM: Ten. You strike down a second time, the acid now beginning to rise; the level's almost up to your chest, and it's a little harder for you to swing, but you still manage to strike true. You take four points of acid damage, but you can feel the damage itself is mounting. It's growing with each progressive amount of you that is currently submerged. You strike down, thankfully the liquid isn't too thick and you still manage to push through most of your force, your magical blade guiding it down to the gem, and you feel it (crack) beneath you. Crack and shatter."}
{"prompt":"SAM: One down.","response":"DM: One down."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We have two down.","response":"DM: Oh, sorry. Two down, between the two of you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do there appear to be any weak points in the metal anywhere?","response":"DM: Not that you can tell at a quick glance. Everything's pretty solid, and it's been used multiple times, and you see now that this room is used, and what they used to melt down all the whitestone into the residuum component during the construction of the ziggurat. Some of the notes mentioned it, Ripley mentioned a  little bit, but this– this is bad."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Acid melts whitestone?","response":"DM: It appears to, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: The whitestone on the ceiling?\nMARISHA: The acid that's filling in melts that? Okay, well, that changes things. Does my Control Water spell, would that work with the acid?","response":"DM: There's such a little water component that that spell is used to focusing on, it would be a little hard for you to do that in enough of amount to actually do any serious effect, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does the acid go through glass?\nTALIESIN: No. Glass is specifically how you contain acid.\nLAURA: Can I take one of my glass vials that I have and try to get some acid and put it up on the ceiling?","response":"DM: You can definitely fill it up, but it's a ways up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm flying.","response":"DM: Oh, yeah!"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You're flying?\nLAURA: I took a flying potion to get out of the acid.","response":"DM: So you bolt down, and it's still pouring in. The ice on the other side, by the way, shatters as it now continues to pour in from both sides, doubling the speed at which it's filling."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm taking my three shots at the next gem.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Am I high enough that I can see where the pipes are coming in at?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So I could potentially grab hold of one of the pipes on the ceiling and try to move it?","response":"DM: You could, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I want to try to grab hold of one of those pipes and aim it toward the ceiling, if I can move it.","response":"DM: Okay. We'll get to that in just a moment."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The first one was 21.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And then the second shot– dear god, it hits.\nMARISHA: He rolled an 18.\nTALIESIN: 18, 20, 30.\nTALIESIN: Third shot is 26.\nTALIESIN: That's 14.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 11 for the second shot, and 14 for the third shot.\nLAURA: I'm the weakest!\nLIAM: Not this time.\nLAURA: Do I get advantage?","response":"DM: Not for this, you don't."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Damn it.\nMARISHA: Can I help her out?\nLAURA: Get those Boots of Levitation. Get them on! Fly up, because I just rolled a fucking zero. Literally a zero.","response":"DM: You grab it, and as you're holding onto it, it's pliable. It's not a very hard metal, but you just don't have the strength, physically, in this one attempt to bend it in any way, shape, or form."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I use my dagger that I have?\nMARISHA: Hold on. Use your dagger, and seeing what she's doing, I'm going to cast my Heat Metal spell on it, and start heating and melting it.\nLAURA: The pipe?\nMARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: So you reach over and cast Heat Metal. The pipe section sticks out about two and a half feet from this point, so you can grasp it there. You look over and see the metal itself beginning to heat up, beginning to glow."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I try to lift it?","response":"DM: You can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I wrap my hands in cloth, and then I do it.","response":"DM: Okay, so you take your cloak and wrap it up. Good call. What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I say to everybody, when Cassandra put her hand on the hidden gem outside the glass, it closed the doors, right?\nLAURA: Yeah.\nSAM: If I put my hands on that while you're putting your hands on the inside gems, it might open the doors, right?\nLAURA: Potentially, but we destroyed them.\nMARISHA: We destroyed two.\nSAM: Yeah, but maybe if we do the other ones, it would still work? Is it worth a shot?\nLAURA: Can you Dimension Door?\nSAM: I could.\nTRAVIS: Can you take some people with you?\nSAM: No. I can take Pike.\nLAURA: Take Pike.","response":"DM: You can take one person."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Of my height.","response":"DM: Of your size. Medium creatures."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, my size, not my height?","response":"DM: Well, you are, as a gnome, a small creature, aren't you?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But he's Percy-sized right now.","response":"DM: Pretty sure."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well, it's fake, though.\nLAURA: Oh, right.","response":"DM: Let me double-check this real fast. Yeah, a gnome's considered small, so it would have to be a small creature, for you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can take Pike.\nLAURA: Do it!\nSAM: Wait, no.\nLAURA: Just try it.\nSAM: There's four of us in here, and four gems left.\nMARISHA: How many gems are left inside?\nTALIESIN: Four. But it could be that that's the only gem that's necessary.\nSAM: Or I could go outside the stone door and see if there's any more buttons out there to press.\nMARISHA: I think going outside is a good idea. Go outside.","response":"DM: Grog, do you want to make your strikes?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Pike, shall I take you with me?\nASHLEY: Yes, let's go!\nLAURA: Go.\nSAM: The best thing I've ever heard. You and me in a room alone together.\nTRAVIS: 13, 17, and 13.","response":"DM: First two hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, it was 15, 20, and 23 on the hits. That was the damage.","response":"DM: That was for the damage? Oh, got you. So as you slam into it and slam into it, with each progressive hit, you can see the glass itself is gliding off the blade. You're doing bits of damage, but it's going to take you a while. You could get through this in about ten minutes, but right now the acid has lifted to the point where the next round, everyone's going to start being submerged."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I take Pike by the hands and I will Dimension Door out through the glass to where she put her hand on the hidden gem. Is that right?","response":"DM: Okay. You step out of the acid. It's dripping off the lower half of your body. This sizzling smoke is pouring off your body."}
{"prompt":"SAM: My leather pants are singed!","response":"DM: Don't Lenny Kravitz this. You walk up the ramp, you grab Pike, and the two of you appear on the other side of the glass door, up on the platform where Cassandra pressed the final gem."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Pike, now's a good time to talk about us, don't you think? No, I'll just put my hand on the gem.\nASHLEY: Scanlan, not now!\nSAM: Okay!","response":"DM: You put your hand on the gem, and put your hand away for a second and see the gem itself is glowing, but does not seem to be–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Try to put your hands on the other non-destroyed gems!","response":"DM: Make another strength check now, with the Heat Metal."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: I'm running over to the other gems.\nMARISHA: Come on, Vex.\nLAURA: That's way better! 13?","response":"DM: 13? Okay, with the help of the Heat Metal, which managed to make the metal more pliable, you do still take three points of fire damage because the metal itself is burning, and you're putting your weight against it and pushing against the edge of the wall, but you pull it up, and it begins arcing upward, and you push it over in the direction of the wall where he is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, at the ceiling.","response":"DM: Yeah. There is force just pushing it outward. As it arcs over, it starts splattering across the whitestone on the ceiling. As it hits, the whitestone dissolves and you can see it's causing these huge pockmarks in the actual stone above the glass."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do that more.\nLAURA: I keep doing it.\nMARISHA: I'm going to switch my Heat Metal spell over to the other spigot.\nLAURA: And I fly over to the other side and do the same thing.","response":"DM: Okay. It's not hitting the whole ceiling. You could probably take another round to keep directing it, if you want to. It's up to you. You could either keep directing this one, because right now it's just starting to hit the ceiling."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'll keep directing it.","response":"DM: Okay. Moving it over there. What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm running over to the gem.\nSAM: Put your hands on the gems!\nTALIESIN: I'm running over to a gem.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys make your attacks on separate gems."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, we're going to put our hands on the gem, right?","response":"DM: You're putting hands on it?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to hands-on and see if anything happens, and if nothing does, I'm going to pull out my sword and start whacking it.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys run up and put your hands on the gems."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can they get two gems each?","response":"DM: They've both gotten two gems each, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And my hand is on–","response":"DM: On the bottom gem."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Come on, work, damn it.","response":"DM: You could, yeah. You could probably get one gem. There's only four gems left."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Could Trinket do the other one? Where's Trinket?","response":"DM: Trinket is up against the wall on the sides, very scared right now."}
{"prompt":"SAM and TALIESIN: We need a fourth hand!\nMARISHA: Oh, okay! Still keeping my Heat Metal spell up.","response":"DM: You place all of your hands on the gems? No apparent effect."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fuck!\nTALIESIN: I pull out my sword and start whacking it.\nTRAVIS: Fuck you, gem!","response":"DM: Make another strength check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Shitballs. We're going to die.\nLIAM: Guys, the Briarwoods' personal quarters are really plush. They're sick.","response":"DM: You rolled zero again?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, I'm out!","response":"DM: I forgot, you're outside. You're fine. Pike, you don't, because you and Scanlan are outside of the room."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And I'm resistant.","response":"DM: Yeah, so you take two."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Pike, my love. Is there any way you can get to the other side of this stone wall to see what's over there?\nTALIESIN: Break your gem!\nSAM: Break my gem?\nTALIESIN: The outside gem. Break the outside gem!","response":"DM: You hear Percy yelling from the other side."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: (shouting) Break the outside gem!\nSAM: All I hear is, (muffled noises).\nTALIESIN: (muffled) Just fucking break the gem!\nLAURA: Break the outside gem!\nSAM: I think Percy wants us to kiss, Pike.\nTALIESIN: (muffled) Kiss?! No, I just want you to break the goddamn thing!\nSAM: He said the power of love will inspire him?\nTALIESIN: (muffled) Fuck the power of love!\nASHLEY: I take my hand and I Guiding Bolt the top of the gem.","response":"DM: Okay. Roll a spell attack– or for Guiding Bolt is it a saving throw?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: One more time? Sorry, I can't hear you very well.","response":"DM: I can't remember if it's a saving throw or not for Guiding Bolt. Let me check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Maybe you could hit it with a mace, Pike.","response":"DM: Guiding Bolt– yeah, make a ranged spell attack. With advantage, because it's right in front of your hand."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: So roll two d20s, take the higher of the two, and add your spell attack modifier."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Cold as ice, Mercer.\nTRAVIS: We're hitting gems, too.\nASHLEY: 16.\nSAM: What did you say, Ashley?\nASHLEY: 16.\nSAM: She said 16.","response":"DM: 16. Yeah, that's easy enough. Roll your damage for your Guiding Bolt. It's 4d6 radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 4d6.\nASHLEY: Okay.\nTALIESIN: I'm hitting my gem, too.","response":"DM: Okay. Roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm trying really hard to lift this pipe with my scrawny little arms.","response":"DM: Make another strength check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17.\nLAURA: Oh no.","response":"DM: (glass breaking noise) Your gem shatters."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I rolled a 30 to hit.","response":"DM: Yeah, that hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 12 for strength.","response":"DM: 12 for strength? You manage to move it to the side. You take two points of fire damage as the heat from the actual metal itself is starting to push through the leather, and you can feel it burning the edge of your skin."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: But you do arc it over a little further, and it's now (splatter noise) pouring onto the ceiling and splashing over and down over the glass wall. You can see, the stonework is melting through and after a few seconds of this, you begin to see the top of where the glass wall ends."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Get over it!","response":"DM: As the wall dissipates and the acid begins to push through the rest of the whitestone, you guys look up and you can see the ceiling above you begin to turn dark for a second before part begins to (dripping noises) drip acid into the small chamber that the two of you currently are standing in."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Total of 20.","response":"DM: Total of 20 damage? Yeah, the gem on the ground before you (glass breaking noise) shatters with a blast of radiant energy."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And does the stone door behind us open?","response":"DM: You still have one more gem left. It's the one you were touching."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! We have another gem. Hit it!\nMARISHA: The one I was touching?","response":"DM: What are you doing, Keyleth?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to put my hand on it and do–\nSAM: Squeeze Gem.\nMARISHA: I'm going to do another Thunderwave. Bam! See if I can Thunderwave crack it.\nTALIESIN: These things are really easy to kill.\nLAURA: Yeah, that's a lot of energy.","response":"DM: Roll damage on the Thunderwave."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: They get killed by not a lot, or a lot?\nTALIESIN: They get killed by hitting them with your fist.\nTRAVIS: Or your staff.\nMARISHA: 11 points of damage.","response":"DM: 11 points of damage? Okay. Thunderwave (explosion noise) resounds off, and you see the gem crack in place, but it's still held in its current position in the wall."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hit it!\nLAURA: Hit it with your staff!","response":"DM: At this point in time, as you guys finish this, the ceiling begins to open into a tunnel above you, and acid begins to fill the room that both of you guys are in."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Me and Pike?","response":"DM: Yeah, both of you guys."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Did I finish killing my gem?","response":"DM: You did, yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take a shot, if I have anything else to do. Can I take a shot at the gem that she just cracked?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does it look like a big enough tunnel now that I can move the pipe?","response":"DM: Right now, a person could climb through over top of the green wall."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A goliath?\nLAURA: And a bear?","response":"DM: At this point, the way you've been leaning over and it is slopping over, you could probably squeeze them through. A bear, you'd have to push Winnie the Pooh-style, but it's doable."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 18?","response":"DM: 18 hits, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 16 points of damage.","response":"DM: (shattering noise) The last gem shatters from the blast of the gun. Pieces of the opal scatter across your face, Keyleth. Not enough to cut you. At which point, the green stone wall behind you, (scraping noise) lifts up, revealing the room behind you. The one in front of you tries to lift up, and is caught because currently, part of the stone that lifts it up has been dissolved."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Dimension Door out, again!\nSAM: Three points? Mine's halved, right, so it's two?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, out of frustration, I see this, can I do a wall of stone from underneath the glass to try and lift it up?","response":"DM: Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your wisdom check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Not great. Oh! I get advantage on wisdom, right?","response":"DM: It's not a wisdom save."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fucking shit. Balls. Wisdom. Just wisdom?","response":"DM: Just wisdom."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Eight.","response":"DM: Eight? You use your Wall of Stone spell. You feel there is the stone surface beneath the bronze. You can sense, as the stone begins to push up from the whitestone beneath the bronze plates, and it (impact noise) hits, and it's not strong enough to force its way through. Both the bronze plating, and the wall itself."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Bye, 5th-level spell.\nTRAVIS: Can we lower a rope and get over the glass now that there's a little space?\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Roll a strength check to try to bend it away, if you want to."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I've still got that Heat Metal up.\nLAURA: Nine.","response":"DM: With the Heat Metal?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's still up. It's a concentration spell, yeah.","response":"DM: You start moving it away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I kick it with my foot to move it out of the way.","response":"DM: You're pushing as hard as you can. It's shifting, but it's going to take you another round to move it over. Pike and Scanlan–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm like Chun Lee, my legs are so strong.","response":"DM: You are, technically. That's only one point of acid damage to both of you because these d6 are rolling crap. But this is the second round because it's filling up, so it's two of those. And I rolled a one! So two points of acid, but you take one because you're halved. So two points of acid damage to you, Pike. You're now up to about waist high in this acid that's beginning to burn through and dissolve. Who's doing what now? Anything? Anyone else, or are you just waiting on these guys to finish with their actions?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Should I get out of here and try to start working on the stone?\nLAURA: Go on the other side so you can open up the door that leads out.\nTALIESIN: Wait, I'm so sorry, how far out is the acid room from where we are right now?","response":"DM: You mean the room they're in?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, the room that the acid is stored in.","response":"DM: You don't know, actually. Oh, you mean the one that was way back?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: That was quite a ways away."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, damn it. Okay.","response":"DM: It's probably a mile behind you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Pike, is there any way you can get through this stone wall to the other side to see what's there?\nLAURA: Oh, yeah! You're made of jelly. Can you do it?\nSAM: Oh no, we can't hear you.","response":"DM: Hold on, we can't hear you."}
{"prompt":"SAM: The darkness is consuming her.\nLIAM: Oh no, she's muted. Hanging up and calling you back.","response":"DM: Roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Who, me?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I am having some fabulous dark chocolate right now. It is so good. They're feeding it to me.","response":"DM: Can we hear you, Ashley? There we go."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Four.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: Pike, roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. Sorry, guys! I don't know what's going on.\nSAM: It's the evil.\nASHLEY: I know, it's the evil! It's so strong! I rolled a 19.","response":"DM: Okay. As the acid's pouring and you're looking about, you notice that the acid level raised to a certain point, and doesn't seem to be continuing. Actually, glancing over, you see the door that the Briarwoods left out of, behind you, is made of whitestone, and the acid that has filled this chamber, which is usually sealed off by the glass wall that has now spilled over through the ceiling, has actually dissolved through the bottom of the door. At this time, it's begun to subside, almost like the liquid that's coming through is not keeping up with the amount that is pouring into the hallway behind you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's awesome.\nASHLEY: Good news, guys! We're not going to drown.","response":"DM: Laura, make another strength check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. This is the best. Oh, four.","response":"DM: Okay. You just can't move it. At this point, the Heat Metal has burned your arms enough to the point where you're finding a hard time managing to keep your muscles together to move it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's made of metal, guys.","response":"DM: The doorway that's right there, about waist-high to you, has completely dissolved on the bottom."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, so we can swim through?","response":"DM: If you want to try, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to do that. I'm going to take a snorkel.","response":"DM: Okay. In doing so, Scanlan, you take eight points of acid damage, reduced to four because of your resistance. You go through and pop out on the other side in the hallway. It's a stone hallway, and the acid is currently dissolving the ground below, and it's sinking into the ground, China Syndrome-style."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are there any buttons, knobs, levers?","response":"DM: Looking up, you do see immediately to your right in the hallway, there is a stone square with a push plate."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Motherfucker.\nLAURA: That's what he pushed. Push it!\nSAM: Did I see Vax push that?","response":"DM: You saw Vax appear behind them and push something in that direction."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, so I will push that.","response":"DM: Okay, you push it. As it clicks inward, you hear the grinding of gears and stone, and all of a sudden the tube that you're holding shudders for a second. The fluid begins to stop spewing forth. The rest of it begins to glide out, eventually coming to a stop as the acid stops pouring into the room. The door that you swam under lifts up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Guess I could have done that before. Sorry. I wanted to wait until they were gone. That's what it was. I was waiting until they were gone.","response":"DM: At this point in time, you see where the opals were on the sides, the portions that keep them housed? Slowly move into the wall, leaving these holes behind them, and the one in the ground depresses and disappears. As it does, the acid that's in the room begins to slowly drain out."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes.\nMARISHA: Scanlan, what do you see on the other side of where you are?\nSAM: I see stone, acid, a very handsome gnome– oh wait, that's me. And a big button that I just pressed.\nTALIESIN: We can see you now, can't we?\nSAM: Oh, hi. See you guys, you look green.\nLAURA: Unless it's still blocking the way because the door won't open, so we have to go up and over the fucking door. So that's what we have to do.\nTRAVIS: Up and over the wall?\nLAURA: The glass door that is partially destroyed that won't lower.\nMARISHA: We can't open the door.\nSAM: None, no more buttons or levers out there? Nothing else?","response":"DM: Not currently. You guys smashed everything that was in the vicinity."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We jammed the door. It won't open. So. There's a tunnel; we can go up and over.\nTALIESIN: We have a rope.\nMARISHA: Throw a rope over to get over.","response":"DM: You wait a few moments for the level to descend a little bit to the point where you can stand comfortably without taking any acid damage. As it drains over, there is that portion of ceiling now where it's pockmarked and destroyed, close to where the glass wall hits the ceiling–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I use the earring and I go, Vax! Vax, please! That acid is filling the room! We're all dying. I don't know what to do.","response":"DM: As you're walking alongside the Briarwoods into a new chamber, you hear the words hit your ear and you can feel the back of your throat choking up as a part of you is urging you to run back. And as you stop instinctively in your step, the rest of the group walks ahead about ten feet before Sylas looks over his shoulder and says, “Keep up, please. There's work to be done.” At which point, you feel yourself just continue stepping forward and catching up to him, because you wouldn't want to make Sylas angry."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Purple Man.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I was just going to say. Fucking fuck you, David Tennant.\nTRAVIS: We've got to get out of this room.\nLAURA: Yeah. Up and over, let's go.\nTALIESIN and MARISHA: Rope.\nLAURA: I have the robe of infinite rope-ness.","response":"DM: Okay, so you take a few times. You want to just throw the rope over? You could, however you want to get the rope up and over the area, it takes a few tries but you get it on the other side."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm flying.","response":"DM: Oh yeah, you're flying, you just drop it over. It's fine. We'll say for the sake of brevity, a few minutes pass. You guys manage to get each one of you over, Trinket being the hardest point."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I tie him and then Grog lifts him like a pulley.\nTALIESIN: Very uncomfortable for everyone involved.","response":"DM: Which, when Trinket reaches the top, it's like trying to fit an oblong object through a hole."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm flying so I get underneath him and try and wedge him, help him get into the hole.","response":"DM: We'll say it takes an additional ten minutes, but you manage to finally get Trinket through."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, I have a rumbly in my tumbly.","response":"DM: That was straight-up Winnie the Pooh. I'm really happy about that. On the other side of the now pretty much ruined acid distillery, the residuum factory that was constructed here by the Briarwoods, you can see in the tunnel before you that most of the stone before you has dissolved, and there's certain levels of eroded stonework that descends about 30 feet before rockily climbing back up to the original height it was. It can be traversed, climbed with mild difficulty, but you gather yourselves to continue pushing forward and to both complete this journey and to retrieve your ally who is now currently under the gaze of your enemy. And with that, we're going to take a quick bathroom break. Quick break. Want to get back into this."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We'll be right back, Ashley.","response":"DM: See you guys in a second."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Oh!\nTRAVIS: Oh. My. God.\nMARISHA: Wait, that was on that empty barrel?\nASHLEY: What?\nLAURA: Oh my god. I thought–\nMARISHA: He didn't know who it was for.\nLAURA: Oh my god.\nSAM: Wow.\nTRAVIS: Does any of us see this besides him?","response":"DM: You guys all come up to the top, you look down and you see Percy still down, looking at his gun in a wide-eyed, spacey expression on his face."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Percival?\nTALIESIN: No. No, I'm not.\nSAM: Is your bangy thing okay? Is it your sister?\nTALIESIN: We'll see what this means.\nMARISHA: Oh, Percy.\nTALIESIN: Let's go take care of this.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Let's. But you always have a choice.\nTALIESIN: We'll see.","response":"DM: You climb up and out, you guys make your way down this tunnel, no more than 60 feet from where you are, before the chamber opens up before you into what is a large underground cavern. Mostly cleared out, it looks like portions of it are, you know, both the tunnel and this area–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we stealth?","response":"DM: You can if you'd like."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think we should, because as far as they know, we're dead now. They don't know we got out of there.\nMARISHA: It's true.","response":"DM: Okay. So everyone go ahead and roll stealth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh my god.\nLAURA: Yeah, I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us.\nMARISHA: I still critical failed.\nLAURA: Wait, can't you roll again now that I told you we were casting–\nLAURA: Doesn't work that way?\nTRAVIS: 26.","response":"DM: 26. Vex?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 16.\nLAURA: Nice. 35.\nSAM: 27.\nTALIESIN: 24.","response":"DM: Okay. As a median, the group does really well, so that helps overtake for your misstep."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: God, it's cold in here! Jesus.","response":"DM: Looking around, you can see the boards and pieces of wood and stone that are keeping this hallway up, and as you step into this large chamber, it's dark and mostly freshly carved earth. Elements of earth have been taken out, and you can see to the right and left of you as you enter this chamber there are more and more chunks of that broken stone and large piles of moved earth that are in some levels of being left there or going to be moved out, or eventually were put to a point where it was no longer necessary to have to clear the area. You do see, on the sides of you, there are these iron carts, wheeled carts that have handles on them. Some have means of being pulled along separately. These carts were used, you can gather, for moving a lot of the materials back and forth. It's probably what the ramps in the previous rooms were also to collect. You can see there's a residuum dust coating on a lot of these carts, as well as broken pieces of whitestone."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The broken pieces of whitestone, are there any that are the size of two hands?","response":"DM: There's a few you could probably grab, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I grab a big, two-handed piece and put it in the Bag of Holding?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I take some of it and rub it on some of my arrows?","response":"DM: Okay. Sure. You rub it on. Most of it falls off, as it's metallic arrow point to dust, but some of it does manage to stay on for the time being. Your holy oil is still active, those that you dipped your arrows in. However, as you look past the darkness, you can see in the center of this room a monolithic structure not unlike a large pyramid-type platformed element, and immediately upon looking at it, you can see this has to be the ziggurat that everyone's been talking about in Whitestone. You can see that the base of it is white, and is very much the same texture and color as all of the whitestone you've seen used in the construction and all of the mining materials here within the city, but from what little light you have in the room– and there is a little bit of ambient light from torches set at different points, and those who can see decently at a distance, and there is an ominous glow to the structure itself– it gradually turns to a greenish color. Hard to see exactly why this transition is, but it goes from white to a green towards the top, and it levels off. You can see what looks to be a small separate structure at the very top. There are long stairways that are visible on the two sides you can see before you: long stairways. Everyone make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm scared of all of my dice right now.\nMARISHA: Yeah, mine are failing me.\nSAM: One.\nMARISHA: Fucking shit.\nLAURA: 18.\nASHLEY: 14.\nTRAVIS: Ten.\nTALIESIN: 24.\nMARISHA: 16.","response":"DM: Okay. Vex and Percy: as you begin to step out along the wall, and as you guys are moving towards the ziggurat, you can see through the darkness, there is a bit of low light along the edge of the pyramid, and you can see, halfway up the staircase, four individuals stepping up the stairs at a distance."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is this Egyptian pyramid-sized big?","response":"DM: It's more Aztec. It's not quite gargantuan."}
{"prompt":"SAM: There's 200 stairs?","response":"DM: Approximately. I'd say the whole structure from bottom to high is maybe 200 feet tall. It's not extremely large."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What's the roof look like above it?","response":"DM: It's hard to see at this distance, especially with the very little light here. You can tell just enough, though, that there is some sort of roof, but you can't make any details out from this distance."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do I have any geographical idea of where we are in the city? Is this located under the Sun Tree?","response":"DM: This would be pretty close to where the Sun Tree is located, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Before we go stomping in there, should we take a short rest and heal up? Is anyone besides me and Pike damaged at all?\nLAURA: I'm damaged a little.\nMARISHA: I'm damaged, but–\nLAURA: I don't know how long I want to wait when Vax is–\nSAM: We don't want to start traipsing up. They'll see us coming.\nTRAVIS: Is there cover? Can they see us if we can see them?","response":"DM: Where you're currently standing, there's very little to no light. If you're careful, you could possibly slip by their detection."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Or we could wait until they get up there and then go.\nTALIESIN: Except what happens when they get up there?\nLIAM: Quick question: while I'm with my new friends, in any moments that they're not telling me to go somewhere or walk somewhere, can I just look at the symbol on my hand?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's it. Just stare at it whenever I can, when they're not paying attention.","response":"DM: Okay. You glance at it. It doesn't seem to have any particular glow or connection. Especially since Pike made her arrival, it seems to be the energy of connection that was briefly housed in that symbol by her has transitioned to her form here."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Will anybody gain something back from a short rest that we really need, or do we need to go after them?\nMARISHA: I'm afraid they're marching him to his death.\nLAURA: To sacrifice him.\nTRAVIS: What about you?\nSAM: I'd gain a few hit points, but it's nothing bad. I can take a potion.\nMARISHA: We'll have to heal in battle, if we need to.\nASHLEY: I can do a healing spell, you know.\nSAM: Thanks, Sarah Palin.","response":"DM: If you'd like to."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Where's everybody at?\nLAURA: That Vasselheim accent is rubbing off on you, Pike.","response":"DM: Who's looking hurt?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Are you guys all pretty low?\nSAM: Not really.\nLAURA: I think save your spells, Pike.\nMARISHA: What's the plan?\nTRAVIS: Let's go.\nLAURA: I don't know. Stealth as much as we can and then take them out? I don't know.\nTRAVIS: We're at the bottom of this pyramid. They're walking up to the top.","response":"DM: At this time, they're close to the top."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's start making our way.","response":"DM: It's just stairs. Pretty steep stairs, but stairs nonetheless."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're going to have to Ghostbusters this.\nLAURA: How high up can I fly? Is it all dark up?","response":"DM: It is. There's a very little bit of light that's part of the ziggurat itself."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I keep raising up.\nTRAVIS: Four sides to the pyramid?","response":"DM: Four sides. You can only see two."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I want to keep raising up so I can get a better view of what's happening.\nMARISHA: I tell Pike real quick, Pike, we are right under the Sun Tree, which was dedicated to the god Pelor. This tree might end up being our best friend in this fight. Keep that in mind going forward.\nLAURA: Are Sarenrae and Pelor good buddies?\nMARISHA: Yeah, are they on good terms?\nASHLEY: Well, let's hope so.\nLAURA: Would you know?","response":"DM: You would know that Sarenrae and Pelor are adjacent deities in this realm. They have many overlapping interests and both strive to light, to healing– many spheres of overlap in those regards, so yes."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Now that I'm thinking about it, I think they are pretty good friends.\nSAM: How far away are the four figures from us right now?","response":"DM: Oh, man. They're probably a good 500 to 600 feet from you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Should we flank and go?\nSAM: Do you want to just hit them hard?\nLAURA: Or should we get on each side?\nMARISHA: How many feet? 50 to 60 feet?\nSAM: 600.","response":"DM: They're at the top of the ziggurat now. Actually, at this time, they're just now cresting over and vanishing over the lip."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: From the base of the pyramid, what would you say the base circumference of this ziggurat is? Is it half a mile around?","response":"DM: No, it's smaller than that. I'd say it's about–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 200 feet square? One on each side?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, should we come up on different sides?\nLAURA: Percy, what do you think?\nMARISHA and TALIESIN: Flank them.\nSAM: They're going to be inside, though, before we get halfway up.\nTALIESIN: There's no inside. It's just on top.\nTRAVIS: We don't know what's up there.\nLAURA: Can I see? I raised up.","response":"DM: You raised up and you look–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's for grain storage.","response":"DM: What little source of light you can see, where the stairs stop, there's a level platform, there's some pillars, and there appears to be a secondary structure, a deep green, almost dark jade-type structure that is built. A square structure right there at the very top."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Probably out of the same glass bullshit.\nLAURA: Vax will hear me if I whisper down to everybody.\nTRAVIS: Oh, fuck. That's right.\nMARISHA: See if he can stall. Tell him to stall.\nLAURA: (whispering) Vax. Vax!","response":"DM: You can still respond, if you wish. You still have your mind about you; you just consider the Briarwoods right now your closest allies, and they have to be protected."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Where are you?\nSAM: No. Stop it.\nLAURA: (whispering) I don't know where we are. Acid everywhere. Vax, please. Isn't there anything you can do?\nLIAM: We should all be together. You should join me here.\nLAURA: (whispering) I would love to, but I don't know where you are.\nLIAM: I'm on the top of a thing. I can see very far. Everybody is very attractive up here. I think something nice is about to happen. I'm afraid to ask questions, though; I don't want to seem–","response":"DM: “Who are you talking to, lovely boy?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) Please, Vax. Please.\nLIAM: To Sarenrae.","response":"DM: Make a wisdom check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: With no advantage? I'm still a half-elf.","response":"DM: I know."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Isn't he supposed to not be able to get charmed?\nLIAM: 13. No, I have advantage.\nTALIESIN: Feast.","response":"DM: This isn't a saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Advantage for half-elf, advantage for feast.","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Total of 13.","response":"DM: 13? Okay. You continue with the deception. You pushed through enough to guard the answer, as opposed to spilling the truth to your ally. She gives a, “That's not very welcome here. I would not recommend that. Put it away.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What is that?","response":"DM: “Put it away. That's not welcome here.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes. You're still very pretty.","response":"DM: “I'm taken, my darling.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm stalling so that everyone can walk around.\nLIAM: Me too.\nTALIESIN: I'm starting to make my way up.\nMARISHA: We're flanking on the far side.\nASHLEY: Can I go up to Vax and–\nLAURA: Oh, he's not here!","response":"DM: Vax isn't with you guys. Vax is with the Briarwoods at the top of the ziggurat."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Earring talk.\nASHLEY: Shit. Okay, sorry. That must have been when I got disconnected. I know what's going on now.","response":"DM: So while they're having this discussion, you guys begin to ascend the steps as a group?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: There are four sides. Who wants to come on my side?\nSAM: Me and Pike.\nTRAVIS: Okay.\nMARISHA: I'll go with Grog.\nLAURA: Wait.\nTALIESIN: And you can join me.\nLAURA: I'm flying up.\nTALIESIN: So I'm just walking up the center.\nLAURA: Trinket's going–\nTALIESIN: With me.\nLAURA: Sure.\nTALIESIN: Trinket's with me.\nMARISHA: Guys, thought for a second: what if Percy goes as a distraction? Percy goes first.\nSAM: We all look like Percy.\nMARISHA: But they might be able to see through that. Use Percy as bait while the rest of us go up.\nLAURA: Vax looks like Percy right now! They know we're up to something.\nMARISHA: That's why I said send in the real Percy.\nLAURA: Send in the real Percy?","response":"DM: So, how many groups are you breaking into?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Three.","response":"DM: Three groups. Okay. Gnomes in one, Percy and Trinket in one, Grog and who else?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Keyleth.","response":"DM: Keyleth, and you're floating above somewhere."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm floating above, keeping an eye.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: My heart is pounding.","response":"DM: As you all separate, the closest stairway to you, you would probably get there sooner. Who's taking that stairway?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: The gnomes. We're slow.\nLAURA: And I'm sneaking into the dark as much as I can, but I want to raise up and be where I can be above them and shoot down.\nTRAVIS: Sure.","response":"DM: Okay, we'll say you're on this side."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Maybe we should split the party further.","response":"DM: You could. It's not a bad idea."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is so brilliant.\nMARISHA: We've got this.\nLAURA: Oh god.","response":"DM: As you begin to ascend the steps, a couple of things. One, you notice the structure is very old at its base. The whitestone itself is cracked and worn, weathered, and most of it is indeed made from the whitestone from the surrounding mountains of the Alabaster Sierras, mined ages and ages ago. As you get further up, you begin to see sections of it that are newer stone, areas that have been renovated and rebuilt and made to complete this apparently once-sundered structure. As you all begin to creep up past the midpoint, you begin to notice the color change. The whitestone begins to fade away as you begin to see clusters of that same green residuum glass is now set across, smooth, almost like the limestone of a pyramid, like a top layer to it. As you begin to get further to the top, eventually the entirety of the stone and the stairs are coated in this material to the point where there's even a little bit of slickness in certain places from the smoothness. It's like chipped obsidian, how it's flaked away and has those divots in it. There is that smoothness, that glass-like texture to it. As you begin to get towards the very top of the stairway, each of you carefully keeping in line, talking to each other quietly, you begin to see the central structure at the top of the platform begin to appear. It is a simple, four-walled structure made purely of this dark jade glass material. There's a slight overhang with a few platforms that seem to hold this, for lack of a better term, awning-type platform that hangs over the entrance to this. You guys are about to reach the lip. Is there any preparation you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (quietly) I would like to rage.\nMARISHA: Does the building seem– is it completely encased?","response":"DM: The building is entirely encased in this material."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And they're already inside?","response":"DM: You haven't gotten to the very top of the lip yet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I see? I'm raised above, right?","response":"DM: You see, as they're having this conversation, they talk a bit with Vax, speak with Cassandra, then they step forward and begin to open the two doors to the central chamber."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Can I ask a clarification question? The mojo they have on me: do I think they're my best friends in the world, or is it more Kilgrave; I do whatever they say, but have my own opinion trapped away?","response":"DM: You have your own opinion, you just trust them implicitly. They have to be protected."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I trust them.","response":"DM: You trust them, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Am I close to Percy at all? Or did we already separate?","response":"DM: No, you guys have already separated."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Dang it.\nMARISHA: We have to stop them before they close these doors. If they close the doors, it's over.\nSAM: Do we see them closing the doors?","response":"DM: They've just opened the doors and are beginning to enter."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Percy, go. Get their attention. Percy!\nTALIESIN: I'm heading up.\nLAURA: I'm going to stay hidden as my– oh, god– and I'm going to dip the rest of my arrows in holy oil.","response":"DM: Okay, as you're stepping up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I inspire Pike real quick, just before the battle.","response":"DM: Okay, what do you do to inspire her?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I just look at her and I say, roses are red, violets are blue, we're both gnomes, and you are so foxy!\nSAM: That's it.\nMARISHA: When I look up, can I see the ceiling now?","response":"DM: Looking up, you can see the roof is carved earth. There is no loose stone; it looks like this chamber has been carefully hollowed out over time."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I see a root system of a really deep-running tree?","response":"DM: Currently? No, you cannot."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fuck. Okay.","response":"DM: Percy, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm walking up the steps. I'm putting the mask on.","response":"DM: As you put the mask on and you begin to ascend, you can feel the nerves tickle your belly and you know what you're about to encounter, and doing so, you feel that heat rise in the back of your neck, and as you do, (whoosh) the smoke begins to billow out from under your collar and out of your sleeves."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I make my way to the top of the stairs.","response":"DM: Trinket coming slowly behind you. They open the doors and they're beginning to step into the chamber."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Sylas!","response":"DM: They stop. Both Lord and Lady Briarwood look over their shoulder."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A moment of your time.","response":"DM: They look at each other, (sighs) close the chamber door. Sylas reaches out and grabs something or pushes something that's out of sight, and then they both turn and begin to step forward a little bit, with Vax and Cassandra flanking them, stopping right outside of the doors."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay, as he's distracting them, get in position? Try and stealth behind these buildings?","response":"DM: So you guys are on technically that side and that side of the pyramid right now."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah. It looks like there's pillars and shit?","response":"DM: Yeah, the pillars are evenly spread around the entire chamber."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, let's come in from the back. I don't know what the gnomes are doing.","response":"DM: You guys would have to have come around the corner, and this is the walkway here, so you'd be coming in from this side."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Stay out of sight, but get as close as we can.\nLAURA: I float closer in the darkness.","response":"DM: Okay, over here?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Up. Up.","response":"DM: Up, up? My platforms seem to have gone missing for the preparation of this game, but we'll say for the time being, you are up here."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: My hands are on a device which I have made that's on my hip that I'm ready to begin using at a moment's notice.\nSAM: It's a French tickler.\nTALIESIN: It's the most ticklish French tickler you've ever seen, baby.\nLAURA: I don't have something planned. I'm just going to go.\nSAM: What's this? What's going on?\nTALIESIN: We have debts to settle, Sylas.","response":"DM: “And apparently, you and your friends are obnoxious enough to not stay dead.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: They were kind enough to make sure that I made my way here to face you.","response":"DM: (chuckles) “Well, perhaps this evening won't be so boring after all, will it?” And Sylas looks over to Delilah."}
{"prompt":"Delilah gives him a look, too, and says, “Very well.”\nTALIESIN: The darkness demands your soul, Sylas. I'm going to cast Hex on Lady Briarwood and pull my smoke bomb at the exact same second and throw it at them.\nLAURA: I let go of my arrow and cast Conjure Barrage with a holy arrow at them.\nMARISHA: And I'm going to, if I can peek around the corner, start lighting up Sunbeam. They're in a nice, pretty line, and I like it. It's hot.","response":"DM: It will take you a moment to get over to that point because you guys are just coming around the corner. So, first things first. Percy, you lob the smoke bomb. (thud, hiss) This area here fills with a billowing smoke."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I was shooting it right in front of them.","response":"DM: Yeah, it fills this area here. It's a 20 by 20-foot– it's essentially a recreation of the Fog spell for a short duration. It fills that vicinity there. As the smoke fills, you want to Conjure Barrage into the smoke?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, I know they're all there, and it shoots a cone of arrows at them.\nLAURA: It's holy arrows. All of them will be holy arrows, because Conjure Barrage uses whatever kind of ammunition I have shot.","response":"DM: That it does."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that's a good question. Conjure Barrage is– dexterity save.\nLIAM: Surprise, motherfucker!\nLIAM: I don't know why my sister is firing at me, but I would like to use Uncanny Dodge or Evasion, whichever is applicable in this moment, so I don't get hurt.\nLAURA: There's a whole lot of arrows flying at you, just letting you know.","response":"DM: I believe Uncanny Dodge, you just roll a saving throw, and if you make it, you take no damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So dexterity, right?","response":"DM: I believe so, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's pretty good. That's a 28.","response":"DM: Okay. Damage on that was?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 3d8, plus whatever the holy would be?","response":"DM: The holy is an additional 1d4 radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, for each?","response":"DM: For anybody that would be affected by it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Oh, that's it? I just do that? 3d8, that's it?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nine.","response":"DM: Nine. Not including the d4, right?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Not including the d4.","response":"DM: So that's four damage to both Sylas and Cassandra. You take no damage from it because of Uncanny Dodge."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I call out and say, Vex'ahlia, what are you doing?\nLAURA: Two.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to start running. I'm booking to the right, and I don't have any more actions, do I?","response":"DM: No, that's going to be your go. Everyone now? Roll initiative for the beginning of the Briarwood battle."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ugh, oh my god.\nMARISHA: I have the shittiest fucking initiative rolls.\nTALIESIN: That's stupid.\nMARISHA: Yeah, so is mine.\nTALIESIN: Getting it all out of my system now.\nLIAM: Me too. I call it dying.\nSAM: Nobody.\nMARISHA: Nobody. We all ate it.","response":"DM: 20 to 15?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 17.\nTRAVIS: 15.\nSAM: I have the highest initiative?!\nLIAM: 16.","response":"DM: 16?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is a problem.\nMARISHA: Fuck. We don't get the drop on them because we were sneaking around?","response":"DM: Nope. 15 to ten?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 11.\nASHLEY: 13.\nTALIESIN: Ten.\nTALIESIN: Worst initiative I've ever rolled.\nLAURA: 11.","response":"DM: 11, and Pike, what did you get? Sorry, Taliesin."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ten.\nLAURA: We're going to die.\nLAURA: All my dice. Every dice! I don't have any dice left to roll.","response":"DM: At this point in time, Delilah steps this way, outside of the smoke, (coughs) moving out of the way. You can see, there is a slight shimmer around her form at the moment."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: A slight shimmer?","response":"DM: Yes. She is going to begin by looking over to you, who threw that bomb at her, put out her hand, and say–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Can she see me?","response":"DM: She stepped out of the smoke."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, because I moved. Bomb, then ran.\nSAM: There's smoke between them.\nTALIESIN: There's smoke between us.","response":"DM: In this area? Oh, yeah, so she would look around, get out of the way, look for you, sees nothing but a bear that has climbed to the top."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I turned into a bear. It's Willow!\nLIAM: Is it a bear, or is it fat Percy?\nTALIESIN: It's fat Percy.","response":"DM: Technically, it is. She looks very confused for a second. “Percy?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wait, question! Am I still Percy?\nLAURA: You still look like Percy.\nLIAM: If she's fooled by a fat Percy, she's surely fooled by a svelte Percy. Does she think she has Percy? What's going on?","response":"DM: This Seeming spell has fucked everything up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So she can see big Percy, but realizes it's not big Percy.","response":"DM: It's not big Percy."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's just absurd.","response":"DM: She can see a bear wearing a Percy costume, is how it looks to her."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's a bear wearing a Percy costume.","response":"DM: She actually looks around and sees the weird Percy, sees nobody else in the area– she can't see you because of your stealth, even though the Conjure Barrage was in the middle of the fog cloud, it prevented her from keeping sight on anybody, and you're out of the way, so the only thing she can see right now is weird Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I wanted to use my bonus action to hide.\nLIAM: I see her confused look, and I call out, we're all Percy! Get it?\nLAURA: 29.","response":"DM: Okay, good to know. She, not really knowing what to do, goes, “Sylas. Take this boon.” She puts her hand out, and you can see a bit of dust form in there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Take this spoon?\nTALIESIN and TRAVIS: Boon.\nMARISHA and TALIESIN: This spoon!","response":"DM: She casts a spell on him. That ends her turn. And then she steps back into the side of the fog there."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: She inspired him?","response":"DM: You don't know."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: She helped him.","response":"DM: Scanlan, you're up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I come around the corner.","response":"DM: Okay, you're about here, so you can move forward."}
{"prompt":"SAM: The second I see her, Delilah, I will cast Lightning Bolt on her.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lightning Bolt? She's immune.\nSAM: I don't know anything.\nSAM: Actually, are they in a line? Is there a way I could get in a line?","response":"DM: Not with this pillar there, no. This pillar's blocking the way. Right now, you're only seeing her, at this point, since she goes into this fog cloud, so you can throw it in the direction she is, if you want to."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I wouldn't know anything about her, so yeah. I blast.","response":"DM: You release the bolt of lightning. Roll 8d6 damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Were you there for that fight?\nSAM: I don't know. Was I?\nLAURA: Yeah, you were there for that fight.\nSAM: Would I know anything?\nLIAM: That was ages ago.\nLAURA: It was a long time ago.","response":"DM: You recall that lightning seemed to not have the impact it usually does."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Would I know that enough not to cast it?","response":"DM: I would say, through all the thoughts and preparation for this fight, if you would like to rescind that, you would be ready to Lightning Bolt and be like, “Wait, no. That didn't work.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's a great idea. Spectacularly great idea.\nLAURA: Silence her would be good, too.\nSAM: Through my Hand Cone of Clarity.\nSAM: It would be 19.","response":"DM: And what is the saving throw? Is it wisdom?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I'm sorry. Blindness. Oh, Jesus. I never use it, so I don't know. Blindness is a constitution saving throw.","response":"DM: Constitution for Delilah. Yeah, she makes it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She makes it?","response":"DM: Rolled 18 plus three. 21."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Bitch.\nSAM: So I wave at her.\nSAM: Hi.","response":"DM: She vanishes into the smoke cloud that Percy had left."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is that my movement?","response":"DM: You can move a little closer if you want to."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I get the pillar between us?","response":"DM: You can get there."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And can I see anyone else?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Then that's it.","response":"DM: Okay, that ends your turn, Scanlan. Vax, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What do I do in this situation? I trust them, but I also trust them?","response":"DM: You trust them both, and right now, they've made an aggressive action against the Briarwoods. The next one you see, you're probably going to go ahead and try to make an aggressive action."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to do whatever you tell me. Were I to see her, the most important person to me in the world, act on Lady Briarwood, I'd be like, “What's up, that's Lady Briarwood, kill her?”","response":"DM: You would try and attack her to try to convince her to stop the assault, probably."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, and I've seen Trinket and I've seen Scanlan?","response":"DM: You've seen Percy."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I've seen Percy?","response":"DM: Scanlan you haven't seen yet. You're still inside this cloud. All you've seen is Percy. You didn't even see her strike at you, other than seeing the arrows flying in so you know it's her."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Then I'm going to step right in front of Lady Briarwood and shield her with my body from Percy.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Percival, you've got to stop. This is madness! This is that spirit of yours.","response":"DM: Grog."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can they see me?","response":"DM: You're just now coming around the side here, so it's hard to tell. You see a big cloud of smoke."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm going to hold my turn.","response":"DM: You're not going to get any closer?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'd like to put my back against the column.","response":"DM: You use double movement to–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fall over. And then?","response":"DM: To move right there behind the pillar with your back to it. Okay. That gets us to Sylas."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh boy.","response":"DM: Leaping out of the smoke, (whoosh) with an unnatural speed, Sylas, jumping in the air, pulling from the scabbard on his back a long, onyx two-handed sword you've seen once before. Leaps and lands right before you, Percy."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: He can see me? He can find me in the smoke?","response":"DM: He leapt out of the smoke."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay.","response":"DM: And has a really high passive perception. He leaps and lands right before you with this grin on his face, the blade out in front of him, and says, “Boy, you poke where you shouldn't.” And goes in for three attacks on you with his blade. That's a natural two, so 12? Oh, no that would be 14? That is a 34?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 34 hits. The other two do not.","response":"DM: Oh, 24?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 24 still hits.","response":"DM: And then that would be his turn, so two hits."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Slow him down.","response":"DM: You take 13 points of slashing damage from the first strike, and then you take ten points of slashing damage from the second strike."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 26 points.","response":"DM: I need you to make two constitution saving throws."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 23 points of damage.","response":"DM: And make two constitution saving throws."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Sorry, just updating my sad little hit points. Two constitution saving throws?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 11?","response":"DM: Okay, and the second one?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A critical fail.","response":"DM: Okay. You feel as each strike of the blade cuts into your flesh, a portion of your body's strength is sapped from it. Your strength goes down by two."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: My strength is a negative one.","response":"DM: No, I mean your score. Not the modifier, your score."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, so my strength is at zero, then.","response":"DM: What is your strength normally?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 12.","response":"DM: 12, so it's now ten."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's now ten, which means my modifier is zero.","response":"DM: You see the energy fill him now."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'd take that turn now, if I could.","response":"DM: You used your movement and you held your action. You can now take your action."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Break his head like a melon.\nTRAVIS: I can't get to him now. I used my movement.\nLIAM and LAURA: Chain!\nTRAVIS: I'll use the Chain of Returning, with the holy oil on the war hammer.","response":"DM: Okay, so as you're behind the pillar, you see him rush up and slash into Percy. You reach around and (throwing noise) release the axe, spinning towards him with the chain behind it. Not the axe, the hammer."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 27.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Get him.\nSAM: That's the first Briarwood damage.\nTRAVIS: 15 damage with the fire and the holy oil does an extra–","response":"DM: 1d4."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 16.","response":"DM: Okay. 16 points of damage on the strike. (impact sounds). It slams into him from the side. He looks over and you can see where it hit; there's a burst of radiant energy that's burning into his side. He glances down at you with a frustrated look. Go ahead and make your save to try and pull your hammer back."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's a 21.","response":"DM: Okay. So that finishes that turn. Pike, you're up."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to use Healing Word for Percy.","response":"DM: You have to get within range of him though. You're on the opposite side of the battlefield, so, at full movement you'd be there; with the range on Healing Word, you wouldn't be able to get to him right now in time."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Even with a 60-foot range? Am I close?","response":"DM: 60 foot?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: She can't see anything, so she's 80 feet away.","response":"DM: Almost. He's 15 feet outside of your range. Unless you use your Sprinter's Boots."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'll use my Sprinter's Boots.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh god. Just know Ashley, that sprinting in like this will take you right in front of the Briarwoods.\nASHLEY: Oh, because I can't see the board.\nLAURA: Yeah, that's not a good thing. Maybe it's better to–\nMARISHA: Can you help Vax? You're really close to Vax.\nASHLEY: Oh, am I close to Vax?","response":"DM: You are near Vax, yeah."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I get right behind him and cast Greater Restoration on him?","response":"DM: You can. The fog obscures them; they have three quarters cover. You can still see their shapes in the cloud, it's not completely obscured."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And there's a pillar between you and me in the middle of a 30-foot stretch.\nLAURA: So you can hide behind it after you cast it.\nASHLEY: Can I try that?","response":"DM: You can. So you rush up, around the pillar, clicking your Sprinter's Boots to give the distance, you rush up into the cloud, right into the face of Vax. And Vax, you look down at Pike, now aggressively coming towards you. Protecting Lady Briarwood, you pull your daggers out instinctively and look down at her with a look of “What are you doing?” You reach forward and reach out your hands against him. Let me check Restoration real fast. Let me see here, Greater Restoration. 5th level. Ends effects like charmed or petrified. As you reach out and touch him you feel the impact of the Briarwoods' influence fade from your mind. As she touches you, the charm is dispelled and you look at your daggers and look where you are and look at the moments and the last few minutes and you're like–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Then can I look up and stay in a defensive stance and back towards Lady Briarwood?\nSAM: Oh, feigning?","response":"DM: You know what, make a deception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 12.","response":"DM: Okay. You back up into a defensive position towards Lady Briarwood. Okay, that's just from immediate reaction to that. Pike, do you want to stay where you are, do you want to use the rest of your movement to move back behind the pillar?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Cover.\nASHLEY: I'll move back behind the pillar.\nSAM: Any bonus moves there, Pikey?\nASHLEY: No. I'm going to wait.","response":"DM: Vex, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Me? I'm going to shoot my storm arrow. I'm going to shoot from my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. At Lord Briarwood. At Sylas.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Well, Percy. That one didn't work. That's a natural one for the first. That's three arrows, though. The second one's good, that's a 25.\nLAURA: And the last one is a 29.","response":"DM: Okay, those two hit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, so that is an extra 1d6 lightning damage for every attack. 15 for the first one, and then… 15 for the second one.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And that was – Oh no. Yeah, that's it. And that's the first attack. The second attack is another shot.","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: With a holy arrow. At him again.","response":"DM: Yup."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, so 25.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: Keyleth, what was your initiative again?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Bringing up the rears.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 15, for the last hit, too.\nLAURA: I use my bonus action to hide again.","response":"DM: Okay. Well you're still out in plain sight. Unless you're pulling way, way back. If you want to pull back towards the shadow."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I want to hide.","response":"DM: Okay. So you pull further and further away from it. Go ahead and make a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Natural 20.\nTALIESIN: I just got blasted. What's that thing I can do? I'm going to use a bonus action to do my little healing surge that I can do.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: My fighter ability thing, which is 1d10 plus 12, so that's 18 points of damage back.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Nice.\nMARISHA: Good roll.\nSAM: Catch that, Pike? He healed himself.\nTALIESIN: I brought myself up a little bit. Just a little bit. And I'm going to shove the Diplomacy glove right into Sylas's face and try and do a straight shove to get him off of me. I have never used this before. I don't actually know how it works.","response":"DM: Right, and you previously charged this–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I charged this when I got hit by the lightning attack in the crypt.\nMARISHA: Oh, that's right!","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a melee attack. So this would be, I'd say–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Dex check?","response":"DM: I'd say make it dex-based because it's more of a quick grab on your end. Make a d12 plus your proficiency, plus your dex. So plus ten. It's plus ten."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Plus ten to a d20.","response":"DM: Yes, you got it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Thank you! That's much better. 22.","response":"DM: 22 will hit! So as you reach out and grab him in the front the energy pulses in front as it releases. Go ahead and roll 4d6 points of damage. Did not make his saving throw on that with a four."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh my god! He rolled three sixes and a five.\nTALIESIN: 23 points of damage.\nSAM: Hi.\nMARISHA: What you going to do?\nTALIESIN: I'm going to, Jesus Christ, okay! I can't really use my gun because I'm too close. I'm going to pull out my sword and take two more slashes and I'm going to run like a mother.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: First slash is a 28.","response":"DM: Hit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And that's lame. That's 14 points of damage.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Second slash is 23.","response":"DM: 23? Okay, it hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And that's 11 points of damage. Now I'm going to book it towards Grog.","response":"DM: Okay. You're bolting towards Grog. He's going to swing at you with the sword as an attack of opportunity as he does so. That is 21 to hit."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That hits.\nSAM: Oh no. The strength thing.\nTALIESIN: I know.\nMARISHA: Good thing you don't use strength.\nTALIESIN: No.\nSAM: Well, it can still kill you.\nTALIESIN: 15, 16, 17. 22.","response":"DM: Okay, you resist the effects of the blade now, having saved from it. That ends your turn. At the end of your turn, Sylas is going to go ahead and spend one of his legendary actions to get a free movement without provoking attacks of opportunity and shift up with an amazing speed to the other side of both. As soon as you rush over to Grog he appears up in front of you grinning with his blade at the ready, right next to you and Grog. That ends your turn. It's now Cassandra's turn."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, god damn it, what are you going to do?\nTALIESIN: Make the right decision, girl!","response":"DM: Roll a perception check, Percy."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh!\nTALIESIN: (blows raspberry) Nine.","response":"DM: Nine? Roll a perception check, Grog."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Come on, Grog.\nTRAVIS: 11.","response":"DM: Okay. Seemingly out of nowhere, Cassandra appears from behind the pillar, blade out, shortsword at the ready, and attempts to jam it into the back of Grog."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sneak Attack damage. She's a rogue!","response":"DM: That is 21 to hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That actually hits me.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You can hear all the dice he's picking up.\nTALIESIN: Oh, goddamn it.","response":"DM: 27 points of piercing damage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Halved, because I'm raging.","response":"DM: Slashing damage because it's a sword, but yeah, halved."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 13?","response":"DM: 13 points of slashing damage from the sneak attack."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That could have been worse.","response":"DM: That will end Cassandra's turn. Next up is Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh! Finally. Okay, running up the stairs, running up the stairs–","response":"DM: Well, you've been waiting around the side here for everyone, so you're just now cresting around that corner."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Beautiful. Can I move to where I'm in a nice pretty line with a Briarwood and Cassandra? Over here? And Sunbeam!","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yes!\nTALIESIN: (sings) Deo gratias!\nMARISHA: Right in a line.\nSAM: Do it. This is it. This is everything, right here.\nLIAM: Come on, Kiki.\nTALIESIN: You're our cannon.\nMARISHA: I've been waiting.","response":"DM: Sunbeam. Yeah, it will hit both him and Cassandra and Grog."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And Grog?\nTRAVIS: Who cares?\nTRAVIS: Constitution.","response":"DM: Cassandra makes it with a 21."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 16?","response":"DM: 16. What's your DC?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 17.","response":"DM: So full damage on Grog, half damage on Cassandra. I mean no damage. She's going to use her reaction to use Uncanny Dodge, so Cassandra takes no damage from it. Sylas is going to use one of his legendary resistances to automatically succeed on his saving throw, so he takes half damage. Oh, they had disadvantage on the saving throw, but he can automatically make it, so never mind."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 15 plus eight, so that's 23. 23.","response":"DM: 23 damage?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes.","response":"DM: Okay, halved. He takes 12 points of radiant damage. So as you rush around the corner, he sees you appear again and gives you a look. As the beam of light appears, his eyes roll back in fear, and the blast (fire noise) streaks out, blasting into Grog, blasting into him–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Undead and oozes have disadvantage on saving throws.","response":"DM: Correct, but he has the ability to automatically make the saving throw, as a legendary creature. However, as the beam fades, you can see part of his face is burned to ash, and you can see where the lip is gone, the teeth are exposed, and the sharp fangs."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I don't know if this makes any amount of difference, but for the duration of the spell, I have a 30-foot radius sunlight glowing in my hand.","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So it's bright in here now.\nLAURA: I like it. Now I can see. Oh, shit!\nTRAVIS: As long as he's in that circle.\nTALIESIN: Yeah. Just keep on him.\nMARISHA: Yeah, it's a 30-foot radius.","response":"DM: Okay, so that ends Keyleth's turn. Back to the top, Delilah. Delilah is now going to step out of the cloud, which is now dissipating at this point."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is she taking a step away from me?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm taking my blade with the poison on it, and I'm going to slash at her.","response":"DM: Okay, as your reaction."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is an 18.","response":"DM: 18 would hit her."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, that had whatever that poison is that I sold my soul to a hag for.","response":"DM: Yes, it did. So roll damage on that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so the regular damage is–\nLAURA: Don't say you sold your soul to a hag.\nLIAM: Let's deal with one problem at a time! That's a ten for just the damage.","response":"DM: Okay. Roll an additional 6d6 poison damage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 6d6?\nLAURA: That's a Sneak Attack.\nLIAM: No, this is poison. I'm not in a position to sneak attack.\nLAURA: But this is the same as a sneak attack.\nLIAM: 12, 13, 19, 24 points of poison.\nLIAM: I just stare with a half-cocked smile.","response":"DM: She immediately looks back at you and says, “You boy, stay still!” And puts her hand out towards you. I need you to–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Advantage, because I'm a half elf. I don't need anything because I'm a half-elf.\nLAURA: Is she blinded?\nSAM: It didn't work.\nLIAM: Is she trying to charm me or hold me?","response":"DM: Nope!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Trying to disintegrate me to death?","response":"DM: She looks over to you and mutters under her breath (foreign word). It's a phrase you've never heard before, but as soon as it happens–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: As soon as she does that– do I see this?","response":"DM: You're just around the side of this."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I do not see it.","response":"DM: You glance around the side for three-quarters cover. Roll a perception check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's a dead roll, a dead roll, it's between two. That's terrible. Four.","response":"DM: Yeah, you do not see this happening, unfortunately. Your mind suddenly goes blank as the Power Word that's spoken suddenly stuns you in place, unable to react."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is it a wisdom thing?","response":"DM: There's no saving throw. If you have less than 150 hit points, you are stunned for the next minute. You have to make a saving throw every turn to resist it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay! She's strong.","response":"DM: So you stop there. Your daggers (clanking noise) drop to the ground as the smoke begins to dissipate around you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do the daggers then shunt back up to my belt, though?","response":"DM: Just the cycle?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah man, she's powerful. I will step out again, from behind. And I will try again. But this time I will say, hey, you paralyzed my friend, let's see if you like it! And I'll try to hold her. Hold Person.","response":"DM: To Hold Person, okay. A DC of 19, you said for that?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes.\nSAM: That's Vax near me, right there?","response":"DM: Vax is right there, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to– shit. Hide behind you?\nLIAM: Sure, I'm bigger than you.\nSAM: I will use my bonus action to inspire Percy, and I'll say, (sings) Percy's got a gun. Percy's got a gun. And then, yeah. Sure! I'll try to duck behind Vax for cover.\nLIAM: The whole world's come undone.","response":"DM: Okay, that'll get you to about there. Okay! That'll end your turn. Vax, you're up. You spend your turn staring off into space. At the end of your turn, make a constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. Right now? 14.","response":"DM: 14. Yeah, unfortunately you're still caught there, staring off into the darkness. Looking out over the rest of this cavern before you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's a constitution?","response":"DM: It's a constitution, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.\nTRAVIS: I'd like to go into a frenzied rage, and I would like to see and swing away at Lord Briarwood.\nTALIESIN: Yeah!\nTRAVIS: Well, he left. Cassandra's there.","response":"DM: You can still move during your turn if you want to. But if you want to go after Cassandra you can."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: She would get an attack of opportunity, wouldn't she? I'm going to turn her into applesauce.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Sorry. Not really sorry. 21.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Same thing, 21.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And a 14.","response":"DM: 14 misses."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17. 24.","response":"DM: 24 damage, on the first one?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 24 for the first one. And 22 for the second one.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: But she doesn't take any holy damage off of the oil on the thing, right?","response":"DM: No, but as the hammer slams into her armor she gets slammed against the pillar from the impact of it. She tries to right herself and push off against the wall. You use the momentum to spin around and hit her in the other side, slamming her up against the wall on the side of the structure and you hear her breath escape and she goes (gasping breath). Is having to catch her breath. And she looks at you with this look of “That really hurt!”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'll stay where I am.","response":"DM: Okay. That ends your turn. It is now Sylas's turn. Sylas, looking over this way. He does not regenerate any hit points, because of the multitude of holy and radiant damage he took last turn, his regeneration is stunted at the moment. He has to keep away from Keyleth. He is going to, instead… he's in a rough place. Then he's going to move one, two, three, four, five, six… Nope! Actually, he's going to– you know what? He's going to take it. He's going to go ahead and boldly step into the sunlight, which puts him at disadvantage with his attacks. But he is going to unload on you, Percy, who he marked previously."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He marked you?","response":"DM: You marked his wife. So that is a 20?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, that hits.","response":"DM: Second strike is– two natural 20s in a row. With disadvantage, he still crits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Two natural 20s in a row!?","response":"DM: Yeah, so with disadvantage he still crit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Fucking bastard.","response":"DM: The last one is a 23."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: With disadvantage he still crit, how?","response":"DM: I rolled two natural 20s in a row."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, you– yeah, right.\nTALIESIN: I'm so excited about this new character I'm working on.","response":"DM: 14 points of slashing damage from the first strike."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Jesus. Okay, 14.","response":"DM: The crit is 27 points of slashing damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh boy.","response":"DM: And the last one is 13 points of slashing damage. Roll three constitution saves."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll tally up the damage in a minute.","response":"DM: Actually, ignore the last attack. Because technically, Lady Briarwood would have lost her concentration on the Haste spell she had on him from the damage she took earlier."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ignore the last attack?","response":"DM: Ignore the last attack."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So that would have been– my first save is 13?\nTALIESIN: And that's 22, yeah.","response":"DM: So you resist the effect of the two strikes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to figure out how much damage I just took.\nMARISHA: 41.\nTALIESIN: No, it's 27, 37– oh, 41, you're right. I'm alive.","response":"DM: Okay. So that ends Taliesin's turn. Pike, you're up."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Pike!\nASHLEY: What are you at, Percy?\nTALIESIN: I'm at the other side of the world, but you could probably get close enough to do something if you ran and not get in anybody's way.\nSAM: He's hurting, but he's not dead.\nLAURA: But he's pretty close to dying.\nASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Sprinter's Boot over to him.","response":"DM: How many times can you use Sprinter's Boots?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Say again?","response":"DM: Sprinter's Boots. How many times can you use it? Does it say on the item? How long does it last?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I can use it twice. I haven't used it yet.","response":"DM: Okay. You're now within 35 feet of him."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. Is that within range?","response":"DM: For Healing Word it is, yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What about– oh, sorry.\nTALIESIN: We can inform her of the map though, since she doesn't have a very–\nASHLEY: Okay. So I can't Cure Wounds because I'm not close to him, right?","response":"DM: Exactly. You have to be right next to them."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. So let's do that. Oh my word, I'm shaking so bad. Okay, here we go.","response":"DM: So go ahead and roll for the heal on that."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Just rolling.\nLIAM: You're all the way in Vasselheim!\nMARISHA: You're so far away.\nASHLEY: 26.\nASHLEY: Five. Sorry, I did five.\nSAM: Do it!\nASHLEY: Shoot. Okay, I'm not close to him.\nLIAM: Can you unleash some holy fire on any fucks?\nLAURA: Yeah! Like a radiant blast or something?\nASHLEY: Can I take my Mace of Disruption and slam it on the ground?","response":"DM: If you want to!"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh god. Wait, how close am I to Sylas?\nSAM: You're 15 feet from Sylas and 15 feet from Lady Briarwood.","response":"DM: Well, 30 feet from Sylas and 15 feet from Lady Briarwood."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. You know what? Let's just do a Sacred Flame.","response":"DM: Sacred Flame? Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: She's 20 feet from Sylas.\nMARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Sorry, guys. This totally sucks.","response":"DM: So dexterity saving throw. He does not make his dexterity saving throw. 1d8 radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. And then can I use Scanlan's extra?\nLAURA and SAM: That's only on the attack.","response":"DM: Not for damage. So just roll 1d8."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Eight!\nLAURA: I know. I am going to cast– nobody's in a clump anymore! They keep moving around!\nLIAM: That freaking wizard woman, man!\nLAURA: I'm going to attack Lady Briarwood with just two attacks.\nLIAM: That's good! Chip her down!","response":"DM: And you keep Trinket here by the steps?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket's going to run next to Vax.\nLAURA: Okay. And then I'm going to shoot her a couple times.\nLAURA: Okay. 23 for the first?","response":"DM: Okay, because I forgot to do this on the last attack, we're initiating now. Her image is shifting based on her location, so you have a disadvantage on the attack roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Natural 20.\nLIAM: But the last one was good, so 23.\nLAURA: Yeah, the first one was a 23.","response":"DM: 23 hits."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Natural 20 again!","response":"DM: Okay. You do not have disadvantage. After you hit her, the effect vanishes. That is a natural 20 against her. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 17 for the first one. And then what do I do, just double the second?","response":"DM: Roll damage, then double the dice roll."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 19 for the second.","response":"DM: Okay, cool. So (arrow whizzing) the arrows both strike into her chest (pained grunt). The shimmering to her form vanishes for a second. You can see her cloak falls limp momentarily. She looks off into the shadow and sees you floating above."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hide!","response":"DM: You attempt to hide? Right now you're just pulling in and out of the shadow? You shoot and you're going to have to try and back up even further. Probably out of your attack range to disappear again."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Instead of backing up, can I go sideways?","response":"DM: You can try to get over this way, but you don't have enough movement to get there. You'd get about there and still be out in the open this turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: It's one of those things where you're just out in the sky right now. Initially, when there was the overhang and they were covered in the smoke, it was easier for you to hide in the shadow. But now you've made yourself known, you have nothing hiding behind you and her."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I go below where the steps are to hide? Behind the wall?","response":"DM: You would be able to get right about level this turn, and next turn you could go beneath. So you would not be able to hide as an additional this turn."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, then I want to stay high. And I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Hunter's Mark on her.","response":"DM: Okay!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh man! I should have done that at the beginning, but I thought I was going to hide again. What a waste.\nTALIESIN: God-fucking-damn it.\nMARISHA: How many of those fuckers does he have?","response":"DM: Oh, he gets three every turn."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He gets three every turn?!\nTRAVIS: Every round.\nSAM and TALIESIN: 30?!","response":"DM: He rolled a 19 and a 20. My rolls for him have been pretty good these past few rounds. So that's another 13 points of slashing damage against you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And make another constitution saving throw.\nMARISHA: How are you?\nSAM: Pike helped.\nTALIESIN: 13 points of damage?","response":"DM: Yep! And then roll another constitution–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Saving throw. That's 18.","response":"DM: 18? You're fine. Okay. Continue with your turn?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Still, he keeps getting in my shit. There's just no getting the fuck away from him, is there? That's fine. Well he's in the 30-foot radius of light right now, so do my attacks have an advantage against him?","response":"DM: No, he just has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. There's just no backing away from him right now. I'm going to have to wait for him to try and break off from me through Grog.\nMARISHA: He wants you. He wants your bod.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, I get it. So, everyone wants my bod. I'm going to take three slashes with the sword again since I'm too close to use the guns.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 25?","response":"DM: 25? Hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 14?","response":"DM: 14 misses."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You got inspiration!\nTALIESIN: I know, but I don't want to waste it on this. And 13.","response":"DM: Only one strike hits. Twice you pierce, he's just too fast, on one side strikes off his armor harmlessly. One strike does manage to get over the collarbone of his armor and pierce into his chest. He goes (groan) from the pain. Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He's got more where that came from though. He's a very inspiring person.\nTALIESIN: I want you to inspire other people. 12.\nTALIESIN: Save it for a shot.","response":"DM: Cassandra is going to– actually, she's going to move alongside, still staying next to Grog. And moves up with her blade out towards you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Goddamn it.","response":"DM: Looks over at Sylas, and Sylas is nudging with his eyes. And she looks at you. And she drops her blade for a second. And just stands there for a second, looking at the scenario. And her turn is spent there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah!\nLAURA: She's trying! She's trying to fight it!","response":"DM: Keyleth, you're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Knock her out. Me?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. How close am I to Sylas?","response":"DM: You are currently 25 feet from him."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. Seeing that Sylas is distracted, I'm going to run up, and I'm going to put my hands on his back, and I'm going to cast Sunbeam through him and try and hit Lady Briarwood as well.","response":"DM: There is a pillar between the two of them, so it won't go through the pillar, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Then I just hug him, and I'm like, (sings) Let the sunshine in!\nMARISHA, LAURA, TRAVIS, and SAM: (sing) Let the sunshine in. The sun shine in!\nTALIESIN: Really? You're going to kill him with hugs. This is the most Keyleth thing I've ever heard.\nMARISHA: I'm trying to do a concentrated Sunbeam. I don't know if it's going to help.","response":"DM: Go ahead and roll damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Balls, fuck, shit. Ten.","response":"DM: He's going to use his second legendary action to automatically succeed the saving throw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 25, total.","response":"DM: 25, okay. So that's 13. This time, as you blast into his back you see the light burns through parts of his shoulder and chunks of his flesh are actually blown through his armor. His armor streaks open for a second. He's like, (pained grunt). Smoke is now sizzling up around him and he looks over his shoulder with this angry red gaze–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And I take my nails and dig them in a little bit.","response":"DM: At the end of your turn, he uses another legendary action to then try and shove you off and arc upwards with his sword across the front of your chest. Even with disadvantage, that's still 19."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Hits.\nMARISHA: Oh, wait. Hang on. Okay, has to be over 12, right? A saving throw? 17.","response":"DM: 17? Okay, you resist the effect of the sword. That ends your turn. Back at the top. Sylas right now is like (panting). He's looking pretty rough. Lady Delilah runs up around the side and goes, “My love, we're not ready, but the timetable's been pushed. We have no choice.” And she wraps her arms around them and they both–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I cast Counterspell as a reaction.","response":"DM: What's the range on Counterspell?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Not again!\nSAM: 60 feet. Am I close enough?\nTRAVIS: I don't think you are.\nSAM: I say– shit. Do I know what she's casting? Am I familiar with it?","response":"DM: You're familiar with the actions about it, so you'd have an idea, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I know what level it is?","response":"DM: You don't know what level, no."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, so I'll say, (sings) Huh! That's the sound of the gnome, fucking with your spell! Yeah. And I'll cast it at level four.\nSAM: Fuck, so it's higher than that.","response":"DM: She's casting it at 5th-level."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What do I roll?","response":"DM: For this, roll a d20 and add your charisma bonus to it. So plus five."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm a charismatic guy.","response":"DM: You are."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 23.","response":"DM: And with that, she grasps him. The Door begins to open, and then flickers."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Stay.\nSAM: Grog? I hold my turn.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm sorry, I hold my action and my movement. And instead I will inspire Grog with a little harmonica ditty. (harmonica)\nTALIESIN: Jaunty!\nSAM: Oh, is it his turn now, next?","response":"DM: No, it is not. You hold the rest of your turn?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I hold.\nLIAM: Constitution save at this point?","response":"DM: This would be a constitution saving throw again, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: If only Scanlan had inspired you.\nLIAM: If only. No.","response":"DM: Still left there. Useless. Staring in the distance."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Thinking of IKEA instructions.\nLAURA: Well, I thought Trinket would be able to help you, but you're not doing anything.","response":"DM: Grog, now you're up."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So for the Boots of Levitation–","response":"DM: Actually, before that happens."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Goddamn it.","response":"DM: At the end of your turn, he's going to use his third legendary action in this round to, without any attacks of opportunity, move."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is that Lord Briarwood?","response":"DM: Yes. He pulls away, still trying to get out of the range of the sunlight."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay. The Boots of Levitation. It says it requires an action to levitate?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Could I do three attacks? Or just two, and then have the action left over?","response":"DM: You could action and then you'd have your one bonus strike as a frenzied rage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can you put on the boots as a bonus action?\nTRAVIS: I'm already wearing them.\nLAURA: Just set it up.\nTRAVIS: Set it up?\nLAURA: You could do it on this move. Then on the next move–\nSAM: It's too long.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it. I'll take all three strikes at Lady Briarwood.","response":"DM: Okay! So you move in, to there. Go ahead and make your attacks."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's good. 25?","response":"DM: You have disadvantage on these strikes, as her cloak has now kicked back in."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 17?","response":"DM: 17 misses. First blow passes through her form harmlessly."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You're inspired!\nTRAVIS: I'll use that inspiration on that one. No, not on that one.","response":"DM: So the first one missed, the second one missed?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The first and the second one missed.","response":"DM: The first strike, with disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Jesus Christ. 20.","response":"DM: 20 hits. As this one actually finds purchase on her torso, the shimmering effect vanishes once again, the cloak falling limp to her side."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 19.","response":"DM: 19. Okay. The hammer slams into the front of her chest, and she goes, (panting). She's starting to get almost feral in her frustration."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Feral?","response":"DM: (growls) She's angry."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay.\nMARISHA: Look at that sexy hand!\nSAM: Mister is injured, right?\nLIAM: He's looking rough!\nSAM: And she is not flickering anymore, so I can get a good hit on her, as well?","response":"DM: Correct. Yeah, the disadvantage on attacks against her has faded."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I will go on her. I don't like her, so I'll punch her in the face.","response":"DM: Okay! Goes forward. Go ahead and roll for your spell attack against her."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, okay. Is this through the cone?","response":"DM: There isn't a cone aspect to it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, so do I just roll to hit?\nSAM: Okay. (giggles) Spell attack. 16?","response":"DM: 16. As the fist (whoosh) towards her, she ducks and it slams into the pillar, cracking the stone slightly."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Shit. How far away am I from both of them?","response":"DM: From both of them? You are about 45 feet from Sylas and about 65 feet from her."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I get ten feet closer to her.\nLAURA: (quietly) Can you inspire Vax?\nSAM: This is the rest of my turn. I already used it to inspire Grog.\nTRAVIS: With advantage?","response":"DM: With advantage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Roll. High.\nMARISHA: Roll like you're Percy!","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A four.","response":"DM: With advantage?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: Wow. With that, Grog, now you realize you've been on the wrong side of this battlefield the whole time. And your allies are being assaulted by individuals that claim to be your friends but might be completely against this whole circumstance. Your allegiance switches for now to defend them at all costs. That's going to end his turn. Pike!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Wait. I'm raging. Can I be charmed?","response":"DM: That's a good notification to make. The charm effect hits your mind. This is why you read your abilities, guys. I don't remember all the details."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Best question of the night!\nLIAM: Oh my god!\nTRAVIS: Intelligence of six. It takes a second!","response":"DM: As you see this look, you feel the influence begin to pry. But it isn't enough to push through the red and blazing anger–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah!\nLIAM: That was the thin red line, Travis.","response":"DM: With that, you see the expression of intent and some worry on Sylas's face, ending his turn. Pike, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: My turn? Okay, so I would like to Channel Divinity and Destroy Undead?\nMARISHA: Yes!\nSAM: This is what we hired you for!","response":"DM: Just as a heads up, Destroy Undead, for the most part, is only effective against lower-level undead. Knowing that Sylas is a vampire, it might not have the desired effect that you're thinking it might."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: Just as a heads up. You can still Turn Undead and it may make him afraid of you. But that is–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Let's give it a try!\nTRAVIS: I like it!\nASHLEY: How close am I to him?\nLAURA: Pretty close.\nLIAM: Pretty close. 20 feet.\nASHLEY: You know what, I feel like I want to hit him with my Mace of Disruption.","response":"DM: If you want to!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He's rough.","response":"DM: So instead you run up, charging towards him, shield up in front of you. Pike, her blazing radiant form, the energy rippling off from behind her. You pull back your mace, and as it swings through the air, a quick flicker of angelic wings appear at your back as your mace swings down towards him. Go ahead and roll your attack."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Come on. Okay, 16. But I'm going to use War God's Blessing and add ten.","response":"DM: Yes, you can do that."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: War God's Blessing?","response":"DM: Okay. War God's Blessing."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: She has inspiration from you too, right?\nSAM: But has she rolled yet?","response":"DM: Yep, when any creature within 30 feet makes an attack roll you can use your reaction to grant that creature– usually it's against other creatures. Okay. War God's Blessing you can only use on other creatures, but you do have Channel Divinity: Guided Strike, which you can use on yourself. It's essentially the same thing. You give yourself plus ten bonus to the roll."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: So you use your Channel Divinity: Guided Strike instead?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Got it.","response":"DM: Okay. So that would bring you to 26? That would hit."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.\nLAURA: Kill him!\nLIAM: A thousand pieces.\nASHLEY: How many times do I roll?","response":"DM: Well you roll your damage, and it does an additional 2d6 radiant damage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Damn!\nLIAM: The mace damage–\nASHLEY: Okay, got it. Sorry guys, sorry. I'm back.\nLIAM: Break into a million pieces.\nLAURA: I love you, too. Your headset looks really pretty!\nASHLEY: Thanks!\nTALIESIN: It's like looking at the Technicolor logo.\nTRAVIS: Everybody get their heads down, like Ashley.\nASHLEY: Okay, 21!","response":"DM: 21 points of damage?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, as per the effect of the spell, he now has to make a wisdom saving throw, which he does succeed. If he failed, he would have been destroyed. However, on a success, he is still afraid of you. So he is now considered afraid of Pike. Disadvantage on all attack rolls."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Fuck yeah, he is! Let them know, Pike!","response":"DM: Until the end of your next turn. Awesome, Pike! Anything else you want to do on your turn, or is that it?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I would love to go up to Vax, but I don't think I can, right?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. Then I'll stay, I'll stay.","response":"DM: Okay, that ends your turn Pike. Vex, you're up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Awesome, I'm going to shoot him.","response":"DM: You're going to shoot Sylas?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, with holy arrows.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That does not hit him. Come on. 19?","response":"DM: 19 hits. Just barely."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 17, plus two holy damage.","response":"DM: So the first attack missed?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: And the second one hit?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah. 19.\nLAURA: I'm afraid my flying potion's going to start to wear off soon, so I'm going to move. Is there a roof? On that middle compound building?","response":"DM: From what you can see, no. It is open."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, really?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I land on top of the pillar?","response":"DM: The pillar holds a slight overhang, so you can land on top of the overhang if you want."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah!\nLAURA: But I can still see–","response":"DM: You could peek around if you want."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, okay.","response":"DM: Okay. Percy, you're up."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to pull out the Pepperbox. And I'm going to take a shot at Sylas, and I'm going to get him to drop his sword.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So, let's see.\nSAM: You're not going to kill him?\nTALIESIN: Nope! Not yet. Just in case things go bad– and I also just want to make sure– that's a 26?","response":"DM: Hits. No damage, but he drops his weapon?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: But he drops his weapon.","response":"DM: So with that, (bullet impact) the blade he was holding clatters to the ground before him, the onyx blade shining in what low light there is around this temple."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Now I'm going to take a shot at him. That's a 29.","response":"DM: Hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That does… ten points of damage?","response":"DM: Ten points of damage? As that bullet hits him (soft impact) you see he begins to dissipate. And then turns into a mist form in the space where he is. He is currently now a form of mist."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So he can go heal himself unless we can get him.\nTALIESIN: She's going to take care of this. How close am I to Lady Briarwood?","response":"DM: You're ten feet from her."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Ten feet? That's close enough, I guess. I'm going to take a couple of steps back, and I'm going to do a fire shot and an ice shot with my last two shots.","response":"DM: Well, you've already done two shots."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. I'll fire shot with my next shot. Does she currently have advantage or no?","response":"DM: No, because it has not come back to her."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm going to also put sharpshooter on that.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yay. (counting) 26 to hit?","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So that's– plus–\nSAM: Is that her right there? No that's Cassandra.","response":"DM: That's Cassandra. That's Briarwood, right there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, and plus the Hex! So that's (counting) 24 points of damage plus two points of fire damage.","response":"DM: Whew, nice. The shot (bang) blasts into the side of her face. You can see part of her jawbone is cracked as part of this, and her ear is blown off to one side of her face, (choked groan) and she cradles it to her side as (grunts)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Like a ketchup packet!\nTALIESIN: Let's spend an action surge and keep enjoying this!\nLIAM: Our cleric giggles from Vasselheim.\nTALIESIN: Why don't we take a–\nLIAM: If there's a time to blow your wad, it's now.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, let's take a… violent shot on top of that.\nLAURA: Violent shot?\nTALIESIN: I use the violent shot action with the ice damage. Let's see what that does. Natural 20! This is going to be ugly as fuck.\nMARISHA: Of course.","response":"DM: And this is all piercing damage, right?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh my god. This is so fucking bad, is what this is about to be. Oh my god, this is going to be so– let me get these additional dice. Okay, so let's start doing this. Do all of the dice rolls get doubled?","response":"DM: All of the dice for this roll."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: All of the dice for this roll. Oh boy.","response":"DM: Roll the dice and then double it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay.\nMARISHA: High rolls. Big money, no whammies. It could be worse.\nTALIESIN: (counts quietly) 42 points of damage plus eight points of ice damage.","response":"DM: Okay. This blast hits her in the side of the shoulder, and the cloak catches fire for a moment before dispersing, and you can see the impact. There's blood now seeping into her robe. She's looking rough, but you've noticed with each of these shots, the impact you're used to doing with these shots is not doing the full impact you would expect, especially with the force of these blows. Every shot you've taken on her in particular. That ends your turn?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, I've still got two more shots. Actually, I get my grit point back from that because that was a natural 20, so that was a free shot.","response":"DM: When do you reload, by the way?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have two more shots, and then I have to reload. I'm keeping track. I'm being good. Let's hit her in the legs.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 20 to hit?","response":"DM: 20 to hit. This is with your minus five? Are you taking a sharpshooter shot on this?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah. 20 to hit?","response":"DM: You rolled a what?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, 20 total to hit.","response":"DM: Right. Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I rolled a 13.","response":"DM: Yeah. Okay, so that does hit, yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Because she has her disadvantage. She needs to make a constitution saving throw.","response":"DM: 22?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: DC equals eight plus my proficiency mod plus my dexterity mod.","response":"DM: Plus ten, so 18."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: She made it. She didn't fall, but she still takes some damage, so let's see what she does. Ten, 12, 22, 28 points of damage.\nTALIESIN: And because this is really annoying me, I'm going to give her a gut shot. Torso shot. Same thing, sharpshooter.\nLIAM: I'm seeing this all in slow motion.\nMARISHA: Throwing bullets.\nTALIESIN: 27 points of damage. And she has a disadvantage on strength and dexterity checks for the rest of the round. For one full round.","response":"DM: Good to know."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to back up a little bit, for the rest of my–","response":"DM: Over here?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah, that way.\nLAURA: Get out of her view?","response":"DM: Sure. That ends your turn, Percy?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Damn it, girl!\nSAM: I gave her one. I gave her a greater.\nLAURA: A greater? We wasted a greater?!\nSAM: I'm a nice guy! I can't resist the charm of a woman, especially one who looks identical to you.","response":"DM: Her wounds close up a little bit. The ear wound heals over a little bit, and she wipes her mouth. “Thank you, dear. Sylas! To the ritual!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's a mist.","response":"DM: Keyleth, it's your turn."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do it. Do it, girl!\nLIAM: Burn him.\nMARISHA: Okay, so I turn and I start shouting to the mist and I say, what's the matter, Sylas? Afraid of a little gnome and a druid? And I blast him with Sunbeam.\nTRAVIS: Good line.\nMARISHA: Thanks! I'm not good with lines. Keyleth isn't good with lines. Are you afraid of us? I heard Percy try to do lines, and I'm like, that's what badasses do.","response":"DM: I guess in this particular instance I want to ask you: How do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sorry, cursed gun!","response":"DM: There's still a semi-visible form of his body, but in a mist form. It's trying to slowly escape off the top of this structure."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Pike is standing right next to him?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going to use Pike and use the light that I have off Pike and combine it to do a joint Sunbeam, holy bomb.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Boom.","response":"DM: Great."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He's going to eat a bag of holy dicks is what you're saying, right?\nMARISHA: Yeah, I want him to eat a bag of holy dicks. Now explain that, please. Make it sound great.","response":"DM: So. Looking over at Pike, already ready with her mace up in the air and the mist recoiling from her. You glance at each other, have that connective point, and as Pike brings up her shield, you bring back your Sunbeam and throw it towards the shield, arcing it in his direction as she ricochets the reflection of the actual sunlight back at him at the same time."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That was way cooler than what you said.\nMARISHA: Yeah, way cooler! I knew he'd bring it through.","response":"DM: As it sprays across, the beams themselves seem to form nearly phallic rays."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: High five, Pike!\nLAURA: How does it feel, Lady Briarwood?","response":"DM: She, looking over her shoulder, still looking at him as she's called to him to go join in the altar room, the ritual room, looks over and sees his mist form. In slow motion, from her perspective, she sees Keyleth step forward, wind blowing around her, releasing this beam and watching him be disintegrated.  Immediately, her eyes open wide and she screams out, “No! Sylas!” and you can see her whole body shaking now. The horror of seeing her partner, the love of her life, disintegrated before her. Tears immediately burst down her face, and her hands are shaking there as she screams out, “You can't! I broke the world for us! No.” That's the end of your turn?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: May I ask a question?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Does Cassandra's charm come from Sylas or Lady Briarwood?","response":"DM: At this point, you have no idea."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What about yours?\nLIAM: From Lady Briarwood, yeah.\nSAM: The lady.\nLAURA: The lady.\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nLIAM: Somebody hit her. Hit her!","response":"DM: She's still in combat with you, so you don't get an attack of opportunity. Keyleth, you do, if you want to try and swing towards her."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I use my sunlight that I have up?","response":"DM: No, you have to make a combat strike."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: My staff?\nLAURA: Trip her!\nMARISHA: Can I go for a trip?","response":"DM: No, this is just a melee attack."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fine, I'm going to bean her in the head. Natural 20!","response":"DM: Okay! Roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We've got the MVP over here.\nMARISHA: 12 damage! Bam!","response":"DM: Crack! You hit her in the back of the head as she stumbles forward and looks about the rest of you. She is using her last 5th-level spell to attempt to cast another Dimension Door, out of the sight of the one who previously dispelled it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I Counterspell that?","response":"DM: You have no visual on her. She is behind the pillar. This time, she knew where you were and was not about to let that happen again. She disappears behind the pillar, and you guys watch her step into the doorway and vanish from sight."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Seriously?","response":"DM: She's still Hunter's Marked."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: She's Hunter's Marked!","response":"DM: You still have Hex on her, for as long as that lasts."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That lasts a while.\nLAURA: Is he under the thing, still? Or did it break?","response":"DM: The flight lasts for an hour. The potion lasts for an hour, and it's probably been about–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, she's asking if I'm still–","response":"DM: You currently? Yes. Make another constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on. Big roll. 13 plus nothing is 13.\nLAURA: I float down in front of him and slap him across the face.","response":"DM: Like that? Okay. Make another saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Nope.","response":"DM: Okay. You slap, slap. He's taking it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I go over to Vax?\nTRAVIS: Cassandra's still up, right?","response":"DM: Cassandra is."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm going to Remove Curse on him.","response":"DM: Okay. You cast Remove Curse. Let me see. This is not considered a curse, so as the spell alleviates its energy into Vax, he still stands there, staring into space."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god.\nTRAVIS: Oh, wait, are we slapping Vax? Let me try.\nLIAM: Yeah. You said something about a minute before, though, didn't you?","response":"DM: Yeah, so a little time goes by and then eventually it wears off."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to start looking at that door.\nTRAVIS: Is Cassandra still there?","response":"DM: Yes, she is."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I grab her by the neck and walk her to the edge of the pyramid?","response":"DM: Yeah. You grab her, lift her. (choking noise)"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, no! No.","response":"DM: Drops her weapons as Grog takes her to the edge."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, let's not. Let's not.\nTRAVIS: Why not?\nLIAM: I walk up to Grog and her, and I face Percy and repeat what Grog said. Why not?\nSAM: Is he still under her spell?\nTALIESIN: She's been here a very long time. Let's just knock her unconscious and let her be.\nLIAM: I turn towards her, and I punch her across the jaw as hard as I can.","response":"DM: At this point, with the damage she's taken and the mental shock she's in and the current circumstance, the one hit (whack) clocks her, and she goes unconscious in his grip. Limp."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You can handcuff her behind her back.\nTRAVIS: We do have manacles.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nSAM: Put her in the Bag of Holding.\nOTHERS: No.\nTALIESIN: Thank you.\nLAURA: Maybe Greater Restoration her.\nASHLEY: Yeah, can I Greater Restoration on her?","response":"DM: Do you have another level of that spell?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: No.","response":"DM: Then you cannot. It's a 5th-level spell."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We can save it for later.\nASHLEY: Keyleth?\nTRAVIS: I take some of the manacles, and I manacle her hands behind her back.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What's up, Pike?\nASHLEY: Do you have Greater Restoration?\nMARISHA: Not on me. Not today.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to start working with that door.\nTRAVIS: And to be super shitty, I grab a length of rope and wrap it around her ankles and tie it back to her hands so she can't stand up.\nLAURA: Oh. Sorry, Cassandra. That's going to suck.\nTRAVIS: She's got to stay there when she wakes up.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I pick up Sylas's onyx sword?","response":"DM: You can, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What does a common healing potion do, by the way?","response":"DM: It'll require a short rest to attune and get the nature of it, but it is a very beautiful new weapon."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Okay. I'll put it in the Bag of Holding.\nTALIESIN: You picked up his sword? Good. That's why I had him drop it.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I noticed.\nMARISHA: So he wouldn't disintegrate with it?\nTALIESIN: Yeah, and so one of us, possibly me, could use it.\nSAM: Have a better sword than your piece of shit?\nTRAVIS: Do you want it?\nMARISHA: We have to find her. She's somewhere close.\nTRAVIS: I'll give him the sword. He's got the onyx sword.\nSAM: I'll pick it up and look at it.","response":"DM: Okay. These items will take a little time to look over."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'll look at it for a whole ten seconds.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Do I get my strength back, by the way? I'm just down?","response":"DM: Just down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I see, from being on the roof, what's inside the building? You said there's no roof to that temple I was up on top of.","response":"DM: Correct. If you're looking inside of it right now? You glance over. It's an open-roofed square construct. There are two hallways that lead to the inside on both sides. The walls have a strange icy texture to them; it's hard to make out the details from what little light is in there. There is a central platform that rises up in the middle. There is a stairway on the opposite side of the room that leads up to that platform, and there are a series of grooves in the ground that form some sort of shape that you can't make out from this viewpoint. You do see Lady Briarwood atop that platform right now."}
{"prompt":"SAM: How far?\nLAURA: She's inside the temple.\nTALIESIN: Let's go in. I took a minor healing potion. Is that 2d8?","response":"DM: A minor? A regular one is 2d4 plus two."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Here, I'll trade you one. I trade him a greater for a common. I take the common.\nTALIESIN: What's the greater do?\nSAM: Greater is 4d4 plus four.\nLAURA: Can I drop the rope down from the roof where I'm at, so everybody can get up in?","response":"DM: Get up and over? Yeah, you can do that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. I'm going to do that.","response":"DM: Okay. It'll take you a while to do that. As you drop the rope–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't know if you want to try the doors, but I just thought we could get in.","response":"DM: Okay, you lower the rope."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to walk up to my sister and take her hand and squeeze it as hard as I can, and just walk forward with her.","response":"DM: She's up on top of the roof. She lowers the rope and starts taking you guys up one by one. Vex, you do notice out of the corner of your eye as you lower the rope, there is a flash of greenish light from the center platform, and from the distance, you can see Delilah is up on the platform reading from some sort of scroll."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How far away is she?","response":"DM: She's about 80 feet from you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I pull out Bad News.","response":"DM: None of you guys can see her. Only she sees her. You guys are still on the ground. She's on the roof."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I lowered the rope so you guys can start climbing up.\nTALIESIN: I'm climbing up.\nLIAM: Can I see her, if I've gone up to her?","response":"DM: You're the first one to climb up. She just lowered the rope, so you're finding your way up now. You haven't even seen her yet."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ugh. Can I shoot at her?","response":"DM: If you'd like to, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I want to.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Percy, get up the fucking rope.\nTALIESIN: I'm heading straight up there.","response":"DM: What's your range increment for your longbow?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't see it.","response":"DM: I'll look it up under the equipment section in the book."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It doesn't say on the–\nLIAM: I'm going to start throwing as soon as I'm near my sister.\nSAM: Oh, Vax. Hi.\nLIAM: Hi.\nLAURA: You can't throw 80 feet.\nLIAM: No, but I could get closer.\nLAURA: No, you can't. We're on the roof around it.\nTRAVIS: A real man could throw 80 feet.\nLIAM: That's true, Grog. That's true. That's a good point.\nLAURA: I feel like it's 120 feet.","response":"DM: It's 150 feet, so yeah. There's no serious issue there. You can go ahead. You have disadvantage on the strike."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I do?","response":"DM: Because her image is still shimmering."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's great, then 13.","response":"DM: 13. Arrow (whoosh) disappears into the darkness."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I hit her again?","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What is the relationship to her, if I've just gotten next to her?\nSAM: She was married to Sylas.\nLIAM: No, shut up, you. Where are we, and where is she?","response":"DM: Okay, so if you want to come up to the top and start looking."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh god! That looks like a big hand.\nLAURA: It's a Bigby Hand!\nSAM: You know what they say about guys with Bigby Hands?\nMARISHA: Bigby Gloves?\nLAURA: 20 was the second arrow that I shot at her.","response":"DM: 20? 20 would hit."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Percy, are you up there yet?\nLIAM: Are we on the edge of a ledge or a wall?","response":"DM: There's a ledge that goes around the entire wall that encases this, but there's no roof. It's just an open square area. So you would get up to there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I go up next?\nLAURA: Can I maybe go through the piece of paper that she's reading?","response":"DM: That would've been something to call before you shot her. Next attack you can, if you want."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So you said Jennifer Lopez is 80 feet from us?","response":"DM: Roughly, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I head up, as well.\nLAURA: 19 damage to her is what I rolled.","response":"DM: 19 damage? Okay. Strikes her. The arrow hits and gleans off her. The damage, much like Percy's, is not quite having the full damage you want it to. However, as that hits, she reaches into her pocket and pulls something out. Percy, you get to the top there. Who's up next?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'll go.\nASHLEY: I'll go.\nSAM: I'm always behind Pike.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to take 80 feet–","response":"DM: Well, before that happens, as a reaction to that, she pulls something out of her hand. There's a streak of red light that arcs upward, and there's a slight shrieking sound as a familiar arcane blast hits, a Fireball bursts on the roof area around all of you. (explosion noise) I need a dexterity saving throw from all three of you guys up there."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Who's up there right now?\nLAURA: Do we get advantage on it at all?","response":"DM: Nope."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 15. Can I use Uncanny Dodge at this moment?","response":"DM: You mean to lower that damage by half?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah.","response":"DM: You can, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What, is she casting a spell?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I can also use Evasion.","response":"DM: You failed the save."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Right, but depending on what it is. Those both do different things. Okay, they do the same thing. Sorry.\nTALIESIN: 25.","response":"DM: 25 for your dex?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I rolled a 19.","response":"DM: That's great."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 16.","response":"DM: 16."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It was a 15, so half damage.\nLAURA: Another 18 points of fire damage?","response":"DM: No, just to them. You took full damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, okay.","response":"DM: Okay, next person at the rope?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Me.\nTALIESIN: Can I fire now?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It's 80 feet? It's within the Pepperbox range. I'm going to shoot for the scroll with fire.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, good call.\nTALIESIN: That rolled really low. I can use that bonus die. I rolled within my–","response":"DM: Misfire?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Can I use the–","response":"DM: The natural roll is still what counts for misfire, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to try and fix it.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No.","response":"DM: Pepperbox is broken."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Have I recovered at all to shoot again? Have I recovered enough to shoot at her again?","response":"DM: You will in a second."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Pepperbox is completely broken.","response":"DM: Yeah, unusable."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh no, if only we had another gun.\nLAURA: I know.\nSAM: Oh, wait. We do.\nLAURA: Bad News.\nSAM: No, we have another gun.\nTALIESIN: We have two more guns.\nMARISHA: We have Ripley's gun.\nSAM: Give it to me.\nLAURA: Are you up on top?\nSAM: No.\nLAURA: I can't give it to you.\nTALIESIN: Do I still have– are we still–","response":"DM: You have one more attack."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Bad News.\nLIAM: Matthew.","response":"DM: Yes?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're very good at this.","response":"DM: What do you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's it. I just want to say you're very good at this.","response":"DM: (giggles, sighs) We're running a little late. Trying to get through this climactic moment, guys. Apologies."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Are we running late?\nTALIESIN: Don't look.\nMARISHA: It's fine.","response":"DM: Sorry, guys."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Crew hates us.","response":"DM: I know. It's okay. I'll make it up to them. At this point, the scroll (fluttering noise) vanishes. She, as a bonus action at the top of this turn, gashes across her wrist and spreads her own life's blood across what looks to be this dark orb, about a foot in diameter, that's resting in the center of this upper platform."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I take a potion really fast?","response":"DM: At the top of your turn, you can, as a bonus action."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The orb is floating?","response":"DM: The dark orb in the center of the platform that she's currently on in the center of this room. It's half-embedded in the ground, and she scatters her blood across it. You can see her shaking with fear and trepidation during this whole circumstance."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: She splatters her blood on the dark sphere?","response":"DM: Make a perception check, those who are up top, by the way. Who's up next?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Jesus Christ. 16.\nMARISHA: One.\nLAURA: What are we trying to do?","response":"DM: Perception. Scanlan gets up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hey. Hi, guys! What's going– oh.\nLIAM: 20.\nSAM: She's bleeding all over that thing?","response":"DM: Those who got 15 or higher, you notice the writhing on the walls. The walls are encased in what looks like a tapestry of bodies. Hundreds of humanoid individuals that are woven into each other, each missing their left hand and/or left eye from their body, and they're all just squirming and writhing. Many of them are in various states of decay, and they're just moving after that ice that was encasing them had shattered. There's a low, weird moaning drone that's beginning to fill the room. The black orb itself is starting to rise out of the center of the pedestal, as well. Now, Vex, since you had the top of this, and Vax. What do you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wait, there's an orb coming up from where?\nTRAVIS: The center of the pedestal.","response":"DM: The center of the platform she's on."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She's got blood on it. She's doing a magic ritual.\nLIAM: And we're how high in the air from the floor that she's on?","response":"DM: I'd say you're about 30 feet up. She's about 40 feet up. She's actually risen a little above you guys."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to guzzle a potion, and then I'm going to shoot Percy's special arrow, question mark? At the orb.\nSAM: At the orb? You're not going to stop this with an arrow. It's happened already. It's done.\nLIAM: If I go to the very edge, how far am I from her?\nLAURA: Then what am I supposed to do? Killing her, what good will it do?","response":"DM: 55 feet away."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Maybe she's a sacrifice, at this point.\nLIAM: That's within range, right?","response":"DM: Of your daggers?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah. I'm throwing, then, at her.","response":"DM: What's the throwing dagger range?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 60 feet, because I'm sharpshooter, so I take no disadvantage.","response":"DM: Then…"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I don't like her.","response":"DM: 20/60, so yeah, you can still hit her."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, so I'm going to throw two daggers at her. I don't know if there's any poison left– I'm sure there's not– on the Life-Stealing, and the Keen. First one is not good at all. That's a 14, and the second one hits. That's a 28. That is the Life-Stealing. That is seven points of damage.\nLAURA: I had said I was going to shoot the orb.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Plus, you're left-handed, and she apparently has things against lefties.\nLAURA: Yeah, exactly.\nLIAM: You flicked me in the left nut. Are you complicit?\nTRAVIS: You don't know.\nLAURA: 23?","response":"DM: 23? Okay. That does hit the orb. Roll damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't know what I'm doing!\nLIAM: Let's see what happens.\nLAURA: 15?","response":"DM: Okay, the arrow streaks off and seemingly hits the orb. Splinters across the surface."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It was the arrow, question mark.","response":"DM: Oh, it was the explosive one? Oh, okay. The arrow arcs off. Did you roll with disadvantage on that one because it is the explosive arrow?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh shit. No. 15.","response":"DM: 15. The arrow whizzes past and slams into the bottom of the pillar. You see a muffled explosion and light flash, and it rocks the center a bit, but she still maintains concentration. She looks over at where it came from."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should I have shot her? I'm sorry. I should have shot her!\nSAM: It's fine. It wouldn't have done anything.\nMARISHA: Can I try something? Am I able to try something? Is she still bleeding all over this orb?","response":"DM: The bleeding has finished. The orb is rising up and pulsing."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Question.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Did we surprise her?","response":"DM: No, she is well aware of you guys."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She's well aware that we're here. Did I go before her? Is there initiative here? Did I go before her turn?","response":"DM: Right now, as people arrive, I'm counting this. I'll probably do initiative after we finish this set."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I still fly?","response":"DM: You can still fly if you want, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: How far?","response":"DM: 55 feet."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Am I going soon?","response":"DM: We're getting to that now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I think this is going to be shot down, and I'm fine if it is, but I know that with Assassinate, if I go before the enemy does, it's an automatic critical.","response":"DM: This is one of those circumstances where you guys have been already in combat. This isn't a scenario where you got the jump on them. She's aware that you guys are there and she's just trying to finish this while ignoring that circumstance."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to pull out a fancy robe from my bag and I'm going to try to fly towards the orb.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: While she does that–\nTALIESIN: Keyleth's got shit.\nMARISHA: It's not going to work, but I can try.\nMARISHA: Okay, so you could argue that our bodies are made of 70 percent water, right, so if I cast Control Water, can I move her blood?","response":"DM: You can certainly try. Her blood has already cast across the orb and it seems to have initiated whatever is part of it. There's not still blood pouring onto it; she scattered across it once."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So wiping the blood off probably wouldn't work?","response":"DM: You can try."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Let's say no.\nLIAM: If she rolls really high. Really high.\nTALIESIN: How good do you feel about a natural 20?\nMARISHA: “How good do you feel about a natural 20?” Well, judging by the shit that's been going down today– fuck it! I already said it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do Control Water and I'm going to see if I can suck all the blood off of the orb.","response":"DM: Okay. Roll a d20, add your wisdom modifier."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Oh, did you see that?\nTALIESIN: I did. That was cruel.\nMARISHA: It was on a 20.\nTALIESIN: And then it bounced.\nMARISHA: 15.","response":"DM: Okay. Focusing from this distance, you try to– The blood shifts across the surface, but there is some sort of power that's holding it to the orb. It is unmoved. I know. Scanlan?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I've got one shot at this, right?\nLIAM: Yes.\nSAM: I'm going to try to cast– I can't cast anything anymore. I'm going to try to cast Suggestion on her, and I will say, Stop, collaborate and listen. Because I'm a gnome who's on a mission. Follow me as I kill your husband the lich, and I'll make you my bitch.\nTRAVIS: Her husband was a vampire.\nSAM: Oh, yeah. Whatever.","response":"DM: It didn't rhyme. It's fine."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on. Hail Mary pass, here we go.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Suggestion is a– oh, she probably can't be charmed. It's a wisdom saving throw.","response":"DM: Okay, she rolled a 19. What's your DC on that?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 19.","response":"DM: 19. Yeah, with the cone."}
{"prompt":"(groaning)\nLIAM: Good attempt, though, Sam.\nSAM: Never mind! Carry on!","response":"DM: Percy?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to take a shot with Bad News because this is getting really ridiculous. I'm going to try and get her attention and get her to pay attention. Let's have a normal roll. Oh, for the love of God!\nMARISHA: No.\nLIAM: One? 20?\nTALIESIN: So, Bad News–\nLAURA: Misfire?\nTALIESIN: Just barely!","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And I can try and get one more bullet to come out of it at this point, so I'm going to make one last attempt to make it shoot, after clearing the chamber. Better! Jesus H. Christ. 24.","response":"DM: That'll hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on. Coup de grace.\nMARISHA: Coup de grace.\nTALIESIN: This is at least going to get her attention.\nMARISHA: At least distract her. Come on, Percy. That was a 12 on a d12, which is dope.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, that's 21. 27 points of damage.","response":"DM: Okay. So the (gunshot noise) blast from Bad News scatters through the air and slams into her side, and she's nearly thrown off the top of the platform from the blast of it. You can see blood streaking down her other arm now, and she has blood down the side of her face, down one arm and the other, and she's shaking in place on the platform. She sees you lifting towards, holding the robe to the side, and she's looking at the orb, and doesn't even seem to really know what's going to happen. There's this anticipation and fear in her eyes. Everything's been torn from her, at this point. She's a caged animal with nothing to lose. That finishes your turn. Taking her turn, she sees you rushing towards her. She extends her finger–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, wait! I took a potion. I took a potion! I said it on the last turn, and I didn't use it.","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I don't know how much to roll for a greater healing potion. That's why I didn't do it.","response":"DM: That is 4d4 plus four."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (whispering) I'm going to die.\nLIAM: No. No.\nLAURA: No, I'm serious. I'm going to die right now.\nLIAM: No! Shut up. Four and– pretty good.\nLAURA: Okay.\nLIAM: That's good.","response":"DM: What are you at?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 76.","response":"DM: Okay. She extends her finger towards you with a look, and there's this point of recognition, this moment, where you're like–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I know that.","response":"DM: I need you to make a constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"SAM: There's no attack, there's no nothing? There's no roll? I can't Cutting Words this?","response":"DM: Nope."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can't Cutting Words?","response":"DM: Yep."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can't Cutting Words the damage?","response":"DM: It's not a weapon attack, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Damn it.\nLAURA: 11.","response":"DM: Nope."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait, 13.\nSAM: This is it. This is it.\nMARISHA: No.","response":"DM: 45 plus 30. 75 points of necrotic damage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But you were at 76?\nTALIESIN, MARISHA, and SAM: Oh my god.\nLAURA: Am I close to it?","response":"DM: You've moved up to this point. Now you're right at the edge. The orb suddenly shrinks in a flash of an instant, becoming this tiny speck, this little dark speck in the air, roughly the size of a dime. And that's it. She waits. “No, no, no, no! It can't be too soon. Please! Please.” And she falls to her knees. She's staring at this dark speck in the air. The writhing walls of the room fall quiet again, all the bodies no longer moving. You, floating through the air? Your flight ends. You immediately plummet."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I cast Hold Person? On her?\nSAM: On her?\nMARISHA: Yes!","response":"DM: If you want to. It's just going to paralyze her."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I can't hold her?","response":"DM: No. So at that height, it's 40 feet. You fall. You take 3d6 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I roll for acrobatics? Maybe I can catch myself.","response":"DM: You know what? Roll acrobatics with disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. I don't know where a d20 is.\nLIAM: 20, and? Six.\nLAURA: Acrobatics?\nLIAM and LAURA: 15.","response":"DM: You take four points of fall damage. As you slam down into the center of this."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And I'm unconscious.","response":"DM: You're unconscious on the ground. (thud)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's my first time I've ever been unconscious.\nMARISHA: I thought you were going to die.\nTALIESIN: She's still connected to her rope, though, isn't she?\nLAURA: No. I took out a fancy robe. I was going to trap the globe.\nLIAM: Whose turn is it?\nASHLEY: Can I get to her?","response":"DM: You guys are up on this roof right now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm leaping. If you let me leap, I'm going to leap and take an acrobatics check.","response":"DM: Acrobatics check, go for it."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20. Natural fucking 20!","response":"DM: Landing on your feet."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Parkour!\nLIAM: I have a potion with my sister's name written on it, and it's going in her mouth.","response":"DM: That's as far as you get on your movement, right there."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm right there?","response":"DM: That's your full movement to get to her. You can't do anything else."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I can't do anything else? I can't do a bonus action? I can't do nothing.","response":"DM: Well, you can do a bonus action, but it's an action to feed a potion to somebody else."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Then I'm throwing a knife at Lady Briarwood, which I can use a bonus action to attack her.","response":"DM: On the ground, you can't see her. She's 40 feet up on the platform. She's completely out of your visual sight. You're down inside this hand groove that's dug in the ground."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Pike!\nASHLEY: Can I get to her?","response":"DM: You're on top of the roof. You're going to have to leap down to get to her. You're too far away."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: She's got time.","response":"DM: Actually, you could try a spell if you want to."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Say again?","response":"DM: You can try a spell if you want to. She's about 50 feet from you, at an angle."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. I'll do a Healing Word.","response":"DM: Okay. As you pull up your holy symbol and begin casting the spell, the divine energy seems to be pulled from your hand, and the spell has no effect."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So magic doesn't work?\nMARISHA: Is it because we're in this fucking room?","response":"DM: Do you want to stay where you are?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on down. Let's party.\nTRAVIS: I'll go next.","response":"DM: Grog, you've gotten up now, with the rope, to the top. Anybody else want to go?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'll take a shot at Lady Briarwood, since I'm up here.","response":"DM: Go for it. And you aren't forgetting your Hex damage on her, right?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I was. I forgot it on the last one. I remembered that I forgot it. That's 24 to hit.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 13, 14, 15, 16– 22 points of damage.","response":"DM: How do you want to do this?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You get to kill Lady Briarwood?\nLAURA: Do it with as little blood as possible. I'm dead.","response":"DM: You're unconscious."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm unconscious.\nTRAVIS: I think, if you kill her–\nTALIESIN: It's a little late.\nTRAVIS: Here comes Godzilla.","response":"DM: The smoke billowing from your body, the essence of this creature whispering in your ear, “Now. Do it. Do it!” Bad News, freshly repaired, loaded."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's your birthright.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to take– oh my god. I'm going to take a shoulder shot on her right arm, and I'm going to try to cleave her right arm right off with the shot and see if I can leave her unconscious.","response":"DM: Okay. Roll damage. This is going to be a constitution saving throw for her, if she can survive this wound as (gun blast)– the right or left arm, you said?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Right arm.","response":"DM: Right arm. (gun blast) Blasts open, the bone exposed. The arm spins off and clatters to the ground behind her. With that blast, she falls backward onto the steps behind the platform. (impact noises) Falls off the steps, falls out of sight behind the pillar. You don't even see where she is. She falls out of visual range."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We don't know if she's unconscious or dead?","response":"DM: You don't know."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to circle around to her right now.\nLAURA: You're not going to try to heal me?\nLIAM: No, I know. Oh, shit.\nLAURA: You're not going to heal me?\nLIAM: Yes, I am. Fuck that.\nTRAVIS: Can I jump down, then?\nLIAM: I'm feeding a potion to my sister.","response":"DM: Acrobatics check?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Thank you.\nTRAVIS: 18.\nLAURA: Trinket's at the door going, (sad bear noises).\nSAM: I can move within 30 feet of Vax?","response":"DM: You'd have to get on the ground to do it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 23.","response":"DM: 23. Okay, so you only take three points of damage from the fall. You don't fall prone. Okay, so going full movement from there, you can get there. Grog, full movement. Where are you going?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'd like to go straight for Vex.","response":"DM: Vex? Okay, that would get you right there, with your movement. And then Keyleth–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm going for the black thing.\nLIAM: 4d4 plus four.","response":"DM: Yeah, you pop off the vial, you go and pop it into her mouth and take the vial away. There doesn't appear to be any effect."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: With no talk of death saves at all?\nMARISHA: Get her out of the room. Get out of the room!","response":"DM: Make a death saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Get me out of here!\nLIAM: How do we get her– Keyleth, we need vines! 11, that's a success.","response":"DM: You're okay for now."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Fuck that bitch! We need to get my sister out of this room. Keyleth, can we use vines? What can we use to get my sister out of this room now?\nTRAVIS: I'll pick her up and start running towards the door at the back of the room.\nMARISHA: What door is open?","response":"DM: Neither."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We've got to get her up and out.\nTRAVIS: What do the doors look like?","response":"DM: You can't tell from here. You're too far, and the doors are on this side and this side, and they were closed."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Percival, do you have a rope?\nTALIESIN: She has the rope.\nLIAM: I pull the rope out from my sister's side and I start lassoing it– fuck that– throw it up to Percival.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I grab it.","response":"DM: It takes a couple of tries, but you manage to get to the 40-foot top there. Make another death saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm tying it to my sister right now. Come on.\nLAURA: Oh no.\nLIAM: Fail. I've tied it around my sister. Pike, Percy, pull!\nTALIESIN: I am going to grab the rope, and I am literally just going to jump off the side and I'm going to fling her up.\nSAM: You might miss, and hurt her.\nMARISHA: She's already dead!\nSAM: Wait, before you do this: have we tried a Healing Word on her?\nTALIESIN and MARISHA: Yes.","response":"DM: 17 points of damage from the fall."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: How many?","response":"DM: 17 points."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Done.\nTRAVIS: I'll run to the door that's closest to us.","response":"DM: You manage to get her up to the top. Grog, you're the one who has her right now?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Pike, please help her!\nASHLEY: Okay. We've got to get her out of here, or nothing's going to work, right?\nLIAM: Pull her out the door and heal her! It will work.\nASHLEY: Okay, let me try to pull her out the door.\nMARISHA: Is she over?","response":"DM: No, you pulled her up onto the roof."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It might work on the roof.\nASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to try it up on the roof.","response":"DM: Try on the roof."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Healing Word again.\nMARISHA: You're touching her. You're near her.\nASHLEY: Wait, I'm touching her? Cure Wounds!","response":"DM: Okay, you go for Cure Wounds. You pull up your holy symbol and put your hand to her. Nothing's happening."}
{"prompt":"(cursing)\nLIAM: Pull her out of here!","response":"DM: Make another death saving throw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You're not going to die.\nLIAM: 12. Save.\nMARISHA: You're saved!\nLIAM: Pull her out!\nLAURA: Oh god!","response":"DM: What are you guys doing?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Where is she?","response":"DM: She's on top of the wall here. She's been lifted out by Grog and Percival."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm running at the wall and I'm trying to climb it, stupidly.","response":"DM: Okay. Roll a climb check. Roll athletics."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What about the little penny? The dime?\nLIAM: 15.","response":"DM: 15? (grunts) You get partway up. You climb over bodies. You're using the bodies on the wall to climb up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I throw Vax something real quick? Can I toss him something?","response":"DM: You can move up and do it, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No, before he runs that way. Can I toss you the Immovable Rod?","response":"DM: He doesn't even pay attention. He bolts past, towards the wall. He's already out."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Never mind. I'm trying to get to this black hole.\nTALIESIN: Good call.","response":"DM: You get up there."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I try Divine Intervention right now?","response":"DM: That's your full turn. You want to do Divine Intervention?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: What is that?","response":"DM: Roll a d10 and then another d10, and let me know the numbers in succession."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 12.","response":"DM: You are what level?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 11.","response":"DM: Unfortunately, that just fails."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I scream at the top of my lungs, pull her out of here! I'm still climbing dead bodies.\nTALIESIN: I've got hold of the rope and just trying to yell, toss her off! Because that way we can see if we can counterweight her back down.\nTRAVIS: I'm at the top, so we can gently get her down. I could jump down with you.\nLAURA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: I'll jump and hold her.\nTALIESIN: I'll ride the rope up.","response":"DM: Okay. You're on the same side as them jumping down now."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. Never mind.","response":"DM: They would come down to meet you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Have I reached the top?","response":"DM: We'll say now you've managed to climb up towards the top."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I want to pick up Pike under my arm like a fucking football and run forward after my sister.","response":"DM: You grab her and bolt off the side."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Once we hit the ground– we're outside of the room, right? Should we try to heal her? I've got a common.","response":"DM: There's going to be 14 points of fall damage to you as you land because right now you're not carefully landing. This is just clutching her and jumping off. You, make an acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's a 20.","response":"DM: 20? Okay. You manage to take only two damage from the fall. Make another death saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I believe in you!\nLAURA: Save. I've only failed one.\nLIAM: I'm planting Pike's glowing form right down on my sister's chest.\nTRAVIS: Can I put a common? I have a common.\nLIAM: You did succeed three times.\nTALIESIN: She succeeded three times.","response":"DM: Three times. No, you succeeded–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Twice.\nLAURA: Three times.","response":"DM: Three times. Yeah, so with that, as you're carrying her there, there's a moment where all of a sudden, Vex's eyes open and (deep breath). Vex is sitting there, looking around, confused, catching her breath in Grog's arms as he's bolting down the steps of the ziggurat."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Grog, you smell terrible. (chuckles weakly)\nSAM: Maybe we should get out of here.\nTRAVIS: Do something to that little ball.\nMARISHA: I'm alone with the little ball, aren't I? Okay, I'm going to go up to it. Can I tell any type of magical properties from it from looking at it?","response":"DM: Make an arcana check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, Jesus. Oh, that's good! 19 total?","response":"DM: 19 total. You have no idea what this is. You haven't seen something like this before. You inspect it very closely, and it's literally like the sphere has been shrunk to this size. You look very closely and it looks like it's spinning impossibly fast in place."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Who's still in there?\nSAM: I'm in there. I go up there, too.\nTRAVIS: Check on Lady Shithead.\nSAM: Yeah? Okay, I'm going to turn back and go to check out Lady Shithead. I don't know why I'm still in this room. We should get out of here.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to try and open the doors from that side to see if there's any way to open them.","response":"DM: Make a strength check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What is the net of dead bodies doing? Are they limp?","response":"DM: They're just limp. Still in the tapestry, arms fallen."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 11.","response":"DM: 11? Doors aren't budging."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Here, you take your sister. I'll go back to the doors.\nTRAVIS: I go back to the doors and try the doors.","response":"DM: Okay. Strength check."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I try to Cure Wounds again, on Vex?","response":"DM: Okay. You run up to Vex as she's in Vax's arms. Once again, the spell slot is expended, but no magic seems to appear. There is some sort of blockage or void of magic use in this vicinity."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Even outside of this building?\nTRAVIS: 19.","response":"DM: 19? (impact noise) The doors slam open from the force of Grog's foot, opening the passageway inside the room."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Would my Sunbeam still be up?","response":"DM: No, that's passed, for now."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I make my way over to Scanlan to go check on Lady Briarwood?","response":"DM: Sure. You eventually make your way there at a full run. You run around the corner and you can see her."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Alive? Dead?","response":"DM: She is on the ground, unconscious, sitting in this carved hand symbol in the ground."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do we want this girl alive for some reason? I can't move her.\nTRAVIS: We need to figure out what we're doing with the little black ball of universal death.\nTALIESIN: Let's get her out of there.\nSAM: Let's just get us out of here.\nTRAVIS: Could we just leave it?\nLAURA: No. Can you put it in a vial?\nSAM: Put it in a vial?\nMARISHA: I pull out a piece of that green glass that we took from before.\nSAM: Okay, that's smart.\nTRAVIS: Give it a poke.\nMARISHA: I'm going to jam it into it.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god.\nSAM: Just hit the black hole.","response":"DM: Make a strength saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Whoa!\nMARISHA: That's a natural 20.","response":"DM: As you take the glass and jam it in there, the glass, in what seems almost like slow-mo, seems to crackle and shatter like brittle stone, and immediately vanish into the darkness. As your hand gets to that point of no resistance, you feel this immediate, extremely strong suction begin to pull towards your hand, and you yank back with all your might, suffering 18 points of damage as you (grunts) pull away from this small spinning orb."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, so maybe we don't touch the orb anymore.\nLAURA: Don't touch the orb.\nMARISHA: Nothing happened to it? Still just–","response":"DM: Still just sitting there. A little speck in space."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're not leaving this thing.\nMARISHA and SAM: What do you mean we're not leaving it?!\nSAM: What are we going to do to it?\nMARISHA: It's indestructible.\nTRAVIS: We're obviously not equipped. I'll grab Lady Briarwood and drag her out of the room towards the doors.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, what's that– the horn of–\nTRAVIS: Orcus?\nSAM: The Horn of Orcus? Can that counter– we don't have it.\nLAURA: You want to put the two bad things together?\nSAM: Yeah, maybe they'll become a good thing.\nLAURA: No.\nSAM: No?\nLAURA: Two negatives make a positive?\nSAM: That's what I say to all my women.\nLIAM: I don't know what's going on, but I've got her and I'm hugging her from behind and turning my back towards whatever is in that room. I don't know what's going on.","response":"DM: Okay."}

I can go earth elemental and start ripping this thing apart.\nTRAVIS: Bury it like the pharaohs of old?\nSAM: Sure. Why not? Let's get out of here. Do you want to take Briarwood with us, or bury her in the rubble?\nTRAVIS: We can't kill her in here.\nTALIESIN: I'm afraid of what blood will do to that thing.\nTRAVIS: She kept talking about a sacrifice. We can't kill her.\nSAM: You think she was going to jump into that orb?\nTRAVIS: I think she understood she had to give a life for it.\nMARISHA: I think something was going to come through that orb.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nLIAM: Let's drag her out of here. Percy, you can shoot her in the head a hundred yards from here.\nTRAVIS: And then you can bury it once we're out of the way.\nMARISHA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: I drag her out of the room and toward the steps.","response":"DM: Okay. As you're holding her in your arms, what's everyone doing?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Everyone, get out.\nLIAM: I'm picking up my sister and lurching after Grog.\nLAURA: I can walk.\nLIAM: I'm picking you up, and I'm lurching after Grog!","response":"DM: So as Grog rushes down the steps of the ziggurat, clutching the unconscious and bleeding body of Lady Delilah Briarwood. Vax rushing behind, carrying the barely-conscious, limp body of Vex'ahlia, the rest of you racing out. You, your hand bloodied from the terrible force of whatever that was. You go charging down the steps of the ziggurat. Is anyone taking Cassandra, or are you leaving her behind?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm taking Cassandra.","response":"DM: You reach over and pick up Cassandra, put her over your shoulder, and you begin racing down the front of the ziggurat steps."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Am I tearing this place down?\nTRAVIS: Not yet. Not until we're out of here.\nMARISHA: I'll stay behind.","response":"DM: You stay behind?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you have to be there to do it?\nMARISHA: Being an earth elemental and ripping it apart.\nLIAM: She's doing it physically.\nTRAVIS: Well, let's all get to the point where it's not going to collapse on us.\nTALIESIN: Why don't we just open up the acid and let it pour down in there.\nSAM: Where is that?\nLAURA: That's so far away.\nTALIESIN: We have to go that way, anyway. Once we get there, let's open the spigot, point it towards the doors, and let it do its work.\nMARISHA: I don't know if that's enough acid to take down and destroy a thing.\nLAURA: Might as well try it. Do we have any acid? You have acid, can we pour it?\nTRAVIS: It's like three little acid vials.\nLIAM: We've got acid from a tube.\nSAM: Why don't we just seal up the hole and get out of here?\nLIAM: Let's get out of here. Keyleth, it's a good idea. Destroy the temple.\nTALIESIN: Do some damage to the temple, and then once we're all the way out, we'll open the acid.\nMARISHA: Do we want to leave a spinning black hole of death under the city?\nTALIESIN: It could just swallow the entire city and everybody could die. This is my problem, at the moment.\nMARISHA: You guys go. I'm going to tear it down. I'll be okay. I'll meet you there.\nLAURA: What?\nASHLEY: No.\nTALIESIN: She can earth shape. She'll be fine.\nLIAM: I push my sister into Grog's massive arms because he can hold fucking five people, and I start running back towards the ziggurat.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm laying on top of Lady Briarwood right now.\nLIAM: Yes. Yes, you are.\nLAURA: Great.\nTALIESIN: 70 percent of her, at the very least.\nMARISHA: I stand at the top of the temple, and I wait to see them go out of range.","response":"DM: Okay. They all begin to step down the bottom of the stairs, except for Vax, who begins running back up the steps towards you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Vax, go. No. Go.\nLIAM: Whatever you're going to do, just fucking do it.\nMARISHA: I concentrate for a minute, and I go into the ground.","response":"DM: As you focus your attention towards your earthen core and triggering the transformation effect, nothing happens."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Magic. It kills all magic!\nMARISHA: Even Beast Shape?","response":"DM: It's a magical transformation."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Never mind! Run!\nMARISHA: Fuck it! Run.\nTRAVIS: We all leave.\nLAURA: Can you try pouring acid on the thingy?\nTALIESIN: I'm going to do it once we're out. We're just going to go.","response":"DM: As Vox Machina charges down the front of the steps of the ziggurat, we'll call that for the night."}
{"prompt":"(groaning)\nLAURA: And I rolled a one right as that final.\nLIAM: For no reason.\nSAM: We killed the Briarwoods.\nTALIESIN: Well, one and a half of them.\nSAM: We didn't die. Yet.\nLAURA and MARISHA: Oh my god.\nLAURA: I can't believe I almost died again from that damn death ray!\nMARISHA: By one point.\nTRAVIS: So if you had rolled 76 points of necrotic damage?","response":"DM: She'd have been dead instantly and then come back as a zombie in the next round."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And would become what?\nLAURA: If I hadn't taken that potion right before I leapt off–","response":"DM: You would have been dead."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thank god you took that fucking potion!","response":"DM: That went a little longer than anticipated."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're a bad man!\n[no audio]\nMARISHA: I think Pike's playlist is up right now.\nTALIESIN: Hey!\nSAM: Hey, Percy? How much does that comic cost?\nTALIESIN: That comic is–\nSAM: Free.\nTALIESIN: Was free. After this weekend, it's one healing potion.\nMARISHA: That won't work.\nTALIESIN: Goddamn it.\nLAURA: A bunch of wasted healing potions.","response":"DM: Okay, guys. Thank you all so much for your patience, for your diligence, for watching this extremely–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Long.","response":"DM: Long, dark episode. We'll see you next week. Is it Thursday yet?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (mock-crying) Is it Thursday yet?\nTALIESIN: Oh, god.","response":"DM: Let's do this. Bring it in. So, to get you guys up to speed quickly, for those of you who are coming in fresh. Oh, what an episode to jump into. So, the intrepid group of adventurers known as Vox Machina had made their way to the city of Whitestone, a town that Percival here grew up in and had taken from him and his family five years ago, most of his family, the de Rolos, being murdered in the process. The Briarwoods, who had taken the town rather quickly and covertly held it for five years had now been building toward some sort of a ritual, some sort of event that the party was investigating. They incited a rebellion within the city of Whitestone, gathering the remaining members to take up arms and fight against this undead scourge that had kept them locked down for so long, oppressed for so long. After managing to take out some of the various operatives under the Briarwoods' regime, they made their way into Castle Whitestone itself, saved Percy's sister, Cassandra, thought dead for a long time, got vengeance upon a number of individuals that were on his List, except for Ripley, who got away. Fought their way down underneath the city of Whitestone, fell into an acid-based trap, made their way to the ziggurat, this construct beneath the city of  Whitestone, where some ritual was attempting to be completed by Lady Delilah Briarwood. It was discovered that the patron they spoke of, the Whispered One, had been in previous bits of history spoken as Vecna, a powerful lich of ancient history that had attempted to ascend to godhood at some point in the past. They managed to tackle the Briarwoods, destroy Sylas, defeat Delilah, and dragging them back, decided to interrogate. In the process of trying to extract information, Percy's dark harbinger, his dark passenger, if you will… who was a tongue-waggling dog for a moment."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I was making an evil shadow.","response":"DM: I see."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Evil shadow.\nLIAM: “Kill them all, Percy. Kill them all.”","response":"DM: Pressured to incite the vengeance that apparently the pact he made with this entity required. Upon fighting its will, it was jettisoned from his form and the party battled this deranged greater smoke demon-like entity in the center of this cavern. During this fight, Lady Briarwood tried to escape, however, found a dagger in the middle of her back, thanks to Vax over there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good job.","response":"DM: Stripped of her possessions, and then Cassandra dragging her into the nearby acid baths, tossing her body within to leave her story to a definite conclusion. Scanlan, being very astute, apparently, in some observations, and as convincing as he can be, managed to wrestle Percy's weapon, his List, his Pepperbox, from his grip, and tossed it into the very acid pits, destroying his greatest creation and in doing so, seemingly breaking whatever hold this shadow demon had on Percy's soul."}
{"prompt":"SAM: The Way of the Gun.\nTRAVIS: The Quick and the Dead.\nLIAM: A couple weeks in detox and you'll be fine.\nMARISHA: It's true.\nLAURA: It was an intervention, Percy.\nSAM: Had to be done.","response":"DM: Upon returning to the city of Whitestone, they found the rebellion was successful. The undead hordes had fallen to the blades of the surviving rallying warriors of Whitestone. Keeper Yennen, who currently was the, essentially, leader of the rebellion while you guys were going into the castle, met with you. You guys were brought to the center of town, where you began to see the rest of Whitestone emerge: the families, the children, the people that had been too scared to go outside finally came out to celebrate victory, the first real breath of free air they've had in five years since the Briarwoods took the city. Some justice was doled to a few survivors of the Briarwoods' regime. And you were asked to stay behind to help rebuild and prepare for the coming Winter's Crest festival, of which you agreed. A few awkward moments and a few delightful bits of interpersonal comedy brought you guys to this point and now we begin tonight's session of Critical Role. So, to start off, leading up to this Winter's Crest festival, about a two-week period, what would you guys like to individually do in this time to prepare for the festival?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We have two weeks?","response":"DM: Yeah, essentially. The two-week period, we're doing a bit of a time jump here, so if there's anything in particular you want to do or attempt in this time period, now's the time to do so before we get to the actual event."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I had a question. Could I go around lifting up various wagons and maybe ponies, working out to try to increase my strength?\nTRAVIS: Or just randomly picking shit up and not have an excuse for it. That was good, too.\nMARISHA: I mean, the town's in tatters. You could be productive and pick things up.\nTRAVIS: Yeah! Or you know, I pick up a hammer in the morning.\nLAURA: And you're helping to rebuild.\nTRAVIS: Yeah!\nSAM: Like Rocky IV.\nTRAVIS: Yeah!","response":"DM: Yeah, in a brilliant holiday montage, as the cold weather finds its way into the valley of Whitestone, Grog goes around aiding many of the groups repairing and reassembling the glory of Whitestone, finding the structures that are broken or destroyed and trying to clean them, prepare for new building properties. You come by, eagerly lifting, carrying, dropping, slamming, and holding in place extremely heavy pieces of stone and masonry. In some cases, putting a few of the local strong men to shame and some of the local ladies, very blush-worthy in your presence. You are very happy. Go ahead and make three strength checks for me."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh shit, three of them. That's a 24.","response":"DM: Okay, second one?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's a 22.\nTRAVIS: 22. 24, 22, 22.","response":"DM: Through the process of these two weeks, not only have you managed to surprise the local denizens of the city with your feats of strength and masculine physique– as when Grog is building, Grog does so shirtless."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I don't feel like I should take this.\nLAURA: You should take it.\nTRAVIS: It's a lot of money.\nLAURA: You should take it.\nTRAVIS: How about you refill my cask of ale instead?\nSAM: Ooh.\nLIAM: Happy Festivus.\nTRAVIS: And you give me one gold piece so Vex doesn't kill me.","response":"DM: The crowd look among themselves and one of the lead architects for this whole endeavor nods to you. “Sounds like a fair trade. If you're certain, sir.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm a very stringent businessman. Do hurry before I change my mind.","response":"DM: Gold piece is in your hand faster than you have a chance to– you chip a tooth."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I don't understand this practice. It tastes like shit. Tastes fucking horrible.","response":"DM: Two casks of their precious ale roll up to the base of your foot."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (gasps) Two?!","response":"DM: Two."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, I got the ring and the bracers that I need to get checked out, see what they are.","response":"DM: And the robe?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, the robe. No, I threw it down, though.\nTALIESIN: You picked it up.\nLIAM: You picked it up.\nLAURA: I have the robe, too.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We left her naked. Yes, we did.","response":"DM: You kind of did, actually."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Like properly.","response":"DM: A few things here, actually."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh Vex, I made gold.\nLAURA: Oh wow, thank you, that's amazing, Grog. Where did you find this piece of gold?\nTRAVIS: Oh, I got it for fixing a bunch of shit around town. Are you going to taste it?\nLAURA: No, I'm not. It's already got a lot of drool on it, actually.\nTRAVIS: But how do you know if it's gold if you don't taste it?\nLAURA: I'm just going to put it in with the rest of the gold, Grog.\nTRAVIS: Shit. I'm going to pull one over on her one of these days. Can you make things look like they're gold?\nSAM: I can, actually.\nTRAVIS: You can?\nSAM: Yes.\nTRAVIS: I've had my thought for the day, there's nothing else.\nSAM: When you have the punchline, let me know.\nTRAVIS: It's a standby TV symbol right now. That's all I got.","response":"DM: So, as you take some time, first off, I want you to go ahead and roll an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Aw man, I've got to roll for this? I'm going to roll one of my new dice. Well, it's for–","response":"DM: What was that sound?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It was exciting! 24.","response":"DM: 24, okay. So as you begin pulling out the items and begin separating, before you can even begin the initial inspection, as you are pulling the robe out, you find there is a slight poke. There's something thin–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What kind of a wand?","response":"DM: I'm trying to find the actual item card here. Found it! There we go."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I want it.\nLAURA: Oh my god.\nSAM: I want it.\nLAURA: Oh, did you find it? Did you find it in the group? Are you even standing near me right now, as I'm seeing this wand?\nSAM: Of course I am. I'm always with you.\nLAURA: How do you know I'm not doing it in my room?\nSAM: Are you?\nLAURA: Yes.\nTALIESIN: What's she wearing right now?\nSAM: Why I am in your room?!\nLAURA: Scanlan, get out of here, I'm naked.\nSAM: Oh I know, I came in here to tell you, to ask you something: where's my wand?\nLAURA: Ugh, I've got to look at this a bit more before I give this to you because it is very, very good. It is a Wand of Fireballs, by the way, people. It has seven charges; while holding it, you can use an action to expend one or more of its charges to cast the Fireball spell, DC of 15, one charge you cast at third level– so many words. I don't even understand.\nLIAM: A fan art of this moment, please?\nLAURA: But also–","response":"DM: You recall, actually, as you went over the top at the initial battle with Lady Briarwood, that was what she pulled out and managed to blast all of you with at once when you all were on the top of the temple."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice. I'm just going to put this in my pocket.\nLIAM: I thought you were naked.\nLAURA: I'll put it in the pocket of the outfit I'm about to put on. And then the ring and the bracers?","response":"DM: I'll get those right now. There you go."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Wait, Grog, don't sit down.\nTALIESIN: This is why it's Christmas.\nSAM: Where's my ring?\nMARISHA: What's the ring do?\nLAURA: Oh my god. I found so many amazing things, you guys.\nTRAVIS: Those are bracers–\nLAURA: No!\nSAM: Those are mine. I found them.\nTRAVIS: Grog will believe whatever you say.\nLAURA: No! I'm reading them all; they're mine! Ring of Lightning Resistance. Who wants a Ring of Lightning Resistance?\nSAM: Sure.\nLAURA: Bracers of Defense. Who needs extra defense? You're really weak. Your AC's super low, isn't it?\nLIAM: It is.","response":"DM: Bracers of Defense will technically only really benefit anybody who's not wearing armor."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Not wearing armor?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Like Grog?","response":"DM: Like monks."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: There you go.\nLIAM: Thank goodness, because he is a blushing flower in the wind.","response":"DM: If you currently have– is it an amulet that helps your armor? We'll go through your AC and find out if it overlaps with any other benefits."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I do have the Amulet of Armor.","response":"DM: Right, so basically that would replace that and you would now have an amulet slot open for any sort of future enchantment stuff."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll take the amulet.","response":"DM: You could give the amulet to somebody else if you want to."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He'll never give it to me.\nMARISHA: He was willing to do it until you gave him the idea to not do it.\nLIAM: That's fine.\nTRAVIS: Can't remind me of these things.\nLAURA: Okay, a Robe of Shielding Shadows. Can it be worn with armor?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh man. It's just a robe. It's her dress, basically, and it gives you resistance to piercing damage.\nLIAM: You know what we can do with that? Sell it.\nSAM: Or give it to me.\nLAURA: You have armor, dude.\nSAM: Oh, okay.\nMARISHA: It takes an armor slot.\nLAURA: And it's a woman's robe.\nSAM: I can make that work.\nLAURA: Yeah, you totally could.\nMARISHA: Can we take the fabric and sew it into a nice afghan or something?","response":"DM: You can certainly try. It would probably ruin the enchantment."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, it would ruin the enchantment? If you sew it differently?\nMARISHA: What if you don't cut into it?\nLAURA: What if we fold it?\nTALIESIN: What if we just tie the dress around our neck?\nLAURA: Maybe just put your arms through it and then let it ride behind you like a cape?\nMARISHA: Right, it's like one of those “wear nine different ways” dresses?","response":"DM: You can wear it however you want and you will discover one way or another if it actually gives an effect."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, I'm just going to pocket this because we may sell it, how about that. And then, a Ring of Lightning Resistance, anybody want it? How many rings can we wear at one time?","response":"DM: Two. One on each hand."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I would not say no to a Ring of Lightning Resistance.\nLAURA: Pass that over to Percy.\nTALIESIN: I've got plans. At the moment, it's the only way to charge my glove.\nSAM: I already have a wand that shoots things.\nLIAM: You're the only one who can use it.\nSAM: Oh, I'm the only one who can use it? I'll take it, then.\nLAURA: I might just sell this robe, though.\nTRAVIS: I know how you work it, it's swish and flick. Fireball.\nLAURA: Swish and flick.","response":"DM: What could possibly go wrong?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What if a non-spellcaster uses a wand? Nothing, right?\nLAURA: No. Anyone can use it.\nTRAVIS: Should we try it?\nLIAM: Yes, you should try it.\nTRAVIS: I am a walking crash test dummy. I mean, we can try it. It'll be fine.","response":"DM: That's my favorite mindset."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And then I'm going to mostly for the rest of the time, keep to myself and Trinket and I'm going to help the townspeople rebuild a bit.\nLIAM: I am also going to keep to myself and I'm going to talk to the people in town, see what businesses are open or trying to open, see what they need. And I would like to talk to Percy, since I don't know anyone here, about who I could talk to about getting messages to Emon, and I would like to get a message to Gilmore, to see if he can fill any need here. If trade is so ruined here, that Gilmore could be a help. And Gilmore gets another front, a place to do business and actually do good in a place that needs it.\nMARISHA: Gilmore's Glorious Books.\nSAM: That's right.\nLAURA: I like it.","response":"DM: Over bits of a period of discussion, for the most part, any sort of non-official courier service has been negated in the town. However, there is now a glut of people that are, after the devastation, especially the ensuing rebellion, folks that need work and need coin and there are many individuals that would be more than willing to, for a handful of gold coins, make the journey to Emon delivering any messages you like."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, I will write a message to Gilly and say that they're hurting here. They need trade, all the supplies that he's able to supply and tell him that this town is about to explode and is definitely a good place for his wares.\nLAURA: Are you going to break up with him in the letter too? Are you going to tell him that you're going to break his heart as soon as he writes you back? Is that what's going to happen? I'm sorry, I'm just looking at your letter as you're writing it.\nLIAM: No, because I've been avoiding her as well. I'm avoiding everybody except for Percival, who I've been asking advice from.","response":"DM: Okay. Do you also have the cloak? Did you take the cloak?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I have the cloak, yeah. Yeah, dibs on that.","response":"DM: Fine pickings off the corpses of the two major villains of the previous arc."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes.\nTALIESIN: More corpse picking to do.","response":"DM: Exactly."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What?! You have so many cloaks, though. Why do you need another one?\nSAM: He's opening a cloak factory.\nTALIESIN: Gilmore's Glorious Cloaks.\nSAM: I wanted to do four things.\nTRAVIS: Yeah!\nSAM: One, compose an epic poem to commemorate the rebels rising up against the empire that had kept them down for so long. Sort of a force that had awakened. I call it… Resident Evil. I don't know why. Because they're residents and there was evil. I couldn't come up with another name for it. They're residents of the town and there was an evil. That's all. So, I'm looking for a publisher.","response":"DM: Okay, good. There may be a grand opportunity at the Winter's Crest festival to perform this."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh– gulp.\nLIAM: Disney and Capcom will be calling.\nSAM: I also wanted to make sure that we were using the treasury, coordinating with Percy to open a library for the people to help them rebuild their place, which sounds like Vax is already on. I also commissioned a portrait of myself. I don't know if you– I found a young artisan in town that I paid him some coin to paint me something that could possibly hang in the keep, at Greyskull, in the dining room.","response":"DM: Okay. After asking around for a few days, you manage to discover there is a budding local artist who doesn't really believe in his artwork. He currently works in the stables on the far southwest side of town. But people have seen some of his work and tried to bolster him, so you're sent in his direction and as you get there, you can see him. He's currently in the process of actually cutting through one of his recent works he wasn't happy with and he's violently tearing through it. As you step into the stable, he stops and puts it off to the side. “Sorry, sir, can I help you?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ah, hello. My name is Scanlan Shorthalt. I was the leader of the rebellion that just defeated Lord and Lady Briarwood.","response":"DM: “Oh! The pleasure is mine.” He is now averting his gaze and almost bowing his head like you're royalty. He's very flustered and flushed by the sudden appearance."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I hear you are a budding artist and I am, if nothing else, a supporter of the arts.","response":"DM: “My talents are far unrefined and nowhere near powerful or decent enough for your attentions.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, I believe in you. And I need you for a very important commission. A great good has been done here by the rebels, by the townspeople, with the help of Vox Machina and of course, with the help of Vox Machina's leader, myself. Therefore, I'm here to commission a humble portrait of myself. You may not know him, but there was a folk hero in my town growing up. His name was Fabio. He would frequently pose with windblown hair and an open shirt on a horse. I was thinking something like that, and also I have this figure of Pike. She's a friend of mine. I'd like her on the back of the horse, arms around my waist, looking super hot. If that's possible.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check. Only because he's so down on his own skills."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 33.","response":"DM: As you're telling this tale, he goes from bashful and meek to staring off in the distance, the artistic inspiration rolling through his head."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh. Sorry, 31. I was wrong.","response":"DM: Unchanged. He begins finishing your sentences as you're describing scenery and extrapolating on it. You can see the artistic mind is definitely spinning. He looks to you and goes, “It would be my honor. Please.” He reaches forward and takes your gnomish hand and you know, you're about two and a half feet shorter than him, but he's still very humble, kneels down and says, “I would be honored to do this portrait. No charge.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Please, I insist. I must give you something for your troubles.","response":"DM: “Whatever you deem fit, Sir Gnome, but I–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What's your name, young sir?","response":"DM: “Jameson.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Jameson?\nLIAM: I like him.\nSAM: I like this guy.\nTRAVIS: I think everybody does– until they don't.\nSAM: How about in return, I will sing your praises far and wide as the greatest artist in– where are we? Whitestone. Whiteheart. Briarstone. Heartwood.","response":"DM: In making that mention, his openness suddenly closes off and he withdraws. You see this fear in his eyes and he shakes his head. “That would be untrue and I am but a simple stablehand. I can do this for you, but please, if you could keep this between us.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: How big is the wall at Greystone Keep?","response":"DM: Depends on which area."}
{"prompt":"SAM: The dining room wall.","response":"DM: Your dining area's probably about 12 to 15 feet high."}
{"prompt":"SAM: High? Okay, and wide?","response":"DM: Wide? I'd say, off the top of my head, somewhere between 40 and 50 feet."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, I'd like to leave room for other artwork, as well. We'll say 20 by six.\nSAM: Well, it's half and half. 20 wide, six high.","response":"DM: His eyes go wide and he nods and says, “This is a challenge. But I believe I do know someone whom I can order such a grand canvas from. This can be done. This can be done.” And you see he smiles and takes your hand once again. “This can be done.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thank you, sir. Jameson, was it?","response":"DM: “Jameson, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You have done a noble deed for your people and for the rebel forces.","response":"DM: “Eclipsed by the deeds you have done, Sir Gnome.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, that is true.","response":"DM: He rushes off to prepare himself."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And then, one last thing. On a serious note, I do some research to see if me, or any one of my party could, over time and with great effort, learn the skills required to utilize a teleportation circle.","response":"DM: Okay, go ahead and make an arcana check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Not great. Arcana? 11.","response":"DM: Yeah. What little you know of teleportation-based magics, which is not your forte in your bardic experiences, but what you've heard and what you've seen, while you've traveled with Tiberius, and you've come across other individuals that used the arcane spells that caused transport, teleportation circles themselves are a very specific ritual. It's a spell that comes from within the arcane caster's capabilities. If you yourself do not have that, you're not going to be able to utilize it at a drop of a hat. After asking around, you find there once was a teleportation destination circle in Castle Whitestone that was part of the network of Tal'Dorei, in Emon, but has since been destroyed and sundered and has been for quite some time. You imagine probably when the Briarwoods came, it was deemed a dangerous little loose thread. So, over the period of the next week or so, best you can ascertain is that type of transportation here is going to be probably not likely, at least not with the resources you have at your disposal. You may have to travel elsewhere."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's not a skill I can learn?","response":"DM: It's a spell you could learn, but that would be something you would have to swap out as you level up or choose as your spell progression down the road."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I find it's better to travel the world rather than use fast travel.\nLAURA: I agree. You see so much more of it.\nLIAM: You miss everything.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nMARISHA: All the artistic–\nLIAM: Every nook and cranny, yeah.","response":"DM: But you do, as part of your group's discussions throughout the week, discover that Keyleth does have long-transport capabilities."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ooh, hello Keyleth. Fly the friendly skies.","response":"DM: You want to explain what you can do?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I have Teleport via Plants. So I can bamf through the Sun Tree. We can all–\nSAM: We can all?\nMARISHA: We can all.\nLIAM: You mean like a big plant?","response":"DM: It opens for six seconds, a portal–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: For one round, I can be like, this tree is a portal and we walk through the tree and it goes to another tree as long as I know of that tree's existence.\nLAURA: And it's the same size, right? It has to be something of the same size? Or it can be any tree?\nMARISHA: It has to be walkable body-size.","response":"DM: A large or larger tree as far as this size."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket and Grog-sized trees.\nSAM: That sounds like it would be the quickest “root” to go.\nTALIESIN: (groans)\nLIAM: Is there a tree in your garden back at Greyskull?\nMARISHA: There is. I made sure there was a nice–\nLAURA: Big old fatty tree.\nMARISHA: Big old fatty oak tree.","response":"DM: There's actually two large trees, I believe, in the Sarenrae temple."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I forgot to say what else I wanted to do.","response":"DM: What else do you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, because of that flying potion, I wanted to try to do some research and see how much flying potions are, if there's any kind of items that can make you fly whenever you want?\nTRAVIS: She liked it.\nLAURA: I really liked it.\nLAURA: I know. I mean, I know the carpet's gone, but maybe there's like an individual sort of item that's less expensive than a flying carpet, I don't know. Just wondering.","response":"DM: You still have the flying potion–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I downed it!","response":"DM: Right, the card I gave you for it. Because that would contain the cost of that particular one."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh.\nTRAVIS: 5,250.\nLIAM: You have a robe.\nLAURA: Well, but I want a bunch of them, though.","response":"DM: Which you can have made or possibly look about to have purchased. This town is pretty thin as far as–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Magic stuff?","response":"DM: Yeah. Most of anything of worth, of an arcane nature was confiscated and utilized or essentially melted down for its residuum components as part of the creation of the ziggurat, in preparation for their ritual. So, other than the items you were given when you first arrived here, you're hard-pressed to find anything in this town of that type. But asking around, there are enchantments that can gift flight, but they're pretty rare."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nLIAM: Talk to Gilmore.","response":"DM: Gilmore would be the person to talk to about that. You good, Scanlan?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I'm good.\nMARISHA: Well, Keyleth is very confused as to why everyone seems to be avoiding each other. It's odd. Everyone's so standoffish. Anyway, Keyleth is going to go help the farmers and try and maybe help revitalize some of the land and help with planting crops, and helping out there. She also wants to make sure all the local kids are taken care of. Any kids that lost their parents in the rebellion. Lead the charge of making sure the kids are taken care of.","response":"DM: Okay. Going around, there were a number of casualties in the town as part of the rebellion. It unfortunately happens in warfare, regardless of how noble a cause it may be. There are a few families that were left fatherless or motherless, as there was quite a share of the sexes raising up for this battle. So the children that– no one that you know of lost both parents, for the most part. There was the intent that if there were a parental unit, that at least one had to stay in case of such an occurrence to raise the children. But you go out and meet with some of the families and make sure they're taken care of. Some of the homes that were destroyed as part of the rebellion, you and Grog both worked together to help make sure the process of rebuilding goes well. You do also help the farmers begin to right their crops and revitalize the land, which had been drained by the necromantic essence of the Briarwoods' presence, and whatever the ziggurat was pulling from the land itself beneath seems to have released its hold on the immediate vicinity. So, through your aid specifically, being a druid of your nature, you prepare this for probably one of the finest harvests that Whitestone has had in quite a long time. Even though it is deep winter, they're already seeing early spring growth through your aid."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Dope. Climate change.","response":"DM: I know, it's crazy. Vegetation and vegetables that are withstanding and still able to grow through the frost in the mornings, as the cold weather is coming from the winter, so you're raising quite a strong crop. Well done."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We'll have Thanksgiving in about nine months.\nTALIESIN: For the orphans, man.\nMARISHA: For the orphans.","response":"DM: Percival?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to spend most of my time organizing the affairs of the castle and the local government and making sure that there's institutions in place, getting rid of anybody who might still have sympathies towards the Briarwoods. Helping re-establish the Zenith and the Ladies' Chamber. Spending some time with my sister.\nSAM: Archibald's still around?","response":"DM: He is."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And he betrayed us?\nLAURA and MARISHA: No.\nLAURA: Cassandra betrayed him.\nLIAM: Cassandra played everybody.\nLAURA: Thank you, glorious leader. Thank you.\nSAM: Just part of the team, guys.","response":"DM: So that is an ongoing discussion. As far as establishing the structure, there's been many talks, but nothing has been fine-tuned, and that may play itself out as part of the festival."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I have two items that I would like to look at. Well, I have three items that I would like to look at. Sylas's sword and his amulet.","response":"DM: Travis has got you."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Really, Travis?\nLAURA: He's our runner.\nLIAM: Oh, ho ho ho, and all of that!\nLAURA: What is it?\nMARISHA: What is it, what is it?\nTALIESIN: Damn.\nLAURA: Is it amazing?\nLIAM: He's standing there like Guile before a Street Fighter match.","response":"DM: He hasn't heard of that character."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is the worst thing for you.\nLAURA: Not anymore!\nTALIESIN: Is it?\nLIAM: I'm unsure. It's hard to tell.","response":"DM: You gather that this item in particular was used by Sylas to travel through magically protected areas without giving up his undead essence or being read for his true intentions."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's for a shifty bastard. It's definitely a shifty bastard thing.\nLAURA: It's for Scanlan.\nSAM: Oh, me? My alignment's good.\nMARISHA: Yeah, but it could be good if you want to pretend to be evil.\nTALIESIN: Either this or Vax. This would be an interesting thing for either–\nMARISHA: It doesn't protect you against Detect Magic spells. It protects you against Detect Good or Evil spells and magic spells that reveal your true nature.\nSAM: True nature.\nLIAM: It would be a good thing.\nLAURA: So you could pretend to be bad.","response":"DM: It's in the neck slot."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Nothing.\nTALIESIN: Nothing in your neck slot?\nLAURA: That sounds so disgusting.\nTALIESIN: Don't say that!","response":"DM: I know. Percy, what else?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: The sword.","response":"DM: The sword."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That is a big piece of paper.\nLIAM: That's a rather big piece of paper for a sword.\nTALIESIN: And Ripley's gun.","response":"DM: Well, first, as you take the sword in your hands, the large, thick obsidian, onyx black blade. You take a while to, not necessarily attune to it, but put enough of your attention towards it where you sense its magical capabilities. As it begins to clarify, where one voice before was not there, a new voice speaks and says–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait!\nLIAM: (shushing noises) This is important.\nTALIESIN: Goddamn it.","response":"DM: “You, are you my new wielder?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What?\nSAM: He's got a talking sword!\nMARISHA: What's with you and fucking weapons, man?\nTALIESIN: (whimpers)\nLAURA: Be strong, Percy!\nLIAM: You're not here.\nTALIESIN: No.","response":"DM: “Then leave me until one worthy lifts this blade.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to gently put it down.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: This is a sword that has a name!","response":"DM: As you step away from the blade, you can feel the air nearby is generally colder in its presence, and where previously it was just a weapon, you can almost feel like there's something looking at you. There's a presence just bent towards you, expectantly."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's creepy!\nTALIESIN: (whimpers)\nSAM: Just try it out! What could go wrong?\nLIAM: Do you want to become evil, Grog?\nTRAVIS: I can tame it.\nLIAM: Don't do it, Percy.\nTRAVIS: What does it say?\nLAURA and SAM: What does it say?\nTALIESIN: I don't think I should tell any of you.","response":"DM: The blade sits there on the ground where you leave it, whatever you wish to do with it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you want to put it in the Bag?\nTALIESIN: God, you've given me so much to think about. It's really unfortunate. I'm definitely going to take at least a week of our two weeks to think about the sword.","response":"DM: Okay. What are you going to do with it in the meantime?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sleep on top of it.\nTALIESIN: Sleep on top of it. It's in my room.\nTRAVIS: You don't want it in the Bag?\nTALIESIN: No.","response":"DM: So, for each evening as you lay down to sleep, you can feel a voice creep back in to say– The voice is inquisitive. “I'm useless left here. I seek the thrill of battle. I'm hungry.” Other evenings, it comes to you, almost pleading. “Why have you forsaken me? You took me as a trophy. What purpose has a blade that goes unused? I will remember this.” Then it falls silent after a few days."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The silent treatment.\nLAURA: It's sulking.\nTALIESIN: Is it a two-handed sword or a one-handed sword?","response":"DM: It's a greatsword. It's two-handed, big old Final Fantasy 7 sword."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Goddamn it.\nSAM: Evil Grog is not a good idea.\nMARISHA: This is the thing that's fucked up.\nLIAM: You can certainly try.\nTALIESIN: God damn it.","response":"DM: So, as you think on it, the weeks pass–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, I had a–","response":"DM: Oh, what did you guys want to do?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I also wanted to work on Ripley's gun.","response":"DM: Right. The gun itself is essentially a baseline pistol. If you look in your archetype for your fighter class of gunslinger, the pistol mechanics all apply to that weapon. Beyond that, nothing in particular. It's just her first successful attempt in recreating a firearm."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to start making some ammo for it. And I'm going to work on it.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Percy, whenever you get a chance, could you, maybe– how hard are those exploding arrows to make? Super-duper hard?\nTALIESIN: Not terribly difficult. I don't think it's in two weeks, but when we go home, I'll work on it. I know, I like them too… I hate you. You're a terrible person.","response":"DM: You picked up the sword, man."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Percy, how's that sword working out?\nTALIESIN: It's a little big, actually.\nTRAVIS: Is it? Look, I have this one-handed Dragonslayer Longsword if you want to get used to a bit of badassery before you move up to the big leagues. I know you've got that dinky piece of shit you've been using this whole time.","response":"DM: Just as a note, too, a greatsword is a strength-based melee weapon. Dex does not play into it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, which is– well, yeah.","response":"DM: Based on whatever your strength is. What's your strength, Percy?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Strength is 12.","response":"DM: You would probably not do very well with that."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Which is why I was thinking about having it cut down and melted down into something more useful.","response":"DM: This is also viable, if you wanted to try."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (whispering) Dragon-slayer Longsword.\nTALIESIN: You know, this is actually pretty badass if I did give it to Grog. Yeah.\nTRAVIS: Trade!\nMARISHA: Jesus Christ! And he's not even going to say anything about it. You're a terrible person, not Matt, you are. He gave you the device and you used it!\nLIAM: You've been playing D&D for years. You know what this means!\nTALIESIN: I'm going to let you know we should keep an eye on him, just in case.","response":"DM: So, Grog. As you take up the blade in your hands, you hear coming out of the ether, a gentle, low velvet voice caresses the inside of your head saying, “You, are you to be my wielder?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What the shit?","response":"DM: “Speak your name, warrior.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Grog.","response":"DM: “Warrior Grog, have you taken up the blade of Craven Edge?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Is that what this is? Do you have a female setting?","response":"DM: You hear a long, drawn-out sigh. “Do you accept my power?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: There's a power that comes with you? What kind of power?","response":"DM: “Do you enjoy drinking the strength of your foes, watching them beaten before you, and have that very power become your own?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Sounds pretty good.","response":"DM: “Do you wish the shadows to encase your form and grant you resilience and anger, forcing those to kneel before you in fear.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The shadows?","response":"DM: “Do you accept, Grog?”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.","response":"DM: “Then it is done. Together, we will accomplish great things.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you have a name? Do I call upon you? Can I call you Bacon?","response":"DM: “You call me Bacon and this blade will cut the very hand you hold. My name is Craven Edge. It will do you well to remember that.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right. Yep. Was totally kidding about the bacon, Craven Edge. Well, I'm excited about this partnership. Clearly we will be a force to be reckoned with. By the way, can other people hear you?","response":"DM: Silence."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Shit.\nLIAM: He will kill me first.\nTALIESIN: It is an amazing sword.\nTRAVIS: I haven't even read it yet.\nTALIESIN: You haven't read it yet?\nTRAVIS: No. I can't read!\nLAURA: I want to read it so bad!\nLIAM: Don't let anybody read it.\nTALIESIN: It's so magical.\nTRAVIS: Give me a bear cookie.","response":"DM: You have a clue as to what it can do based on when it was used against you by Sylas."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, it was badass. Thank you.","response":"DM: So, anything else you want to accomplish before we close out on the rest of the week?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I had a question.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Did we assemble a team of magic–\nLAURA: To take care of the thingy?\nMARISHA: Yeah, that we needed to– we all need to take care of that.\nLAURA: The marble of death?","response":"DM: So, throughout the week, Keeper Yennen, a few of the low-level arcanists that exist here–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Didn't we send for Eskil Ryndarien?","response":"DM: You sent for him, but you know information right now travels at the speed of whatever it is you–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: By mule?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: At speed of mule.","response":"DM: The speed of that as it continues forward. You get word back. Nothing from Allura Vysoren yet. Eskil does respond, saying he is currently finishing up some personal business, but will make his way towards Whitestone within a couple weeks, with some of his compatriots who may also be of aid. Information has been gotten across, but it won't be until probably after this festival for them to begin their investigation. However, in the meantime, Keeper Yennen and a few of the smaller local arcanists do make a couple trips down to inspect the ziggurat themselves. When they return, Yennen is at a loss. Most of them don't quite understand the nature of the magic there. It seems to be immobile. It seems to be completely either negating, consuming, or preventing any sort of magical force within a specific radius of it. A lot of their normal arcane methods of inspecting or divine methods of inspecting this site are not functional. This is more like bring old tomes and research historical records of things that may be similar to this. So when you bring up that you had reached out to Eskil Ryndarien with the information you had, you gather that will probably be a much more fruitful endeavor. As of right now, no one has any clue what this is."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And we searched the Briarwoods' library that they had gathered together that say anything about–","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nLAURA: Be on the lookout for eggs, giant frosty-looking eggs.","response":"DM: You make your way towards the Sun Tree and there you see Keeper Yennen is in the process of speaking with a few of the people that helped him with this entire rebellion, in setting up this event, and he greets you all as you approach. “Oh, my friends! How wondrous. Glad to see you are all wakened and ready and well rested, I assume.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes.","response":"DM: “Glorious. Well, this is a day of celebration. We've taken the time and mourning shall continue as needed, but today, today is to embrace what it means to be alive, to thwart the darkness and the evils that press upon the free folk of these lands. And of course, to eat and drink until you are full and drunk.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I haven't eaten for a full day.\nMARISHA: In preparation?\nTRAVIS: Yep.","response":"DM: You do see what looks to be a gentleman with a high box, with a very, very fine waxed mustache that is currently doing parlor tricks and magical presentations for people who are trading coin to be astounded with his illusions. You can see what looks to be a series of tables behind the Sun Tree heading towards the southeast side of it. You recognize better than anyone: these are central tables, relatively small, with a chair on each side."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Arm wrestling!\nTRAVIS: Craven, I think– oh wait, that's arm wrestling. Go to sleep.","response":"DM: The sigh is getting more and more impatient."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He'll get used to that.","response":"DM: So these are the three first events you come across in your immediate vicinity. What would any of you guys like to partake in?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I see the magic tricks and go (loud gasp) and run over, without saying anything.\nSAM: I tag along.\nTALIESIN: Oh, I'll go in for this one as well.\nMARISHA: Okay.","response":"DM: As you guys rush forward, you come to the box. It's a relatively high box. It looks like it hasn't seen some use in a while. The gentleman sitting there, with longish hair, parted in the center, and combs outward. He's got a waxed mustache. He's wearing dusty presentational robes and he has on the top of it a series of small boxes and what looks like various tricks he has at the ready. There are three children off to the side with either their keeper or parents behind. “Now watch, if you will, as this simple ball transports itself between the cups and yet find your eyes unable to follow.” And he switches the cups around for a moment. (whoosh)"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (gasps), are you a wizard? We've met a few wizards. No, are you a sorcerer? Because you don't look like a druid. This doesn't look like natural magic. What?","response":"DM: “I am what you refer to as an illusionist. And I can play tricks on your mind, your mind, your mind…”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (shouting) No! God, we've been through way too much of that here lately.\nSAM: It's entertainment.","response":"DM: “Playful! Playful illusions, not against…”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's just a game.\nTALIESIN: Carry on. It's good. She's good.","response":"DM: “Keep her in check, please. You're scaring the children.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's not real. It's a game. It's going to be fine.\nMARISHA: (whispers) Okay. I don't trust this guy.\nSAM: Don't worry. Why don't you have Percival take the first turn?","response":"DM: “I'm also a diviner. I can look into your eyes and see your very future.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Not really. It's okay.","response":"DM: “For a simple gold piece, you can test your skills against the transference of this ethereal ball. Or for five, I can look into your fate.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (starts hyperventilating)\nTALIESIN: I'll do both, actually.\nMARISHA: I grab him by the scruff and I say, if you hurt him… You don't know what he's been through, okay?\nMARISHA: Are you working with the Briarwoods? Did the Briarwoods send you?!","response":"DM: “Can you please get her off of me?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hey, kids, this is why you shouldn't drink during the daytime.","response":"DM: “Anyway.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do your magic.\nMARISHA: Oh, him? Okay.\nTALIESIN: 20.","response":"DM: You see now, there's a couple moments where the ball shifts between cups and you get a really close idea of exactly how this works. And when he finishes, he looks to you. “Now, where is the fey ball?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I would say it's to your right, right there.","response":"DM: “That one?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It could, but it's there. Because it's not anywhere else other than there.\nSAM: I'm not so sure about that, Percy.\nTALIESIN: Well, you're welcome to go in, if you like.\nSAM: I choose the one on the left.\nTALIESIN: You'll have to give him a gold coin, though.\nSAM: Sure. (ding)","response":"DM: He takes the gold coin. “Do you wish to choose for this one instead, then?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, I'm choosing on the right.","response":"DM: Takes the gold piece. “And with that– \"You found it, yay.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I lean into Percy and I say: this guy's not a threat. He's okay.\nTALIESIN: Well, I am a dark evil demonic creature.","response":"DM: As he gives you the five gold, he immediately takes it back. “But you wanted to know your fate.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: “Step forward, young– what's your name?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Just Percy.","response":"DM: “Percy. Please, present your face.” As he reaches out, he begins to feel the bumps on your head. He begins to touch the outside of your face. He closes his eyes. “Yes, yes, I can see into the very nature of your existence. You, young– Percy?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: “Percy, Percy. Young Percy. You, you have hardworking hands, you've seen a lifetime of hard, hard work in the fields. But you wish to make your father proud, as does every son and you will– as one day you will become… a well celebrated smith of horseshoes! Yes! Glory to Percy!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Amazing! So accurate.\nTALIESIN: So accurate.","response":"DM: He leans in and says, “I could tell from the black powder on your hands that you've worked with a few pieces of iron in your time.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Very astute.","response":"DM: (chuckles) “Thank you so much. So, who's next?” The children start rushing up and– you guys wish to continue with this guy?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No.\nMARISHA: I've seen enough.","response":"DM: Okay, who's doing what now?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Does anyone want to get down to the pie contest? I thought I might arm wrestle first.\nLIAM: I think you should arm wrestle.\nSAM: Oh yeah, I want to see this.\nTRAVIS: I'd like to arm wrestle, in case I need to eat my way out of sadness with pies.\nTALIESIN: Turn your sadness into victory.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nSAM: I will also enter the arm wrestling competition.\nTRAVIS: Yes!","response":"DM: Okay, okay. So, as you guys step up, you can see there's a woman dressed in a rather simple barmaid outfit, leather apron on her side and she's pretty thick and rough-and-tumble with her timbre. She has her hair pulled up in a very tight bun in the back. She has a bit of a smudge on her chin. She says, “All who wish to enter the contest please step right here, pay your entry fee! Graciously prove your might and your strength. Show that you yourself are responsible for the rebellion succeeding.” Sees you. “You! You wish to be part of this, yes!”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, I do!","response":"DM: “Very well, very well. Ah, entry fee–” She leans in and gets real for a second. “Entry fee is 25 gold pieces each. Winner gets free drinks and the pot.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I slap down 25 gold on behalf of Grog.\nTRAVIS: (excited gasp)\nSAM: You're paying for his entry?\nLIAM: I'm paying for his entry, sure.\nSAM: And mine, as well?\nLIAM: No.\nTRAVIS: Good man.\nSAM: I would like to– I would also like to compete.","response":"DM: (prolonged high-pitched giggle) “Sorry. 25 gold then.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Here you go.","response":"DM: “I mean no offense, I just– it's a cute beret.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The other goliath!","response":"DM: Goran Vedmire, who you've seen–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The Duke!","response":"DM: Yeah, no longer Duke. Un-Duked."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Once you Duke something, you can't un-Duke it, Matt.","response":"DM: No, he's been thoroughly un-Duked, trust me."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The Duke that was formerly known as–\nTRAVIS: Duke Gonad.\nSAM: That's me!\nTRAVIS: Yay, Scanlan!\nMARISHA: Yes, Scanlan!","response":"DM: As you're getting ready, you see a farmer-type individual. Clean, as dressed as he could be in relatively ragged clothes, but he looks like he's trying to be presentory for the festival. Grey beard, longish shoulder-length tousled hair. He walks up, pulling his wrist back, and he's got some good muscles. Looks like he's definitely been working a lot of heavy farmwork for most of his life. He sits down at the table across from you, gives you a look over. “Well, shall we begin?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Sure. Can I ever-so-covertly say to him, you don't want to beat a gnome. You don't want to beat a gnome. I'm casting Suggestion on him.","response":"DM: I will say, go ahead and make a sleight-of-hand check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, the worst. Shit. 13.\nLAURA: What does it mean? The eyebrows!\nTRAVIS: And the phone came out.\nSAM: Who knows? We'll find out when my arm gets wrenched off.\nLAURA: Looking at Jasper's stats, I can tell.","response":"DM: No, what are you talking about?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: He's checking Twitter.\nSAM: Yes, sir.\nSAM: 19.","response":"DM: You guys stand there for a second (groans) his arm begins to push on yours, begins to bend back a little bit, you reflex with might and begin to set him back up to the center. You've reached a standstill, once again, back at the center. His expression on his face looks frustrated and surprised."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You weren't expecting this, were you? (pants) Neither was I!","response":"DM: Make another strength check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Not as good. 11.","response":"DM: 11. At this point, as you say that, he tenses and forces down your hand now, right at three-quarters to the table. Make another strength check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Come on, Scanlan!\nSAM: 16!","response":"DM: 16. (groans) About to touch the knuckles–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What is going on? I had– This has never happened before.","response":"DM: He's keeping his hand to his side, trying not to grasp the edge of the table, which is technically against the rules. He's looking around at everyone watching and realizes the sheer amount of attention that's put on the fact that this tiny little gnome is now keeping him at a standstill."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I shout out from the crowd, Scanlan! Pike is here! She's astral-projected in!\nSAM: Natural one.\nSAM: You idiot!\nLIAM: All the blood rushed somewhere else, that's not my fault.\nSAM: I had him! (groans)\nSAM: I don't need your pity! Grog, kick this motherfucker's ass!","response":"DM: Two more events go by, two more gentlemen have a showdown– actually no, it's a woman and a man. The woman is a pretty tough-looking warrior, probably one of the guards of Castle Whitestone. She's still in partial armor, has been guarding the event, has taken her helmet off to be part of this event, taking a moment to relax. She goes up against another merchant of the town and just destroys him. The next bout is a man who, the way he's dressed, appears to be a blacksmith. He  still has his leather gauntlets on, he takes them off at the table, takes off his leather apron and sets it to the side. Gets down and ready and looks around for his opponent and the two guards bring up the chained Vedmire, who then sits down at the table, the chains hitting against the sides of the wooden table top and coasting to the ground as they adjust. He puts his arm on the table with a thud, and has to bend over to even reach the other guy's grasp. You can see the look on his face immediately pale as he realizes who he's up against. It's two rounds and maybe 20 seconds tops before Vedmire slams him so hard you can part of the tabletop splinters inward and the guy brings his hand back with bleeding knuckles. He reaches over, puts his hand out expectantly. The barmaid hands him a tankard full of ale. He downs it in one gulp, slams it on the table and stands back up again. He glances over at you and steps back into the crowd. The second round of the events go in. You are paired up with the gentleman who defeated Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Kick his ass, Grog!\nTALIESIN: Yeah!\nSAM: Put him in a body bag!\nTRAVIS: I sit down and I say, I feel really bad for you mate. You know, my friend? He's got hand herpes… So do I.\nSAM: It's true.","response":"DM: Make a deception roll."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 20! 19 plus one!","response":"DM: Natural one on his part. He looks genuinely frightened and is about to back up and get the attention of the barmaid who's running this event and he sees the crowd around."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I mean, you're a farmer, right? You handle food.","response":"DM: He spits in his hand, puts it out and grabs your hand. The barmaid once again. “And– prove your strength!” Roll a strength check. He has disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 21.","response":"DM: Natural one. He's already straining and the back of his knuckles are immediately up against the wood. You can see fear in his eyes and he's gripping, but he's also trying to move his fingers to make sure he doesn't make too much contact with your hand. Go ahead and roll another strength check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 11.","response":"DM: At which point, he sees the grin on your face and gets his will back behind him and (grunts) forces you back to the center. Make another strength check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Seven.","response":"DM: Natural 20."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: He (groans) slams you right over on the edge of the table. Make another check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Come on, Grog!\nTRAVIS: 23.","response":"DM: 19. Back up to the center, at a standstill. You see now the veins bulging at his neck, you can see now, his face is turning red from the strain. He's breathing heavily (pants) as he pushes again. Make another strength check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Come on, Grog!\nTRAVIS: Eight.","response":"DM: (chuckles) Eight. (groans) Keeping you right in the middle. Make another check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I hold up my hand and I use Minor Illusion to make it all dotted with herpes.\nTRAVIS: 17.\nTRAVIS: It's slippery when the pores start to seep. That's a one.\nSAM: No!\nTALIESIN: No!","response":"DM: With a disadvantage, he gets a two. You guys are at the middle again."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my god.","response":"DM: Big struggle."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 22.","response":"DM: With disadvantage again, because of that– though disadvantage is fading at this point. He got a 12. So yeah (groans), now he's back down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Come on Grog, finish it!\nTRAVIS: 22.","response":"DM: He got a seven. He looks at you, looks at the hand, looks at you again and you can see in his face, the sudden look of acceptance as you stop playing with him and (whack) slam it really hard on the wood. You can see, he pulls away… (gasps) “Wash it! Wash it, please! Wash it, somebody wash it!”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You know, the cure for that is actually on my man Vax's groin. It's very magical.\nTRAVIS: I look at Gonad over at the side. I drink it, chug it down, and hold up the finger at the same time.\nLIAM: I've spent the last ten minutes while he's kicking that guy's ass to find a soldier or somebody in the crowd to bet.\nSAM: A young boy?\nLIAM: I'm not you.\nLIAM: 200 gold on Grog. Somebody in the crowd.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 14.","response":"DM: Going around, you're hard-pressed to find somebody who at this moment in time is interested in betting any money against the goliath that helped save the city. You find one gentleman who seems a little interested and he gives you this sidelong, sleazy grin. “Tell you what, not 200 gold, but I'll put 50 down.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's not worth it. 75 gold?","response":"DM: “Step away, halfie.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! I heard it. I give him the evil eye.","response":"DM: He's too focused on the current bout at hand. At this table, you can now see Vedmire and the woman guard sits down. Someone's like, “Oh, Trisha's wrestling.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Her name's Trisha? Trish the Dish.","response":"DM: Vedmire, again with his chains against the wood as he sits down with a smile. He gives her a grin and nod. She's just– intensity towards him the whole time. You can see there's a little bit of intensity to win, but you also see spite in that look. You see that she knows what he's done and this victory means more to her than otherwise. The two of them– first match, she pushes and gets the upper hand. A three-quarter view perspective, she's tensing herself, you hear the muscle tensing beneath the armor itself, the metal creaking as her whole upper torso begins to push into it. She begins to push it back–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah! Trish the Dish!\nALL: Trish the Dish! Trish the Dish!\nTRAVIS: Well, get used to disappointment, shithead.","response":"DM: At which point, his chains are tightened and the guards lift him up again off of his seat and he gets led off back into the crowd."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, walk away, you beardless bastard.","response":"DM: As everyone gathers in now, you can now see more discussions and people are starting to really place bets down now on the outcome of this circumstance. The barmaid comes up again. “You, champion Grog, sit down. And you, champion Trisha, sit down. As the final round of this show of majestic might happens now. Hands clasped, please.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: If I may, thank you for your service to this city. That last round was a true pleasure to watch.","response":"DM: Her face goes from hardened to soft for a minute as she reaches out and clasps you, not hand in hand, but forearm to forearm, and gives you a solid shake. “I've done so little. You've done far more. But we all must do our part to keep the city safe.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Aye.","response":"DM: “But right now, I'm going to have to destroy you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I kind of love Trish the Dish.\nMARISHA: I know, I like her, too.","response":"DM: Her clasp on your forearm slides back, keeping your hand. Both of you tense muscles, we're talking Predator vs. Schwarzenegger."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (Schwarzenegger accent) Yah, what's the matter, Dylan? You guys ate too many pretzels?\nMARISHA: She's one of us.","response":"DM: “For the final round, let this show of might begin!” Strength check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Eight.","response":"DM: As the moment of tension hits, you can sense there's definitely a balance, both of you are keeping at bay. She cocks her head curiously and forces you down to the three-quarter back position. Go ahead and make another strength check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Come on, Grog! Oh my god.\nTRAVIS: Six.\nLIAM: It's that sword's influence.","response":"DM: She brings you right down to the edge of the table and you can see in her face, there's this genuine look of surprise, like she probably could have finished you, but she feels like there's a trick or there's something to it that she can't be beating you this easy."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm so surprised by what's happening. I use Intimidating Presence on her.\nMARISHA: Oh shit.\nTRAVIS: Fuck.","response":"DM: Does this have to be during a rage?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 12. I'll go into a rage for it.\nTRAVIS: I was hoping I wouldn't need it!","response":"DM: No, you don't have to be in a rage for it, but you can choose to, if you want."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: it doesn't add anything to my strength roll, right?","response":"DM: A 12 for intimidation? Well, what do you want to do to try and intimidate her? She's about to finish you off on this table."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'm like, oh! (grunts) and I bite down on my tongue and blood just starts to pour out of the corner of my mouth.\nLAURA: Oh, gross!","response":"DM: She sees this, and her eyes go wide for a second. She pulls back and for a brief moment, you feel her grip loosen ever so slightly. Go ahead and make the next strength check with advantage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The other one was a one.","response":"DM: Well, I'm glad you had advantage on that; she rolled a five. So you do manage to (groans) force her back up. You're still in a bad place, but you manage to pull out of that circle and you can see now her intensity hits and she realizes she's not going to go soft on you at all going forward. But as the blood pools down your chin, you can feel the iron-y taste swishing around in your mouth and you can see there's a little bit of a quiver to her. She's still spooked by this whole circumstance, but she's trying her best. Go ahead and make another strength check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: She's battle-worn. 19.\nLAURA: That's good!","response":"DM: That's good. She has disadvantage on these because of the fright. I'm giving her that, but even still, she still rolls a 17. What did you roll, total?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 19.","response":"DM: 19. You guys keep it– she's still holding you there, you're not able to gain any ground. You're really impressed by this display she's giving you. Roll again."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do I have advantage? No.","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 12.","response":"DM: 12? Okay. She forces you back down–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I step forward and I sing a song of inspiration.\nSAM: I sing, (sings) let's go raging now, everybody's learning how, come on on a rampage with me!\nTALIESIN: Come on on a rampage with me!\nTRAVIS: Fine ditties!\nLIAM: Show us your ditties!\nTRAVIS: 16.","response":"DM: 16?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: With the ten inspiration.","response":"DM: With the ten? Okay. It's good you did that. You force her back up, she starts like, really pushing into it and you can see now the sweat's dripping off of her brow, her eyes are quivering. Make another check. How long does that last?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Seven.","response":"DM: Seven. Hold on."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You should switch.\nSAM: Grog, what are you doing?!\nSAM: Oh my god, do you really have hand herpes?","response":"DM: What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Seven.","response":"DM: Seven. Yeah, she still beats you. So, at this point, you're pushed down. She gives you this look–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: This is unreal.","response":"DM: Yeah. Of intense anger– and her face softens and she gives you a nod of respect. (thud) Releases her grip and pulls away, holds her arms up, crowd goes wild. The drink is slammed in front of her, the ale swishing and spilling over the side. She takes it in one hand and slides it forward and hands it to you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Aw, she's a good lady.\nTRAVIS: You are a true warrior and I hope you'll continue to protect this city with that strength.","response":"DM: “I intend to.” She gives you a nod, walks around, accepts her coin purse and steps back into the rest of the celebration."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I walk away (coughs), coughing (coughs), trying not to cry. (coughs) I take my tankard and splash it on my face. Oh, it's just ale. It's just ale. (sobs)\nSAM: It's okay, Grog. Let's go get you drunk.","response":"DM: As this is happening, a courier comes up dressed in colors that are reminiscent of the courier service that travels through Emon, through Westruun. There's a certain type of overcoat they wear that gives you the inclination that they've traveled from nearby civilization. Steps up with a rolled up sequence of letters and a small box that is wrapped up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh look, the young boy you ordered, Scanlan.","response":"DM: He's in his mid-20s."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm Percival.","response":"DM: “You're Percival?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: “I'm to deliver this to you.” He hands you the small box. “I have here two small letters.” And hands them over both to you. There's a small, thin one that is actually written to Percival, and there's one addressed to Vox Machina."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I was going to sit here and watch you roll them.\nMARISHA: Presentation's lost.","response":"DM: That's fine."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I just noticed Taliesin's outfit, by the way.\nLAURA: We were supposed to wear pajamas.\nTALIESIN: I wore my pajamas. My muppet pajamas.","response":"DM: Yeah, the week got busy and we forgot."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You don't want me in my pajamas because they're–","response":"DM: That one's to you and the other one's to Vox Machina."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (sings) Letters, we've got letters.\nTALIESIN: Oh, this is quite interesting. “Vox Machina, a little bird tells me you have been playing the heroes again. Keep this up, and the whole world will end up indebted to you. Please accept this small gift in the spirit of Winter's Crest, as a token of my enduring gratitude. Perhaps it will prove useful in a difficult moment. In the meantime, I look forward to a fuller account of your deeds reaching us in Vasselheim. A joyous Crest to you all. It seems you have earned it. Lillith.”\nLAURA: Oh!\nTALIESIN: “P.S., Zahra sends her greetings.”\nSAM: (dreamily) Zahra.\nMARISHA: The tieflings!\nSAM: We had quite a night together. Just braiding each other's hair.\nTALIESIN: I tuck the private note away and put it in my pocket.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, there's another one, right?","response":"DM: There is a box, yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, is it big enough to hold a giant carpet?\nTALIESIN: Perhaps a small ice egg.","response":"DM: It's about that big in your hands."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We open the box.","response":"DM: You open the gift. Inside, there are two–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Check it for traps!\nLAURA: Okay.\nTALIESIN: It's been a while since we had a visual aid.","response":"DM: Yeah, it's nice when you have a really good artist, apparently. But two stones like this. They are called Gate Stones."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Gate Stones?","response":"DM: The two stones are essentially linked. One is placed wherever you like and the other is kept with you. A single individual, just an individual, not a group, can take a minute to concentrate on one stone and be instantly transported to where the other stone is, with the stone."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Badass.\nLIAM: One-way ticket.","response":"DM: Essentially, yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You take it with you and you can zoom back to wherever you left it.\nSAM: There are two stones in this box?","response":"DM: Yeah. They are the two that are linked."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A person or linked?","response":"DM: No, there is a single set."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So this is a get out of jail free card.\nSAM: Or a bamf-in-Pike card.","response":"DM: There's multiple situational uses for it, depending. But apparently this has been painstakingly either enchanted, constructed, and sent by Lillith for you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: They're all from Lillith?","response":"DM: Yeah, the letters and those two stones."}
{"prompt":"SAM: From Lillith and Zahra?","response":"DM: And Zahra, both of them, essentially."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, Lillith doesn't have the other stone?\nLIAM: For a little arcane booty call?\nTALIESIN: I don't know what you're talking about.\nTRAVIS: Please?\nTALIESIN: No.\nLAURA: I don't think I've ever seen Percy giggle before.\nTRAVIS: Are you blushing?\nTALIESIN: No. It's cold. Very cold.\nTRAVIS: It's a new demon, isn't it? The blushing demon!\nTALIESIN: She was great, wasn't she?\nSAM: Lillith is a true friend. Zahra, as well.\nTALIESIN: Zahra is great, as well.","response":"DM: You hear murmurs now, people mentioning the pie-eating contest starting soon."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Vex and Vax!\nTRAVIS: Yeah!","response":"DM: Hello! And welcome back. I hope you guys enjoyed your little look into the past of Vox Machina. Once again, thank you to everyone who helped us with that. Huge thanks to Wendy. You were amazing in putting that together for us. It's been a long-time endeavor coming."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We love you, Wendy.\nLAURA: Is Trinket allowed to join in the pie eating contest too?\nLAURA: Oh.\nLIAM: Right here.\nLAURA: And a bear. Is there room for a bear?","response":"DM: “A bear. Like, a bear?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, but a very human-acting bear.","response":"DM: “Oh, sure. Bring him in. No! It's a bear! Two more, room for two more.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you want me to join?\nLIAM: Can someone transmogrify Trinket, quickly?\nLAURA: (gasps) Can you Polymorph Trinket, Keyleth?\nMARISHA: Into what?\nLAURA: A human.\nLIAM: To a hot man.\nTALIESIN: To a lumberjack.\nLAURA: Into a lumberjack of a man?\nMARISHA: I don't think it works that way.\nLAURA: Try it!\nTALIESIN: Old Spice commercial. Make it happen.","response":"DM: You can certainly try."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I try it.\nLIAM: Winter's Crest magic!\nMARISHA: I believe. I believe in the spirit of Winter's Crest.\nLAURA: Can you Polymorph Trinket into a man?\nSAM: Sure.\nLAURA: Scanlan says he can.\nMARISHA: I think Scanlan actually might have a better chance with Seeming?\nSAM: I can Polymorph Trinket.\nMARISHA: But can you Polymorph animals into people?","response":"DM: Technically, you could, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can?","response":"DM: Technically. I don't see why not."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fur, just fur–\nSAM: Furry belly? What is that?\nMARISHA: Like that guy in the beginning of Barbarella.","response":"DM: So you turned your bear into a bear."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Brian Blessed.\nMARISHA: Yes.\nLAURA: Here's my bear, right here.","response":"DM: So you rush off and you come back with Trinket. As you can see, he's walking a little strange and (bear moans) Rolls up and brushes his scruffy man beard against the side of your face. You gather, Polymorph does not affect the intellect of whatever you transform."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I grab a mug of ale and go: another one, right? Yeah! He's had so many!\nLAURA: So drunk, this guy!\nMARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. Grog, do we still have that helmet, that pot that you wore on your head, in the Bag of Holding?\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Can we have that real quick?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, okay. So I reach in and take out the big bronze pot.\nMARISHA: I put the pot on his head.\nLAURA: Why?\nMARISHA: It's special.\nSAM: Oh, he has a helmet head?","response":"DM: So the pot, which covers Trinket's head… (bear moans)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He does not need a pot on his head. Trinket, have a seat in this chair like a normal human.\nTRAVIS: You can give that back to me.\nLAURA: Here you go.\nLIAM: I keep giving him ale.\n[no audio]","response":"DM: “To eat…”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I do not have much confidence. You have always eaten more than me, always.","response":"DM: “Now!” Dive in face first, arms behind you, just tearing through these pies. Just blackberries, strawberries, all forms of berries just being tossed everywhere. There's a couple chicken pies–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No hands, no hands!\nLAURA: Oh, no hands?","response":"DM: No hands, no."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket, no hands.","response":"DM: Trinket goes like, (inquisitive grunt)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No hands! No paws!\nSAM: I'm going to use Message to communicate to Grog: If there was ever a time for a prank, now is it.\nTRAVIS: Oh shit.","response":"DM: As you all tear through your first large pies, smeared across the faces, with your mind off to the side, you glance over, everyone go ahead and make a constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Constitution? Oh, he's going to barf.\nLIAM: 20, Natural 20!\nLAURA: Oh, you rattled the table, it was 15, then it fell over.\nLIAM: Oh, sorry, Charlie.\nLAURA: Seven for me, because he rattled the damn table, because he's an asshole.\nLIAM: Yeah. Separate issues.\nLAURA: And then Trinket rolled a 21.\nTRAVIS: Oh, I'm not eating.","response":"DM: Oh, you're not eating?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I thought it was just you two guys.\nLAURA: It was us and Trinket.\nLIAM: I elbow my sister, then dive into the pie.\nbakers suddenly come by and hold the hands back. (growls aggressively)\nLAURA: He's really drunk! Don't touch him too much.\nLAURA: No hands, Trinket.\nLIAM: He lost half his family here, in the attack on Whitestone.\nTRAVIS: Wow.\nLAURA: Natural one for me.\nLIAM: Oh boy, I got a big six.\nLAURA: Come on, Trinket!\nSAM: (whispers) Luck!\nLIAM: Yes, thank you, Scanlan. I got a big seven.\nLAURA: 14 for Trinket. I rolled a one.","response":"DM: Yeah. Okay, so as you both finish your secondary pie, you both sit up and look at each other with dark purple berry filling down the side of your face. You both make eye contact at the same time, as you both go (vomiting sound) and release your fresh payload into the pans before you. Baker comes by, slamming the hand down. “Disqualified!” You look around the side, you aren't the only ones. A number of other individuals have dropped out now. You're down to five people at the table that are still eating, one of which is Trinket, who finishes his second pie. Food smeared all across the face, getting all in the beard. Some of it has dribbled down into the chest hair, it's a pretty terrifying sight. Third pies are slammed down on the table. These last five individuals and Trinket. Have Trinket roll another constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Come on, Trink!\nLAURA: You want to inspire him?","response":"DM: You're adding your modifier, right?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 13.","response":"DM: You're adding your modifier, right?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What modifier?","response":"DM: His constitution modifier."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah.\nLAURA: Buddy. You can keep doing it! I'll give you–\nSAM: Food?\nLAURA: I know, I got nothing. A nice nap. You can have the bed tonight and I'll sleep on the floor.","response":"DM: (pants) He looks over and another pie is set down, the fourth round of pies go down. The last three and Trinket join in. Make another constitution saving throw for Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. It was almost a fucking 15. 15.","response":"DM: A 15? Total?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah. Oh no.","response":"DM: That set of pies finished, two of the remaining three end up getting up partway through the pie and one of them vomits off to the side. The other one stops, stands up and walks away, going (distressed noises). Spits out the food in his mouth in his hand, re-examining his life. The other remaining gentleman finishes the pie. There's sweat down his face (panting), you see the little bit of a chinstrap beard he has just covered in berries and bits of crust, this awful appearance. Trinket finishes the last bits of the pie (chomp, distressed bellow)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I feel so guilty right now!\nLIAM: Why is he so good at being sad bear?\nLAURA: I know! Don't be sad bear, be happy bear!\nTRAVIS: 300 gold!\nLAURA: It's just 100 gold.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, a persuasion check for Trinket?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So he'll keep eating?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, buddy. 15?","response":"DM: 15. Trinket looks at you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I love you.","response":"DM: (distressed growls)"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You're like a Toddlers and Tiaras mom right now.\nLAURA: I know. This is the worst. I'm the worst mom.","response":"DM: Looks down and across the table, the gentleman who's also there scoots over right in front and goes, “May the best man win, eh?” Trinket goes, (loud growl)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Get angry! Eat angry!","response":"DM: There are bits of pie spattering across him on the ground. Two pies (thud) brought down in front. These are not fruit pies. These are meat pies."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh! That's so wrong!\nLAURA: That's okay, Trinket likes meat way more than fruit.","response":"DM: Then he goes, (distressed groans, sniffs)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is it a salmon pie? He likes fish.","response":"DM: Constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: With advantage, because it's meat?\nLAURA: Beause it's salmon. It's a salmon pie, and he loves salmon.","response":"DM: (pauses) Hold on. There do appear to be hints of fish inside. I will grant you advantage on this saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Fucking balls, mother bitch.\nMARISHA: Advantage?\nLAURA: I did roll with advantage. 11.","response":"DM: 11. Both of them dive into their pies, coasting through. At a certain point, Trinket stops and (pants) breathes heavily in the pie. You can see bits of it over the edge, just from the nostril flare, looks up at you (distressed growl)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's okay, buddy. It's okay.\nLIAM: I instinctively move behind Vex.\nALL: Good job, Trinket!","response":"DM: (weary growls)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You don't have to eat anything else if you don't want to.","response":"DM: (growls)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.\nTRAVIS: He gets to sleep on the bed.\nLAURA: You get to sleep on the bed and I will sleep on the damn floor.","response":"DM: Trinket steps up and pushes away from the guy and goes running towards you on his hands and knees."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, this guy. This guy is so drunk!\nTRAVIS: There was some mold in those pies!","response":"DM: The baker hands you a sack of gold. “For your friend.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Thank you.","response":"DM: When he's feeling better."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: My favorite kind of pie.\nLIAM: I come over to my sister with two big mugs of ale and hand one to her and say, here, don't swallow the first one, just swish around and spit it out, then the rest.\nLAURA: Okay.\nLIAM: That's a good one.","response":"DM: At this point, you can now hear voices start to raise, people going, “Oh, the Keeper, the Keeper's going to speak.” The people start gathering towards the center of town where the Sun Tree is. As you all begin to gather for this central moment of the festival, Keeper Yennen steps up. Cassandra steps up with him and you can see he's looking over the crowd, eventually meeting Percy's gaze."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Of course.","response":"DM: “Cassandra?” She comes as well. And you all step off out of the festival for a while. A few folks attempt to follow to see what's going on. Some of the guards usher them away. You guys are led into an empty building, looks to have been a home of some kind that has long since been abandoned. As you step inside, it's cold and still in here, very low light other than a little oil lantern that's been lit by one of the guards as you step inside. The door closes behind and Keeper Yennen turns around. “There is no real way that we can show our appreciation for what you've done for our people. But first and foremost, there are funds within the de Rolo family treasury left behind by the Briarwoods that we hope could help compensate for some of your expenditures and hardships you've undergone.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So many, just so many.","response":"DM: “This is, of course, at the behest of the de Rolo family, who are the inheritors of this fortune.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thanks, Percy.\nLAURA: Percival, you're looking very attractive today.\nTALIESIN: I know.\nTRAVIS: Very appropriate.","response":"DM: “Now, we've had a few weeks of peace and recovery, of rebuilding and reforging the real bonds of this society here in Whitestone. But going forward, there needs to be a governing force. I would like to ask of your wisdom and guidance, all of you, in deciding on what is to become of the future of this city. There are many options at our disposal. I'm overseeing a myriad of things throughout the town and as a man of religious importance, given the history, the people have recommended it does not behoove me to take any sort of position of ruling in this town. It would be natural, of course, for the people to, without question, follow anyone of the existing bloodline.” He looks both to Cassandra and to Percival. “Have you any thoughts on this matter? Any of you?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Of our members, only this one human over here on his hands and knees, is the expendable one of our group.\nLAURA: Hey.","response":"DM: At which point, the strange, burly man on all fours, at this point, Brother– who did not really notice, goes, “Is that your bear?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Maybe.\nTALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: “Strange folk. ”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't think any of us would– well, Percy, if you'd like to stay and rule?\nLIAM: Freddy, this is everything you've worked for.\nSAM: This is your birthright and you've earned it.\nTALIESIN: It was really not my birthright. I was not raised to rule.\nSAM: But you would be a fantastic ruler.\nMARISHA: And also sometimes, those birthrights are thrust upon us.\nTALIESIN: I still have work to do outside the city. Ripley's still on the loose and knows far too much. And I feel more than a little responsible for her and what she may do. Honestly, Cassandra had a better upbringing than I did for this sort of work.","response":"DM: At which point, Cassandra pipes up and goes, “Well, I understand what you're saying, brother, but I'm still rediscovering who I am. If the people of this town knew what I've done, what I was responsible for all these years.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You mean surviving being held hostage, surviving an ambush and being pelted with arrows?\nTALIESIN: They expect better of us, I know. I understand. We are held to a different standard. And it's difficult. Perhaps it's time for a council. Perhaps it's time for shared rule. There should always be a de Rolo in Whitestone, but perhaps we could share the weight.","response":"DM: “We could. I could.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yennen, would you be comfortable sharing some of this burden?\nLAURA: Do the de Rolos still stay in the giant castle? Or does that go to somebody else, then?\nTALIESIN: I think the de Rolos keep the castle, but I think we use the castle to–\nSAM: Wait, would you be on this council? And who would they be counseling? Is there no superior primate? Is there no, there's no–","response":"DM: “I believe what he's suggesting is that we make decisions by council, by vote.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: A triumvirate.","response":"DM: “If you will.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Quintumverate.\nSAM: Oh, four people?\nTALIESIN: Five.\nTRAVIS: A flatterdesplat.\nSAM: Flibbertigibbit.\nTALIESIN: A religious leader, someone from the farming communities, someone from the economic community, someone from the trade community–\nSAM: Someone from the gnome community.\nTALIESIN: From the citizenry.\nSAM: From the gnome community.\nTALIESIN: From some known community, yes.\nSAM: I accept.\nTALIESIN: Interests will be thought of and there will always be a noble to be a tiebreaker when necessary and to judge from a place of (sighs) greater good.","response":"DM: “Cassandra?” She steps back at this point and she looks, her hands shaking visibly. She looks up to you and steps forward and reaches up and puts her hand to the side of your face and looks to you with a piercing honesty and fear. She, lower lip quivering, whispers to you. “Percy, can I be trusted? Do you trust me?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: All things considered, I think that you're more trustworthy than I am, at this point. Let's not forget that I was the one who let you down first. I'm going to give her one of the stones.\nLAURA: We were– no, that was for the whole group! That was for the whole group, Percival.","response":"DM: “What is this?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's done.\nLIAM: Leave it alone.\nLAURA: (muffled) That's was going to save your fucking life later.\nTALIESIN: You're going to be so happy when we have instant access to the treasury.\nTALIESIN: If anything bad should happen, if there's any need of quick retreat or quick communication, this is a one-way trip to us. And in return, this is a one-way trip for us to you, in case of emergency.","response":"DM: She clasps it in her hand, holds it to her chest."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You were born for this. You were instructed in how to do this, where I never was.\nLAURA: And now you've got four other people keeping an eye on you.","response":"DM: She smiles and closes her eyes. “What you say is true.” She looks over at each member of your group and looks back to Keeper Yennen. “If it so pleases this intended council, It would be my honor to represent the de Rolo bloodline in keeping this town safe.” Keeper goes, “Then so be it. I shall inquire with the people of this town. We will forge a council voted by the greater peoples of this place. And we shall restore Whitestone to its former glory. Very well. Go, enjoy the rest of your festival.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What was that cash prize? You had mentioned some sort of–","response":"DM: “Well, talk with Percival.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I will organize–\nLAURA: Oh, you have to give it to us? It has to come from you? That feels shady.\nTALIESIN: Let's not forget that within six hours of meeting each other, I ended up handing over an enormous sum of money to you.\nLAURA: It was actually 500 gold.\nTALIESIN: It was quite a bit of gold, if I recall. You have it written down, don't you? That's so endearing.\nLIAM: Is it?","response":"DM: “Very well. Enjoy your festival, you've earned it. Go out, be merry. Let us all remember this time of year, the bonds that we carry, the loyalties that we hold to, and the heroism you stand for. Now go.” At which point, the guards open the door and he steps out. The cold air rushes in, and you can see now, quite a bit of soft snowfall is now coming upon the center of the town."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm sorry, is there a washroom here? My sister's a little drunk and managed to yak on me a bit and I would really love to wash up a bit. Anywhere nearby?","response":"DM: He points off to the side. There's a small bucket of cold water that's set by the side."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, I use it.","response":"DM: You manage to dampen your outfit to the point of getting it off, although it is a bit cold when you step outside now."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I follow him for a moment?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I haven't talked to you very much lately.\nLIAM: No, you haven't.\nLAURA: You seem a bit off. Yeah. What's going on?\nLIAM: Nothing. I'm tired. We can relax for the first time in weeks.\nLAURA: I noticed your girlfriend isn't talking to you. Did you do something?\nLIAM: I will tell you just about everything, but I don't think I want to talk about that.\nMARISHA: Percy.\nTALIESIN: Yes?\nMARISHA: I actually have a present for you.\nTALIESIN: Really?\nMARISHA: Yeah, it comes with a story.\nMARISHA: You're the only one I– should we go get drinks? Maybe we should go get drinks first. Let's go get drinks and then I'll give you your present.\nMARISHA: Alcohol makes everything better.\nTALIESIN: Alcohol does make everything better.\nLAURA: Speaking of presents, even though you're being kind of a dick.\nLIAM: Wow, you ran fast to catch up with me.\nLAURA: I was going to buy you something, but then I realized sometimes old is better than new.\nSAM: It's an old person.","response":"DM: Vox Machina's favorite!"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Kill it!\nLIAM: Already dead.\nLAURA: You know what that is?","response":"DM: As you open the package, you see before you, a familiar belt of leather, with a coiled snake on the buckle."}
{"prompt":"SAM: How did you get that?!\nLAURA: I've got ways.\nSAM: It was in Uriel's palace, wasn't it?\nLAURA: I'm a really good winker, if you haven't noticed.\nTRAVIS: She is.\nSAM: Did you wink somebody for that? You slutty little thing.\nLIAM: Hello, Simon. (slithering sound)\nSAM: Oh no, it's just a real snake, it's biting you!\nTRAVIS: Revenge achieved!\nLIAM: I am too embarrassed to look her in the eye, and stare for a moment, but then finally, still not looking at her because she's fucking freaking me out, pull her into a hug and say, I love you, Stubby. I'm never going to leave your side, I'm always going to be there. You can always be a pain in the ass like you are. I love you. Always have, always will. Thank you.\nLAURA: Thank you. And then I slap him across the face.\nLIAM: What the fuck was that for?\nLAURA: I love you, too.\nMARISHA: When I was helping the farmers clean up, I had this strange moment where I was walking through the field and saw a dead raven.\nSAM: Here it is.\nTALIESIN: You're doing very well.\nMARISHA: Thanks. I was looking at it and it reminded me of everything and I feel like I was instantly trying to forget about everything because I don't want to remember. But we should. And I don't want to remember you the way you were. Because it was scary, and I didn't like it. I like you now. So I took the dead bird and cleaned it and kept its skull and put it in this box for you, as a reminder of what you could have become. What any of us could have become, really, at any time. Because we shouldn't forget.\nTALIESIN: Thank you.\nMARISHA: It's a little macabre and I would have bought things, but we're out of money.\nTALIESIN: I won't forget.\nMARISHA: I'm glad that's not you.\nTALIESIN: I can't even think of what the revenge felt like anymore. It's not… it doesn't weigh on me. Just regret.\nMARISHA: Regret?\nTALIESIN: Of how much better I could have been. Thank you. I will try to be better.\nMARISHA: No better than you could have been. There's still a lot to come, you know.\nTALIESIN: That's my plan.\nMARISHA: I think we all wish we were better than we could have been. Seeing that bird, I'm sure the bird felt the same way. But fuck it, he's dead now.\nMARISHA: I know, I'm sorry.\nTALIESIN: No, we like it. Don't change.\nMARISHA: I'm glad you didn't change.\nSAM: Grog, I got you an Amazon gift card. It's a forest called the Amazon. You can go there and get a gift.\nTRAVIS: Is it far?\nSAM: Oh, really far, you'll never use it.\nTRAVIS: Re-gift!\nLIAM: Well guys, Vox Machina is now free and clear of all evil influence.\nMARISHA: No shadowy demons. Feels good.\nTRAVIS: Feels good!","response":"DM: With that, Vox Machina continues to enjoy the joyous affair that is the Winter's Crest festival. Snowfall slowly covering the night sky as the sun comes to dusk. You withdraw to tell stories, sing songs, and drink merrily as the friends you are, looking forward to the next chapter in your adventure. And with that, we're going to go ahead and close the Winter's Crest episode of our adventure and leave you guys to the holiday break. We have a couple cool announcements to make. One, we had our winner earlier from our subscriber count, we hit a hundred. Our winner, if they haven't already announced it, is Saxecutioner."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Saxecutioner.","response":"DM: You'll get yourself a cool care package we're going to ship out to you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I think the Boonzy Arts candle is going out.","response":"DM: Yes!"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Boonzy Arts candle. Scent-sy Saxecutioner.","response":"DM: Indeed, indeed. Let's see, we'll be gone for a few weeks until we come back for our next episode. We're on our holiday break, we're going to get our stuff taken care of, but we'll be back as soon as we can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do we know what date that is going to be at?\nLIAM: I mean, we come back next Thursday, right? Again, right? We play again every week. Every Thursday.\nZAC: The seventh.","response":"DM: The seventh. And I think Zac has something you wanted to mention."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Did you have a thing, Zac?","response":"DM: Come on in, buddy."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Lucas!\nTALIESIN: Lucas!\nZAC: Most people don't know–\nMARISHA: The man behind the curtain.\nZAC: The man that runs the boards. So Lucas is getting a promotion.","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: He's back there.\nLAURA: I see his legs. He's not walking this way.\nZAC: There's no hard feelings at all. I'm not dumping a load of shit on him and walking away.\nLUCAS: We'll figure it out.\nZAC: We'll figure it out. Everybody, so thank you guys so much. I don't really have anything more to say other than thank you.\nMARISHA and TRAVIS: Overlord, Overlord.\nZAC: Literally, not figuratively.","response":"DM: Zac has made us all feel so comfortable and so excited to create this whole thing and has given so much of himself and put so much of himself into this and really, if you have the opportunity on Twitter or wherever else to follow him to his new job, let him know and feel the appreciation. He's awesome and an amazing human being and we're going to miss him terribly. But we're so happy and excited for your new ventures."}
{"prompt":"ZAC: Yes!\nZAC: I'm going to exit on that.\nLAURA: Huzzah to Zac!\nALL: Huzzah! Huzzah to Zac!\nLAURA: It's still going.","response":"DM: It's everything I hoped it would be!"}

{"prompt":"CHRIS: Okay. Whoa.\nCHRIS: I rolled a 20.","response":"DM: Oh, there we go. See, there we go. Natural 20. Thank you so much for coming by, man. Seriously."}
{"prompt":"CHRIS: I really appreciate it. It was great to hang out. Watch the magic happen. My favorite quote of the night was, “Don't be sad bear, be happy bear.”\nCHRIS: I'm going to use that one. Take that one back with me.","response":"DM: Go for it. So guys, next year, look forward to the next Dungeons and Dragons module, “Don't Be Sad Bear.”"}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: A big veiny triumphant bastard.\nMARISHA: How about Snugglelord riding Travis's cock and balls?\nZAC: You've been challenged. You've been challenged. But I definitely want to do that to always have with me a little memory from this last year. I really honestly can't tell you guys how much this year meant to me and I want to make sure that I will never forget, even if my brain starts to fall away. I'll be like, oh look, Travis's–\nLAURA and MARISHA: Cock and balls.\nTRAVIS: He was so good at Halo.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Let's let the gates open.","response":"DM: Exactly. You guys, happy holidays."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, well, it's going to be a double feature. There will be a finale to the comic strip of the Winter's Crest festival, so keep checking the Geek and Sundry website because I believe it's going to go up on Christmas Eve, actually. So yeah, check it out.","response":"DM: Fantastic."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Still more stuff.\nLAURA: Is there going to be a Critical Role marathon or something coming up soon?","response":"DM: Are you guys playing Critical Role over the holidays?"}
{"prompt":"LUCAS: At some point.","response":"DM: At some point, there'll be a marathon."}

{"prompt":"LIAM: I have a snake!\nTRAVIS: See you on the other side.\nTRAVIS: Sam's here.","response":"DM: He's going to go ahead and get a Scanlan. Grog wouldn't be paying attention anyway. It's fine."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Squirrel!\nTALIESIN: (Grog voice) It's true. It's very true.","response":"DM: You've sent off word to Allura in Emon regarding the strange black dot that stands at the top of the ziggurat and letting her know the circumstance, and heard back from her that it seems that–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Smooth. Well done.","response":"DM: And welcome back, Sam Riegel."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Where am I?\nASHLEY: I know. It's so magical.\nSAM: What's going on? Oh my god, Ashley's here! Oh my god, you're here! Okay, sorry. You were recapping.","response":"DM: That's okay. So where was I? Yes, okay. So with the town being set where it is, you sent word to Allura Vysoren, and she's going to gather a few friends and investigate the ziggurat to see what the nature of this lingering magic is. However, there still stands the part of returning to the Council and proving your innocence, amongst other loose threads you wish to pursue. What would you like to do?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well, we have all that awesome proof, right?\nLAURA: I think we need to head back to Emon.\nSAM: Do we have proof? What do we have?\nLAURA: We have all of the documents that you took from the Briarwoods' stuff. Plus, we have–\nSAM: Physical? Do we have someone who could back up our testimony?\nLAURA: The new rulers, yeah.\nSAM: Well, they're not going to come with us, are they?\nLAURA: Well, we've got Percival. He's kind of in charge.\nTALIESIN: I'm kind of a big deal.\nMARISHA: I feel like they'll see that as a conflict of interest.\nTALIESIN: That's fair.\nSAM: Should we bring someone along to corroborate our stories?\nLIAM: What about– I know someone needs to mind the store here in town, but Cassandra was in their pockets for a long time, and what about Father–\nMARISHA: Yennen? Yevon? Yennen?\nTALIESIN: We could have them write a letter, and we can seal it and then it would be official.\nLAURA: Let's do that.\nMARISHA: Make sure that they notarize it and all that good stuff.\nTALIESIN: Governments function on paperwork. People have to take this seriously.\nLAURA: That's right. They can't very well arrest Percival when he's royalty now.\nLIAM: Technically royalty before.\nLAURA: Well, now he's rich royalty.\nTALIESIN: We have money now.\nSAM: Do we? How much money do we have?\nTALIESIN: It depends on what we want.\nMARISHA: Depends on what we want?\nTALIESIN: We can't bankrupt the treasury or anything, but I'm sure that we can dip.\nLAURA: 50,000 gold?\nTALIESIN: Don't put a number on family.\nLAURA: Flying carpet gold?\nTALIESIN: That's actually a very good question.\nTRAVIS: So we go get a letter and we go back to Emon and clear our name.\nSAM: That's our evidence?\nLAURA: Plus all of the documents that you found!\nTALIESIN: Actually, that's a really interesting idea. Is there anybody in town who could re-enchant our carpet?\nMARISHA: Well, he said it would take a year, and you'd need to have Allura work on that.\nTALIESIN: I'm asking the Yellow Pages.","response":"DM: As far as you know from your experience in the town, there were two main sources of individuals that had focused on enchanting items. One of which, their abode or their shop had been collapsed and they were no longer seen, and the other one had apparently been acquired by the Briarwoods to aid them in the construction of the ziggurat and you met his daughter, and he never turned up."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. Maybe we can wait until we get back to Emon and have Gilmore do it.\nTALIESIN: We'll talk to them and see what's possible.\nLAURA: Oh, we can't really ask Allura to do it. We stole the carpet from her in the first place. That would be a very bad move, I think.\nTRAVIS: Oh, we could just say somebody stole it from her. We stole it from them, we were trying to return it, it fell in acid.\nLAURA: But then what? We wouldn't get it back.\nTRAVIS: Well, she fixes it. Oh, here's a gift for recovering the rug. It makes perfect sense to me.\nMARISHA: To be fair, she was just using it as a rug.\nTRAVIS: Right.\nMARISHA: Right?\nSAM: Yeah, that seems like a really expensive rug.\nLAURA: Maybe she was keeping it secret. Keeping it safe.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to craft that thing that I've been wanting to craft, so that was, that we talked about.","response":"DM: Okay, so over the past few days. Okay. As you guys are all preparing the circumstance over these next few days, you've gone into your original workshop, which is a little more ramshackle than the one you have back in Emon that was built for you. This was just the one that you had pieced together while you were growing up in Whitestone. I would like for you to go ahead and make a tinkering check, if you don't mind."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Plus, we had them send word to Uriel, remember? We had them send a letter to Uriel, explaining all the wonderful things we did. Yes, I talked to him.\nTALIESIN: Shut up!\nTRAVIS: How did the golden snitch do?\nLIAM: Not well. Not with that face.\nTALIESIN: Can I use my resolve?","response":"DM: That's a saving throw, unfortunately. That's not a skill check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 11.","response":"DM: 11? This is to craft the–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well, I'm doing the whole kit and caboodle.","response":"DM: The entire thing?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Well, if I can break it up into chunks, then that will be– taking it apart. I'm going to take it apart, I'm going to put it back together, and I'm going to add the fifth barrel.","response":"DM: Okay. (sighs) You manage to pull apart, over the period of a few days, Ripley's pistol. You take aspects of whitestone and residuum dust as well as residuum glass and begin to reconstruct it, based on its elements, in a much more refined, in a much more Percival-practiced method. You attach the fifth barrel, the one that you intend to be used to deliver short-range explosives, and it seems to fit together."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay.","response":"DM: It's nothing fancy, and a little part of you goes like, it's rattling a little when you shake it in your hand."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Can I give it a once-over?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a perception check. No, this would be investigation."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I hate you. The difference between those rolls are really impressive.","response":"DM: This is where the intellect plays off, guys."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Whoa! Okay, I'm going to point out that I just rolled my die before the game started and rolled a natural 20 on my first roll. Five.\nTRAVIS: 2016, bitch.","response":"DM: Okay. It looks pretty solid. You think it would be wise to take additional materials with you as you leave, just in case you want to build something else, but this seems functional."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I've got all the little bits. I'm going to definitely– I've learned my lesson.","response":"DM: So in theory, going forward, the gun does function, but every misfire number is increased by two."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: So that gives me a three and a–","response":"DM: A misfire of three on the pistol and what is now a misfire of five with the fifth barrel."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That'll be funny. Oh, I also have to make some ammo for it, since it's individual ammo, so should I just roll for that?\nLAURA: So we're heading back to Emon. But we did send a letter ahead!","response":"DM: You sent a letter, notifying them of what has happened, that Whitestone has been freed."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And remember I said make sure to tell them how Vox Machina saved the day, and how wonderful we are, and you said, yes you would do that.","response":"DM: As far as you know, that's been sent."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So all the messages– because I sent word out to Gilmore, as well– we haven't heard anything back from anyone, though. It's too soon, yeah?","response":"DM: It's been pretty soon. That was just a few days ago in Whitestone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I also think I probably sent a letter to Pike to let her know that we're safe and we survived everything, and that she would've been at Winter's Crest.","response":"DM: It was hard thinking of an address in Vasselheim that would reach her, but you did your best to conjecture, and you attempted it, so we'll see if it finds its way."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Maybe it worked!\nSAM: On our horses that we own. Do we own horses?\nMARISHA: They were eaten by harpies.\nSAM: Let's go buy some horses.\nTALIESIN: On the harpies that we own.\nLAURA: They've got to, right? They have horses here.\nLIAM: Percival, you have the run of this place, somewhat.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to assume that I can use some family connections to finagle a few horses.","response":"DM: Okay. I'd say you're looking at probably about five to six days' travel on horseback to get back to Emon."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is there a faster way?\nMARISHA: There's no teleportation circles, is there?\nLAURA: No. They don't have one.\nLIAM: Can't you walk us through an oak tree?\nMARISHA: I can. Yeah. Actually.\nLAURA: Yeah, walk us through an oak tree!\nSAM: All of us?\nMARISHA: Long as we all jump within six seconds.\nSAM: What happens if we don't?\nLAURA: We're left behind.","response":"DM: Yeah, it's not a challenge, really. It's just a very short time period. Yeah, you can do that if you want to."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We have an instant teleportation as a worst-case scenario.\nSAM: And where does it take us?\nMARISHA: Home. To our keep.\nSAM: Sounds crazy. Can we always use this?\nTALIESIN: We'll actually in theory beat the letters that we sent. That's okay; we have proof.\nMARISHA: But it's coming. It's on the way.\nSAM: So wait, you can zap us anywhere in the world?\nMARISHA: I have a 6th-level spell called Teleportation via Plants, where as long as I've seen the tree before, we can walk through the tree.\nLAURA and TALIESIN: We're getting another letter.\nLAURA: Sealed, so it looks like we didn't tamper with it.","response":"DM: Easy enough to get it signed by Keeper Yennen, you get it signed by Cassandra."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And everything is good here for when we go, Percival? Your sister and everyone, Keeper what's-his-butt?\nTALIESIN: If anything goes wrong, we'll hear about it, and we can come back.\nSAM: What's going on with the spinning black cube? Are we okay?\nLAURA: Isn't Allura on her way here? Aren't a lot of people on their way here? I'm so confused.\nMARISHA: That's true, wasn't Allura on her way?\nSAM: What happened in 2015? The whole way through. Start from the beginning.\nLIAM: Well, first there were dinosaurs.","response":"DM: Yes. Last you were told, Allura is coming with a couple of companions to investigate the ziggurat. There was no indication that you're required for that, nor could you really aid in that–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Speak for yourself.","response":"DM: Well, your vast understanding of arcane elements and the history of magic should come in handy."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And Drez Vina, right? He's coming, too? He's had a notice to him?","response":"DM: Drez Vina?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Not Drez Vina.\nLIAM: That's in the Wayback Machine.","response":"DM: You haven't seen Drez Vina in about a year and a half."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: The emperor dude?\nLAURA: No.\nLIAM: Victor, the powder guy.\nTRAVIS: Are you looking for the notes that you don't take?\nLAURA: I take notes!\nLIAM: Ivan from the other show? Do you mean Ivan, from the show before us?\nLAURA: I'm going to find his name, don't you guys worry, then I'm going to bring it right up.\nLIAM: She's the brains of the group.\nTRAVIS: Can we go get that other fucking letter please?\nMARISHA and TALIESIN: We got it.","response":"DM: You acquired it. It didn't take much time."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Theoretically, they were trying to keep Allura from us, anyway, so it's not like she can help us in Emon. Right? So we can go home.\nTALIESIN, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's go home.\nLAURA: Let's hop in a tree.\nMARISHA: Let's hop in a tree. What?\nLIAM: I'm just going to say, here's what we don't know: if we beat the letters home, if we try to walk up with the letter, we should send someone to them with the letter because probably Uriel came to his senses once Sylas was hit with some dicks?\nTRAVIS: What, we can't go find that boy you abused in Emon and have him send the letter?\nLIAM: Who?\nTRAVIS: That little kid you smacked around who wanted to join–\nLIAM: He's long gone, man. I don't know where he is.\nTRAVIS: He's probably back, drawing pictures of you on the city walls and crying.\nLIAM: Get in line. But I don't think we want to walk up ourselves, just in case. We should send somebody.\nLAURA: We'll head home. We'll send our butler.\nTALIESIN: He's senile and gentle; they'll be kind.\nLAURA: Yes. They'll be very wonderful to him. I can't find it.\nMARISHA: Well, we technically already have a letter coming, and we'll have a letter in hand. Right?\nLIAM: Maybe we need more letters.\nSAM: It'll be fine.","response":"DM: You also, be reminded, you that you have a prisoner in the bottom of Greyskull Keep that was a survivor of the Briarwood–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: If he's still alive.","response":"DM: Yeah, you haven't checked in."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We don't know.\nTRAVIS: We'll find out as soon as we get there.\nTALIESIN: At least he'll be going home to a very nice surprise.\nTRAVIS: I got one gold piece he's turned to kibble.\nLAURA: Oh no.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I hope our keep's still there.\nSAM: Before we go, can I shit-scry?\nMARISHA: To see our keep to make sure it's not on fire? That's not a bad idea. Let's do it.","response":"DM: For people tuning in for the first time, I'm going to give you no context."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm going to concentrate really hard on my bowels. See if I can see anything.\nLIAM: Roleplay this, Sam.\nSAM: Fiber. No movement yet.","response":"DM: As you concentrate and close your eyes, you take a moment to connect with that one moment in Greyskull Keep, above the kitchen where you had left your last present."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's a gift to the world, really.","response":"DM: This being relatively early morning on this part of the countryside, you do look in and you see that there is part of a breakfast being cooked for whoever's running the guard time-portion that part of the morning. Currently, nothing else catching your attention."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Breakfast being cooked, seriously.\nMARISHA: You guys want some pancakes and bacon?\nTRAVIS: Deep-fried French toast, baby.","response":"DM: You do see Laina in there walk in and start cooking up some stuff and walk back out."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, and she doesn't look like she's bleeding from the eyes?","response":"DM: No, she looks to be quite healthy and quite jovial, whistling a little tune, although you can't hear it so well."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Eskil Ryndarien was the one I was thinking of.","response":"DM: There you go, Eskil Ryndarien. That's the one, yeah. The archmage in Westruun."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Those notes are written on her Pathfinder sheet, tucked in.\nSAM: How do we do this, Keyleth? And more importantly, how do we do it so that the bear doesn't come with us?\nMARISHA: The bear will probably be able to come with us. Sorry.\nLIAM: Pick a fat tree.\nTALIESIN: Well, we have a really big fat tree right in the town.\nLIAM: After all that pie, Trinket's a little wide in the haunches.\nLAURA: He looks good.\nMARISHA: He can fit through the Sun Tree, right?","response":"DM: The Sun Tree's definitely a large enough tree to create the portal you can step through, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Let's use the Sun Tree.\nMARISHA: I say, hey boo. I'll see you soon.","response":"DM: You hear the tree silently fist bump you through its arcane connection."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You be good, you take care of you, man.","response":"DM: You hear a voice whisper in the back of your mind, “You too, girl.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: This is the best tree of all time.\nLIAM: Tolkien would be proud, Matt.","response":"DM: As you trace your fingers across the surface of the Sun Tree, its large, curled boughs now starting to sprout remnants of what looks to be fresh leaves. Where your fingers trace, the bark itself seems to glow with a bright vibrant yellowish-orange color. As you create a full oval shape that would fit most of your party, suddenly, there's a sucking sound, and it's like the bark is pulled into a distant doorway. And from what you can see, it's almost like someone carved a tunnel through the Sun Tree that traverses for about 30 or so feet."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Are these cartoon physics?","response":"DM: Essentially."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah! We should go soon, though. Right?\nMARISHA: Jump!","response":"DM: All of you guys come walking through it, and it is a short-term tunnel. Immediately, you can see the other side of it, and as you step through, you can already feel behind you the entrance closing. As you push through with Trinket and Grog pulling up the rear, you can feel the actual tunnel closing behind you. All of you come bursting out of the other side of one of the trees that is currently planted inside the temple to Sarenrae within Greyskull Keep, and as you all gather yourselves and hear the closing sound, the (sucking sound) of the doorway closing behind you, you glance about and you can see all the stained glass, the rosebushes that are well kept, there are a series of small wooden benches that are placed in a pattern, and behind you, you see currently wiping down the stone on the front of the temple is, in plain clothes, a sleepy-eyed, currently woken-up Pike."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Pike!\nASHLEY: Hi!\nSAM: What are you doing here?\nMARISHA: Why are you sleeping outside? You have a bed upstairs!\nASHLEY: No, I do! I couldn't sleep!\nLAURA: I thought you were in Vasselheim!\nMARISHA: How long have you been here? So many questions!","response":"DM: When you had heard the party was going to Whitestone, you were already in fear of what may lie there, knowing the history of Percy's past and hearing bits here and there. You came to try and catch them before they left, but by the time you came to Emon, they had already been gone for quite some time."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So you've been scrying to us the whole time from here?\nASHLEY: Yes!\nLAURA: Why didn't you say anything?\nASHLEY: I didn't think to say anything.\nMARISHA: We literally kicked it for a weekend and went to a festival. We could've come back.\nASHLEY: I know, but work needed to be done.\nTRAVIS: So thoughtful, Pike! Oh, my best friend! She's so thoughtful.\nASHLEY: So you guys made it out.\nMARISHA: Yeah, thanks to you. (excited stammering) Did you feel our bag of dicks that we did? Were you aware of our bag of holy light dicks? That was an out-of-context thing.\nASHLEY: I don't know what that is, but it sounds pretty fascinating.\nMARISHA: Me and you teamed up, and we killed Lady Briarwood by–\nASHLEY: Oh yes, how could I forget!\nMARISHA: Well, I didn't know how aware you were, because your connection was fuzzy.\nASHLEY: Fully aware of the bag of dicks.\nMARISHA: That was awesome!\nASHLEY: I totally spaced. Oh wow.\nTALIESIN: Who taught you the phrase “bag of dicks?”\nMARISHA: I read it in a book.\nLAURA and ASHLEY: Hi.\nTRAVIS: Bag of Richards.\nASHLEY: Bag of Richards?\nLAURA: Have you seen the prisoner here?\nASHLEY: There's a prisoner here?","response":"DM: You haven't, actually, in the time you've been here."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: No, I haven't. I've been cleaning. I've had such a need to clean.\nTRAVIS: We actually need him for something. You want to come see him? Yeah, we're protecting him. Let's go. We run down.","response":"DM: As you guys head out of the temple, it leads you into the main foyer area. Stepping out into the foyer, you immediately hear a loud metal clang in the hallway around to your right."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Is it my armor just falling over?","response":"DM: And you all immediately stop for a moment."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hello? What was that?","response":"DM: You hear some other rustling down at the edge of the hallway."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are we on the top floor, or down where the–","response":"DM: You guys are in the foyer of the main temple's base floor."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Pike, stay here. I'll take care of this.\nASHLEY: Are you sure?\nSAM: I was born sure.\nASHLEY: Okay.\nSAM: I go forth to investigate.","response":"DM: Okay. Make a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: As he walks down the stairs, I call out: don't get caught, shithead.\nSAM: Stealth?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 18.","response":"DM: Okay. As you come around the corner into the main central hallway of the foyer you can see there is, to the right is the dining room area, and that's closed, and you can smell the breakfast being cooked in the kitchen that's far down to the right of the hallway. To the left is the arcane laboratory. The door is currently ajar, and you hear the rustling from the inside."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Aw, someone's going through our shit.\nSAM: I'm going in there to investigate. You know what? I'll go invisible first, and then I'll creep in.\nSAM: I drop my invisibility and go over and give Tibsy a big hug.","response":"DM: Out of nowhere you, (startled grumbling) And pushes you away and grabs the staff and spins around."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's me! It's me! Little, yellow, different! Me!","response":"DM: “You mustn't sneak up on a Stormwind like that.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I go in. Hi Tibs!","response":"DM: As you guys walk in, you see Tiberius seems both surprised and keeping a composure element to him, his chin high. “Greetings and salutations, friends. I'd hoped I'd see you before heading out.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Heading out?\nTALIESIN: Heading what?","response":"DM: “Well, I've spent a few weeks in Draconia trying to secure aid for us in Whitestone.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are you from Draconia?","response":"DM: “Indeed I am. But over these past few weeks I've been continuously balked by my father. By the time I had given up and came to join you, word found me of your victory. Thus, I instead remained here in Emon. I've had some time to think, being here on my own for the better part of a week now. I consider you all friends and fine warriors, mostly. I've enjoyed our travels together, I've learned much, and for that I thank you sincerely. However, my diplomatic mission has fallen to the wayside in these recent months, and while my personal mission to recover these artifacts has grown stagnant, as proven by my time in Draconia, I have still yet to gain the respect of my family. I feel that the path of Vox Machina and the path of Tiberius Stormwind haven't been aligned for some time. In hearing about your victory with the Stormwinds– oh, that's me– your victory with the Briarwoods, made me think that while I was sure that you all needed me to protect you, I may have underestimated you all. Perhaps you are quite capable without a Stormwind. And perhaps I am more capable on my own pursuits, with no distractions. I respect you all very deeply, and hope to continue to hear of your exploits across Tal'Dorei, but I think it is time–” And he takes his staff and smacks it on the ground and picks up his bag of things. “I think it is time this dragonborn carved his own path.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You must leave immediately?","response":"DM: “I've been packing for a few days, as you know.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I go up and hug him, and say: what would you like us to tell Uriel? I know they are wanting you in court.","response":"DM: “The politics of these strange human kingdoms don't really affect me. At least I figure you've got this taken care of, and you'll speak in my name, of course, right, right?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course.","response":"DM: “Of course. So. Don't mess that up.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course not, darling.","response":"DM: “At the time they'd even come to find me, I'm sure the name would be cleared.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I come out behind my sister and I take him by the hand and I say: Tiberius, your friendship was always valued here. I don't think we'd be standing here without you.","response":"DM: “That's true.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I will never forget you.","response":"DM: “As I shall never forget all of you.” And you can see for a second there's a little tear cresting in his nose, and he like, “Dust. You know that, of course.” He looks around, takes a moment."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Speaking as a man who has also had a romantic interest in ladies before– are there any romantic messages you'd like me to pass on for you to anyone in this town? Or others.","response":"DM: “You? No.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I will. Bye, Tibsy. I give him a hug.","response":"DM: He pats you on the shoulder. “I'm very terrible at goodbyes, so–” He steps back. “Goodbye.” Flicks his wrist and you can see an already prepared  teleportation circle in the room flash with blue runes as his image, waving towards you, scatters into nothing."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Shit.","response":"DM: The runes die down to a cold magicless circle."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Safe travels, Stormwind.\nSAM: Well, shit.\nLIAM: Said the S.H.I.T.s.\nTRAVIS: Did he leave us anything?\nSAM: Grog.\nTRAVIS: What?\nSAM: Come on. Maybe we should check his room just in case.\nTRAVIS: That's what I'm saying! Oh, we have a prisoner downstairs, though.\nTALIESIN: Oh god, that's right.\nASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes.\nTRAVIS: We run down to the prison cell.\nLAURA: I stay and walk around his room a little bit.\nTRAVIS: Dragged back out.","response":"DM: Dragged back out. See within the cell is the small boy from Whitestone who's also now eating off his own small platter as well, and his eyes light up, mouth full of eggs. (muffled talking) He seems to be fine and in good health."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Any other attacks on the castle while we were gone?\nLIAM: Yes, how did you fare?","response":"DM: “There were no other attacks as far as I know, we kept a very very close eye, and for a while we had a fine elemental protector from, with help here from Lady Keyleth.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes, how did that work? Just curious, because he was kind of a test run.","response":"DM: “Yeah, very unsettling, to be perfectly honest. ”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh good, good. That's what I was going for.","response":"DM: “Yeah, I don't feel comfortable with haphazardly tethered creatures from other realms. It historically has gone very poorly, so it was good to know that nothing bad terribly happens.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Sure! Awesome.\nTALIESIN: Well, the good news is, we can let you go. You're free and clear, the Briarwoods will not be a problem anymore, and Whitestone is rather pleasant at the moment.\nTRAVIS: He's not free and clear.\nSAM: He's got to come with us to testify.\nTALIESIN: Oh, that's right, I suppose there is the matter of testimony.\nLAURA: I come down the stairs at this point.\nTALIESIN: But we can open the cell, at the very least.\nLAURA: Yeah, why is he still in that cell?\nTALIESIN: For his own protection, but that's hardly a matter anymore.\nMARISHA: Right, remember, we were going to let him stay him the guest room, but he was like, I'm going to stay–\nLIAM: Boy, what was your name again?","response":"DM: Waiting to see if she has it in her notes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well, I mean, I'll find it.\nSAM: I've got it, I've got it somewhere.\nMARISHA: It's in my old notebook.","response":"DM: Always fun to test these things."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Dante. Dmitri. Damien. Dingleberry. Darren. Dane. Dylan?\nLIAM: Matthew Mercer.","response":"DM: Technically."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Earthbreaker Groon. Arbiter Brom. Ben Klauss.\nLIAM: Anemone Tea.\nLAURA: Desmond. Desmond? Desmond!","response":"DM: I knew one of you wrote it down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Desmond, I had it right here, right there. Desmond.","response":"DM: Desmond goes, “It's over? The Briarwoods are no more?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes. All taken care of.","response":"DM: And you visually see a weight off his shoulders. He seems to shrink almost three inches from just the full exhale of his body, and a little bit of tears well up in his eyes and he says, “Whitestone? Does it still stand?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's beautiful. And growing.","response":"DM: “I can't wait to get back.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Desmond, dear?","response":"DM: “Yes?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Before you do, could we ask a small favor of you?","response":"DM: “Of course. You kept me safe, you saved me. Most of me.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Would you mind speaking on our behalf to Emperor Uriel? Emperor? Sovereign Uriel. That'd be great. That'd just be wonderful.","response":"DM: “Of course, I'd be happy to, it'd be my pleasure.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Thank you. And you can, you know, come out of the cell and eat with us, now.","response":"DM: “Great.” And he goes and off the little stone slab there he pulls his platter, which is already half-eaten, and eagerly walks up holding it with you, expectantly."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, right now! Sure, let's go then.\nTRAVIS: Oh, let me carry your plate for you. And I start eating his food.","response":"DM: Okay. He doesn't notice, he's too excited. You guys make your way back up to the dining room area, and it's at that time that you see, coming down the hall, Laina. Turns around the corner and goes, “Pike?”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Hi! There's more of us now!","response":"DM: “Oh, goodness me, look, everyone's returned! That's wonderful, it's so good to see all of you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good to see you too.\nLIAM: You've kept the house in order. Good job, thank you.","response":"DM: “I've done my best. I'm so excited to see that you're all well. You don't look very well fed. I can fix that. Come on, this way.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Brilliant. Brilliant.","response":"DM: “I've just gotta make a little bit more, but first course is coming! Please, please.” And she opens the doors and leads you guys in the dining area. You all sit down, Desmond joins you, and she comes back and begins to prepare the rest of the meal for you over the next half-hour or so. While you dined on some really, really fine Whitestone food while you were enjoying the fruits of the Winter's Crest festival, it is nice to have a home-cooked meal for a while."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Traditional Emon breakfast.\nLAURA: Eggs, baked beans–\nLIAM: Yeah, fried tomato. Yeah, blood sausage.\nSAM: Huevos rancheros.\nLIAM: You dick.\nMARISHA: What's today? What day is it?\nLAURA: Are there days of the week? What is a weekend?\nMARISHA: Yeah, there's days of the week.\nSAM: What is this world? How does time work here?","response":"DM: There are days of the week, I'm not gonna go into the specifics of it because I'm working on it. This question hasn't really arisen before and I probably should figure that out. It's the equivalent of a Thursday."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's always Thursday.\nTALIESIN: So it's not hump day but we're not quite waiting for the weekend yet?\nTRAVIS: Hump day!\nTALIESIN: Oh, Grog. By the way.\nTRAVIS: Yeah? Shit.\nTALIESIN: Did you think I'd forget?\nTRAVIS: I throw him a gold coin.\nTALIESIN: Thank you.\nSAM: What's that for?\nTRAVIS: I thought Kibble would be dead, but he's alive.\nSAM: Who?\nLAURA and LIAM: Desmond.\nTRAVIS: Oh, Desmond.\nASHLEY: You call him Kibble?","response":"DM: “What?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, we were just saying how well you look.","response":"DM: “Okay.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, keep eating, Kibble.","response":"DM: He just continues finishing."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: If he dies, you don't get the gold coin back.\nTRAVIS: Fuck.\nSAM: How is his hand doing?","response":"DM: Missing."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I mean, is it okay, there's no gangrene?","response":"DM: No, it was properly dressed and has been changed as time went on while you guys were gone."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Pike, no Pike didn't know he was here.\nLIAM: Yeah, that's unfortunate.\nMARISHA: She didn't go downstairs.\nASHLEY: I didn't, I just didn't need to go down there.\nLIAM: But there it is, right in front of you, all red and swollen, gross.\nLAURA: No, it's fine.\nASHLEY: How's his hand? How's your hand, Desmond?\nLIAM: Can you do this? Can you do this, Desmond?","response":"DM: Crying into his eggs."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh no.\nMARISHA: That's mean, that's mean.","response":"DM: You're terrible."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Him and little boys, man.\nLAURA: I thought Desmond was like a teenager. Is he, how young is he?\nLIAM: Yeah, I did too.","response":"DM: Oh no, he's like close to 18, 19."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, there we go, a kid.\nTRAVIS: Impressionable. Formative years.\nSAM: Of age.\nTRAVIS: Of age.\nASHLEY: Is his hand gone?","response":"DM: He's missing most of his fingers and a large part of the upper part of the hand is missing. Yeah, it's bandaged over, and he's still able to kind of use part of the thumb."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I had a really bad day. I had a really bad day.\nASHLEY: Can I try doing a little healing?\nTALIESIN: I was possessed by an evil smoke demon.\nASHLEY: Might as well. Get the dice rolling.\nSAM: Oh, Pike! Everyone stand back, my lady's going to do something.\nTALIESIN: She's going to try and undo some of my poor decision-making.\nLAURA: Can you grow back his digits?\nTRAVIS: No, I don't think so.\nASHLEY: What happened?\nTRAVIS: Tell the truth.\nTALIESIN: That's a good question.\nLIAM: I think Whitestone owes this boy a little coin.\nTALIESIN: I would agree. Perhaps send him, I will send him–\nSAM: Well, after his testimony, should it prove to be valuable.\nMARISHA: How much coin did we pull out of the treasury of Whitestone?\nLAURA: How about we don't talk about this in front of other people?\nTRAVIS: I could give him one of the expensive bottles of wine.\nTALIESIN: How about I send him with a letter making sure that he is well-employed.\nLAURA: I think that is a beautiful, beautiful gesture.\nSAM: We should solve all of our problems with letters from now on.\nTALIESIN: If people would just learn, oh never mind.\nLIAM: Percival. Coin.\nLAURA: No.\nLIAM: Yes.\nSAM: How about after the testimony? He hasn't fulfilled his duty.\nLIAM: Fine. Fine.\nTALIESIN: I'm not sure what the price tag on a–\nASHLEY: Can I try Lesser Restoration?\nLIAM: Somewhat higher than zero.\nTALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: Restoration is more of a, restoration is more of a removal of impairments to, on like the whole, like curses, charms, things that affect their body and mind wholly. Current, you know, like that. What you're looking for is more of a very minor regeneration, which I would allow to a very small extent with a high-powered heal."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You just blow in his thumb and all the fingers go–\nLAURA: I mean, you grew one of Liam's, Vax's toes back.\nLIAM: That took a long time, though.\nTRAVIS: But we really care about Vax, and this guy can look down at his hand and remember the time that he worked for some shitty vampires. We leave it be.","response":"DM: What do you wanna do, Pike?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Has he stabilized, is he stable?\nASHLEY: I want to try healing him a little bit.","response":"DM: Okay, so what level Cure Wounds you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Let's do two.\nSAM: Can I inspire her healing?","response":"DM: You can, actually, 'cause I'm gonna have a wisdom check from her in a moment as part of that."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Ooh!","response":"DM: 2d8 plus five."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: O'Brien approves.\nSAM: There once was a gnome from Emon, who sang a scandalous song, the ladies would swoon, at his rather large tune, and say “My, it's impossibly long.”\nLAURA: That's beautiful.\nASHLEY: Wow, that was so inspiring. 15.","response":"DM: Okay, so you heal 15 points, that's good. Go ahead and roll a d20, add your wisdom modifier which I think is plus five, and then add another d10 to that because of his inspiration."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Natural–\nLAURA: – 20!","response":"DM: Roll a d10 just to add on to it, see how–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You got a 20?\nSAM: This guy's gonna get a brand-new hand!\nASHLEY: Three hands! Four.","response":"DM: Okay. So as part of the healing, as you take his hand, you pull the bandages off, and you can still see the wounds are scabbed over, and it's healing but it's healing over. As you concentrate for a moment, close your eyes, you can see the symbol of Sarenrae and that glows for a moment, and that healing energy transfers down your arms to your forearms, to your fingertips, and into the wound. And his hand begins to give off its own radiant energy. He freaks out and backs up for a second, but you–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: It's okay.","response":"DM: – keep his hand there, calm him down. As the light fades, you can see the wound itself is now closed over entirely, and the part where he can only partially use his thumb and his finger, that section has completely healed over and both his thumb and his pinky finger are complete now. And can be used to grab."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Like a claw, like a crab.","response":"DM: But it's functional! There you go."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Hang loose, buddy!\nSAM: He's got shaka hand.\nLAURA: That's awesome!","response":"DM: Much more useful."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And it doesn't hurt anymore.","response":"DM: Nope. No longer needs any dressing whatsoever."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Nicely done, Pike! Wow.\nLIAM: Coin, Percival, coin.\nLAURA: Stop telling him what to give him.\nLIAM: You shut up.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to make my sister pay.\nLAURA: Yes, see. And that way, dear brother, he won't be on the road with lots of gold in his pocket to get stolen.\nSAM: Oh yes, we're looking out for his better interests.\nLIAM: You are so caring.\nTALIESIN: And I should also mention I don't have any money at the moment, so this is also–\nLAURA: That's why we have that fabulous crystal.\nTALIESIN: I gave your sister all my money. I did!\nLAURA: Long time ago.\nTALIESIN: Well, it was a long time ago, but it was all my money.\nTRAVIS: About what time is it?\nLIAM: This conversation is now making me uncomfortable.","response":"DM: 10:00 or 11:00 in the morning?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Should we go in to meet our jury?\nLAURA: Oh god. Wait, can I just ask, because we had three days and I didn't check on it, I had that jewelry box that we stole from the Tylieri house?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Maybe we can just hand over the bloody bag of gold to Desmond.\nSAM: Well, let's look at it first.","response":"DM: The bloody bag of gold, sifting through it, it contains the equivalent of 230 gold pieces."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Awesome! And then the jewelry box?","response":"DM: The jewelry box has largely gold rings, a few gold earrings, the overall worth of the jewelry in there from what you can ascertain given the time that you were spending with it and your experience with having to hock and pawn things that you've acquired over your travels, you could probably sell everything in the jewelry box for about 150 gold."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is any of it, you know, magical?","response":"DM: No, there are no magical implements of it. It is purely just a jewelry box for Tylieri's own collection."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm keeping the jewelry box, 'cause I want it.","response":"DM: Okay. It is a nice jewelry box."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And I'll add the 150 to our party funds.

We did leave town.\nLIAM: I don't know, it's an unknown quantity.\nTALIESIN: Well, I have some heavy lifting on my shoulders, I'll take a bit of it on now.\nTRAVIS: I'll go with him.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}

Looks at the both of you, looks past and sees the rest of the group a little ways back, looks at the guard companion at the front of the gate, and goes, “That can be arranged, just no funny business. The moment you do, this entire district's gonna be down on your head.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We have no intention of anything funny.","response":"DM: “Good, good.” He puts his thumb up, and you hear the chains (rattling) and the portcullis begins to lift that leads into the central area of the Cloudtop District. You guys step back into the familiar area, the streets here much cleaner, the cobblestone much fresher– this is where the more upper-class and elite of Emon stay, live, and keep most of their business. You make your way through with the two guards flanking you guys, and you can see four more coming down from nearby parts of the wall, and flank you guys from the back to make sure that you're encased and taken care of. As you walk through the streets, what turned out to be an arrival is almost a procession, as individuals are now coming out and seeing this group of you guys walking through the street and peek out. Some of the local nobles and such, some seem to recognize you and go “Oh!” and dart back in. There was a woman you spoke to a couple years ago, it was an older, spinster-type woman who was planning a wedding for her daughter. She waves for a second and goes to talk to you guys real fast, and then one of the guards raises a pike towards her and goes “Mmm.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Later, later. It's going to be fine.\nLAURA: I can read lips.","response":"DM: You can."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What do they say?\nTALIESIN: Touché.\nLIAM: I see a guard I recognize and I go: “Oh, I got my snake!”","response":"DM: And he goes: “Oh, ha, yeah, good.” And another guy pats him on the shoulder and he puts his spear back in place."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: See, everything's fine, it's a lovely welcoming party.\nLIAM: I'm thoroughly impressed.","response":"DM: The throne doors open, entering the skylight– the noonday sun now pouring beams of light into the central chamber. You can see, stepping towards the central dais is Uriel Tal'Dorei, who has not been there previously, and apparently has been recently summoned to the chamber through your arrival. As he steps up and sits in his chair, he notices you guys entering with the guards, and nods his head for a moment and looks off to the side, and approaching him to join him on top of the platform is Seeker Asum, who apparently has returned, with his shaven halfling head, with his tattoos on the side, and Arbiter Brom, the cleric of Ioun who oversaw part of your guys' initial trial here in the castle chambers–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ooh, yeah, yeah, he was under their control, I think.","response":"DM: And then after them, you see Guardian Tofor Brotorus, who is the silver-scaled female dragonborn, who is currently the head of the town's guard."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Tofor, what was her last name?","response":"DM: Brotorus."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Man, I need to organize my notes better. Got it all written down somewhere.\nMARISHA: So this is essentially our jury? Judge? Judgment party?","response":"DM: It's most of it, from the last time you guys were here, yeah. As you guys are brought forward, the guards stop, and let you continue the rest of your pathway forward, you step up to the–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I step up.","response":"DM: Okay, is Percival the only one that's gonna step up?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I stay with him.\nLAURA: Wait, what are you doing?\nTALIESIN: I'm stepping up.\nLAURA: I'll step up behind you.\nLIAM: I pull her a little further along with me, and we step up.","response":"DM: As those of you who wish to then step up to the front of the dais, Uriel sits up and puts his hand out to tell you to stop where you are."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I genuflect.\nLAURA: I follow suit.\nSAM: By what?","response":"DM: “By a mob. All official documentation in Wildemount on the Briarwoods was set in this day, and that we the end of their line. However, this information was kept from ever making its way across the shore, as there isn't a lot of business between Wildemount and Emon. Upon doing more digging, in Port Damali, months later, it seemed that individuals matching their appearance appeared briefly within the Port, where they bought a ship and hired a crew. Now there was no political knowledge in Wildemount, or any approval of a bridge being built, either. This announcement from the Briarwoods, whom had previously been silent, came about the time that I'd sent two of my gatherers to look around, and never returned. I theorized that this entire presentation to Emon, and these political handshakes, were a means to avoid suspicion. I don't know what to, or to what means, but the timing seemed a bit conspicuous to me. Those were my findings in Wildemount, and based on our last discussion, it appears that Lord Briarwood seemed to contain some semblance of mind-affecting prowess. I myself befell to it, as did our Sovereign here. Thankfully, it came to its end recently.” And you can see there's a nod and a deep sigh of guilt that emanates from Uriel. Anyway, that is the gist of my findings while you were off in Whitestone. Sovereign.” And he steps back, and Uriel raises his head, leaning forward with his elbows on the edge of his knees, still sitting on his throne. “It's also been brought to my attention that the attack within my walls was indeed instigated by the Briarwoods  themselves, and that Sylas is vampiric in nature. This is the influence that clouded me. This is twice now that I have found myself, in spite of all of my protections and intents to defend this city, that I have fallen prey to the wills and whims of some infernal intent. And that is not a way to breed respect or trust in one's leader. I have a lot to think about. Regardless, let it stand that as of this moment, Vox Machina is immediately returned to their place on the council, and all charges against them dropped.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah! Sorry.","response":"DM: “So. We've also received a bit of word that you were successful in returning Whitestone to some semblance of new order. Please, if you would.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: If you would, your majesty, yes, first of all Whitestone is once again ruled by the de Rolo family.","response":"DM: “It is good to know.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And I must also, at this point, offer our own apologies which are in order. While there was a supernatural flame of distrust in your heart, it couldn't have been ignited without the embers of our own rash judgements, and poor choices. It is difficult for men of action to necessarily pay attention to the smaller details of their world and their realities, and for this we do apologize. I wish I could say it would be the last of it, but again, it is a difficult world, and we are prone to action, and for that you have our apologies. I would also offer, my lord, that perhaps these infernal powers are attracted by your innate goodness, and that would be worth meditating upon.","response":"DM: “I appreciate your counsel, Percival. (sighs) Well, if there is the de Rolos still in rule, then are you to return to Whitestone?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I am not. There is another de Rolo. The Briarwoods were sloppy in their extermination of my line and family. Cassandra de Rolo now rules, along with a–\nSAM: Triumvirate?\nTALIESIN: Triumvirate, I suppose?\nSAM: Council?\nTALIESIN: Council of leaders pushing to build the economy once again, in that sense I'm sure they would be delighted by the opening of trade, and perhaps continuing with the plans for a bridge. Worth discussing at the very least with the new rulers of Whitestone.","response":"DM: “We will, very much, endeavor to extend as much aid as we can to the rebuilding of Whitestone. As to the bridge, this may be more of a matter of us working with the powers of Wildemount, as we were under the impression that that was being handled by the Briarwoods. But we shall pursue this, as this would still be a great boon to our countryside. Well, thank you, thank you for coming.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Excuse me, Sovereign Uriel, perhaps I'm speaking out of turn here, and I haven't consulted with my fellows here, but you did mention that you've been mind-controlled twice now, and as council members, this doesn't sit well, and–","response":"DM: “I understand.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, what are we to do? The security that you have in place clearly hasn't worked. Is there a role that we can serve to ensure that you will be further protected?\nLIAM: If I may, Vox Machina would not be here today without the aid and advice of Lady Allura, and I would like to personally testify on her behalf of her ability and her wisdom, and her heart. I feel she has a great place in this city, and you should put great trust in her, specifically. She will do much good by you,\nSovereign.\nLAURA: Plus they may be able to enchant your crown so it has some, you know, special mind-control fighting abilities.\nSAM: She's spit-balling here, it doesn't have to be that.\nLAURA: Just, you know, throwing out some ideas. That's all.\nTRAVIS: That could be nice. Yeah.","response":"DM: “This is being looked into, as previously was thought that such an enchantment was already provided. It appears the magic went inert, and a re-enchantment is being looked into. And your advisement on Allura's great deal of respect, influence, has been noted, as it has for the entirety of her length here as part of the council. When she returns from Whitestone, I intend to see that she is properly rewarded and regarded in this forum.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: My mother would have said she is a good egg.","response":"DM: “That she is. That she is.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Should we hand over the rest of our–\nSAM: Evidence? Documents for the archives. We did collect quite a bit of paperwork, and documentation that would fill in any of the gaps in the history of Whitestone, and–","response":"DM: He leans forward and puts his hand out. “Please, anything–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Of course, we gathered this from the palace in Whitestone.","response":"DM: Thumbing through the paperwork. “It's not– Asum.” He hands it over and Asum takes a moment of quiet to himself to thumb through, and he's very carefully inspecting and looking about the edges."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are you looking for something specific?","response":"DM: “I'm currently confirming handwriting. One that I deal with quite often.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, yes, actually, that is something we discovered on our own.","response":"DM: “My liege, these papers do appear to be genuine, and that does indeed appear to be the handwriting of Riskel Daxio.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, sorry.","response":"DM: Uriel takes the papers back and, “It's not– he's been at my side since I was young. His father, Mikael, helms our forces at Fort Daxio. Guards! Find and seize Riskel Daxio at once.” The guards immediately go to action, bringing their weapons and scattering outside of the throne room. You can hear the clanging of footsteps, heavy footfalls, and weapons and shields banging as they start just scattering about the entire palace around you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hate to be him right now.\nSAM: Did you just say that there's a fort somewhere?\nMARISHA: Fort Daxio?","response":"DM: “Fort Daxio. It's our northern military post. It's by the Cliffkeep Mountains. Lots of very dangerous things reside up there, giant creatures, and he holds the border. He's the adopted father of Riskel, not his actual–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: But any connection to this traitor may– it may be dangerous for him to be in command up there. This whole place could be a risk.","response":"DM: “I shall look into it. They haven't spoken in quite a long time, and as far as I know there wasn't a lot of love between the two. Besides, Mikael is not at the Fort right now, Mikael is down in Syngorn on a diplomatic military mission.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Your majesty, I know well the betrayal you feel, and I urge caution.","response":"DM: “Caution it is.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Don't forget about Kibble.\nLAURA: Oh, that's right, I guess we don't need him to testify–\nSAM: Well we should bring him out just to, just 'cause– Otherwise he just sat around for nothing.","response":"DM: You look behind and Desmond is standing behind you all, wide-eyed and so confused and overwhelmed by everything that's happening, and just eagerly awaiting for you to fill him in–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This young man was an unfortunate victim of my wrath when the Briarwoods visited. He is a citizen of Whitestone, and–","response":"DM: “Yes, yes I was told of this, the carriage-man that you had attacked.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I would like to have him be the official letter carrier for any– the first set of correspondence to the new rulers of Whitecastle, so since he–\nSAM: Stone.\nTALIESIN: Whitestone. My god, I'm hungry.\nLIAM: Oh no! So if you could send an order of sliders–\nTALIESIN: About 12.\nMARISHA: Don't forget the mustard.\nTALIESIN: I'm coming up with this shit. It's not easy.\nTRAVIS: Might need some gut healing after those.\nTALIESIN: I know. Constitution roll.\n(fart noise)\nTALIESIN: Would it be reasonable to appoint him as our first correspondence messenger, since he must return home at the very least?","response":"DM: “Yes. I would still wish to send him with a few of our trusted soldiers to keep him safe. The roads are not safe between here and Whitestone in general, and I mean no offense to you, young sir, but you don't look able with a weapon.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Especially not against harpies.\nTALIESIN: I should also mention that my lineage has now been restored to me, and I am now of royal descent once again. And so, again, with my companions'  permission, and we will discuss this in the future, but I would like to put forward the beginnings of the proper paperwork to perhaps have Greyskull Keep designated as an embassy, with all the privileges and rights that that presumes.\nASHLEY: What does that mean?","response":"DM: “That could, no, that will be arranged.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I will confer with my peers.\nLIAM: You're on Whitestone soil.\nSAM: Before we give Desmond his appointment as a royal messenger, which I guess he is, would the kingdom– he risked much to keep himself alive and possibly to testify on our behalf– would the kingdom be willing to give him a quick little reward for his time spent in captivity?","response":"DM: Make a persuasion roll."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Not great. 24.","response":"DM: Not great."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, come on.","response":"DM: He gives a nod and looks to Desmond. “Certainly. It's only fair. You've travelled this far and undergone much personal difficulty in aiding us and relieving this darkness in our territory, and yours as well. I would like to grant upon him by my estate as Sovereign Uriel a granted gift of 1,000 gold pieces to be sent on his way.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: That's more than what we would've done by far!","response":"DM: Desmond's like: “I-I–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Don't faint!\nMARISHA: Don't spend it all in one place, bruh.\nTALIESIN: Desmond? The debt that I owe you is larger than coin, and is–","response":"DM: “That's a lot of coins, huh?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And it's ongoing, so if you can think of how– what sort of trade you would like to spend your next years of life pursuing, whether it be in–\nLAURA: Probably not lute-playing, I'm gonna just throw that out there.\nTALIESIN: Drums it is! Drums it is.\nTRAVIS: Holy shit.\nTALIESIN: You are a terrible person. I'm a terrible person, but you're the worst.\nTRAVIS: Even I am taken aback. My jaw is just open like: (gasps).","response":"DM: There's an awkward tense pause for a moment as everyone looks over to Vex, including Uriel. Seeker Asum stifles a chuckle."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do you know what's amazing, Sovereign, is that Vex'ahlia and Percival were just talking earlier today and they promised each other to match whatever you offered this boy, and I am amazed at their generosity and kindness–\nLAURA: I walk rocks hand him, on the back of his arm, just like that.","response":"DM: Uriel nods, “That is generous.” At which point, two–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Whatever work you would wish, Desmond, is available to you.","response":"DM: Two guards rush in at this point, and whisper something into his ear, which, Vex, you see their lips moving, as that's what you can do. The verbiage comes across as– actually, no."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh! Oh oh! The first whisper of 2016!\nTALIESIN: Breaking in the new year!\nMARISHA: Watch the flask.\nLIAM: “I'm making this up as I go! I don't know what I'm doing.”\nTALIESIN: “Look surprised!”\nSAM: “I'm a fraud!”\nTALIESIN: “I've got a reddit page open behind my DM screen.”\nLAURA: Of course.\nSAM: Is there anything else we need or require?\nTALIESIN: I think we're perfectly well-suited for now.\nLIAM: Is Desmond off to Whitestone?","response":"DM: Desmond nods. “I imagine so.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, Vex'ahlia, you'd best give him that 1,000 gold now–\nLAURA: I would right now, but I don't have any on me, how crazy is that?\nTRAVIS: Oh that is such a shame, I know, I almost thought about reminding you to bring your extra–\nTALIESIN: Since I am also gold-poor, I'm writing it into the letter to my sister that we owe money, that they are to employ him in any way he sees fit.","response":"DM: An individual of the Court has just come up and handed him a sack of gold coins and he hasn't even– he's not listening to you."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hide it around. Put some in your shorts, put some in your shoes–\nTRAVIS: Yeah, tuck it down by your nuts, eh?","response":"DM: He puts some down the front of his pants and pulls his little belt tight. “I-I, um–”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Keeps it safe, makes a lady take a double look.\nTALIESIN: I also made sure in the letter that they know that he is returning to Whitestone with this money, so that if he, somehow– if it's mismanaged by any of the guards or otherwise that it will be taken care of.","response":"DM: He is escorted by two of the guards to his temporary chambers here at the palace."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Uriel, we'll leave you to your business, but if you need any help finding anyone, we're here for you.","response":"DM: Thinks for a minute. “I know you just returned. You've already done so much. But it has come to my attention that Riskel Daxio apparently has fled the palace, or at least has not been seen for a number of days. I've set the guards on it, and Seeker Asum, you as well, see if you can gather as much information as you can– but if you find it within your capabilities to seek any information regarding his whereabouts and possibly bring him to justice, I would be very grateful and happy to reward for the destruction of this traitor.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course.\nSAM: Do you have any intelligence that he's still within the city walls, or?","response":"DM: “It's only been a few days, so, I haven't, no–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Could be anywhere.","response":"DM: “We're trying to find out now. You may move swifter than my guard, if previous experience has taught me anything.” He looks over to some of his guards who are like, what?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: “Ah sir, we're standing right here!”\nTALIESIN: You guys are doing a great job, you're great, you look great, you're doing great, you're great, thank you.\nLIAM: “Man, we ain't found shit.”","response":"DM: At this point, Guardian Tofor reaches over and says, “My liege, if I might also be excused to do my own search, I would appreciate that.” “But of course, Guardian, please, go on your way.” And she scatters off. The rest of the council looks about, and glances at the rest of you. Uriel stands up from his throne, “Very well. Thank you, and you're all dismissed from this council meeting.” And he stands up and begins walking off with Seeker Asum at his side, quickly talking up to him and they're both having this heated discussion as they leave out to the western side of the throne room."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Are there any other guards in the room as we leave?","response":"DM: There are four other guards, two appointed to the front door and there are two at the sides of the central throne."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I look at the guards at the door and I go, told ya!","response":"DM: They both step back for a minute from the booming voice out of nowhere, and, “Yeah.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That went well.\nLAURA: Better than I expected, to be sure.\nTRAVIS: I wasn't worried. Who are we tracking down?\nLAURA: The dickhead that built our frigging keep!\nMARISHA: Yeah, you know, I'm wondering: if I was a sneaky bastard–\nSAM: You're not, don't say that about yourself.\nMARISHA: Thank you so much. I sometimes get concerned.\nTALIESIN: I know where you're going with this, you should finish the thought.\nMARISHA: If I was a sneaky bastard, and I wanted to make sure–\nSAM: You're not.\nLAURA: Yeah, I mean he's built– he's built a lot, but I assume he's probably built secret entrances into different places.\nMARISHA: Because our keep is butted up against the border of the city and everywhere else.\nTALIESIN: Do we have the blueprints to Greyskull Keep?\nMARISHA: Yeah, can we get them?\nTRAVIS: They won't be on there.\nTALIESIN: No, but being able to study them we might find places where–\nSAM: You're thinking that he's hiding in our keep somewhere?\nMARISHA: No, I think he escaped through our keep.\nTALIESIN: Or he might have hidden an escape– there might be things about our keep we don't know.\nLIAM: I mean, could I take a week and really size up the entire building?","response":"DM: Which building?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The keep. For little sneaky holes that I didn't know were there.\nTALIESIN: We'll get the blueprints just to help.\nTRAVIS: Did we even ask where we last saw Riskel whatever?\nLAURA: Can I search his room? Are we allowed to do that? I mean, he did ask–\nMARISHA: Yeah, can we ask for transparency and information exchange or something like that with these people? So that we can come in and out of the Cloudtop District? Are we cool there?","response":"DM: You're cool now. Yeah, all the charges have been dropped."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're representatives of a foreign government.\nMARISHA: Okay, cool. So here's my other question. The Briarwoods wanted something with Emon. That had nothing to do with building a bridge, right?\nTALIESIN: What did they want?\nMARISHA: What did they want?","response":"DM: Seeker Asum found information that it seems that the whole bridge conversation–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Was like a ruse?","response":"DM: It was a ruse that arose– well, it arose because he began to send agents into Whitestone to find out what was happening, and he believes they discovered that Emon was now looking at them, and so they reached out to try and distract or prevent them from going any further. So as opposed to being just quiet and accepting this outside attention, they cut it off at the head and went like, “Hey! Let's talk about how we can work together as a way to try and not keep this weird, constant influx of spies.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So the Briarwoods coming to Emon is assumed to be just a formality? That's all they were here for?\nTRAVIS: A distraction.","response":"DM: To continue to raise belief in that conversation. It may not be the case, but that was–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: But why send– why would I go? Why would you go? Why not send a representative? You know what I mean?\nLAURA: So you can gain better control.\nTRAVIS: So you can work your magic.\nLIAM: Validity.\nLAURA: Anyway, I want to go check out his room.","response":"DM: Okay. Riskel was also in charge of security within the palace. And part of the notes that you had received about him talked about discussing back and forth with the Briarwoods in preparation for their arrival, to make sure that most of the magical wards and defenses that were usually set up there were all removed or false."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait a second, so we're gonna go check out his room to see if we can find clues, but also, who would know? Is there anyone that we know who would know– would Gilmore know where this guy has gone?\nTALIESIN: You just really want to see Gilmore.\nLAURA: Why would Gilmore know?\nSAM: Because he knows everything about everyone.\nTALIESIN: He just has really nice hair.\nSAM: Isn't that the same thing?\nTALIESIN: It's different from actually knowing things.\nLIAM: I honestly think that if Asum doesn't know, nobody knows. Asum is our source of information here.\nMARISHA: Well you know what they say when you Asum.\nLAURA: He's just staring at you.\nLAURA: Council members coming through.\nSAM: Take five.","response":"DM: The guards stop rummaging as you enter. You can see cabinets and stuff have been pulled out, bedsheets have been turned over. Most of the room appears to have been left untouched, except for most of his belongings– anything that would have worth is empty. Most of his drawers are empty. You can see already, there is what looks to be a small chest that is open and empty on the ground."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, I'm gonna perception check that shit.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm gonna perception check the whole room to see–","response":"DM: Make an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And I'm going to look for secret compartments in the wall.\nLIAM: Investigation, you said?","response":"DM: For investigating these specific things for this purpose, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 19 for me.\nLAURA: 23 for me.","response":"DM: Okay. Inspecting the room, you find– the chest that you're looking at currently, Vax, it has scrapes on the inside that look like it contained a great sum of money, that was then removed and taken, as if pretty much a large portion of his personal wealth was removed. That's your inspection check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay.","response":"DM: You, looking about the room, Vex, you find that the arrangement of the furniture seems to have these glyphs that are inscribed on certain pieces of his furniture that are reminiscent of some of the glyphs that you saw–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: In a teleportation circle?","response":"DM: No, actually, on the ziggurat. There are symbols that are concurrent with some of the writings that you saw inscribed up there. You can't read it, necessarily, and they don't appear to be enchanted by any means, at least not anymore, but there is– it appears like there was something about this room that was purposely arranged for some sort of arcane purpose."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What are you gasping about? You sound perturbed.\nLAURA: Oh. The glyphs, I saw them at the ziggurat. Keyleth, Pike, do you know anything about–","response":"DM: Anyone who wants to take a shot at arcane, I would recommend those who are proficient, because it's pretty deep knowledge."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I can't do the arcane thing.\nSAM: I'll do an arcane check.\nTRAVIS: Yep, me as well.\nSAM: Grog is an expert on all things.\nLIAM: Natural 20, Grog.\nASHLEY: Oh! Natural 20!\nTALIESIN: I wanna see how this pulls together.\nSAM: I'm very well-travelled and very old.","response":"DM: You're trying to find out what the connection to this is. You've seen parts of this arrangement before, and while the runes are different, there is something about the way they're arranged that reminds you of something, and Grog, you immediately remember that the last time that your party tried to scry into somewhere that didn't want to be scryed in, and it was either aggressively ousted or prevented from any sort of intrusion–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The beholder.","response":"DM: It's the same type of arrangement in here. Something about this just says, “This room doesn't want you to look at it.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Right, yeah, it's funny, but like the pictures that were on the big shape, right, there's something about it that reminds me with this arrangement of that time that we fought that shit-head beholder. Yeah, like, it doesn't really want us to look in it.\nLAURA: Is this like an anti-scrying glyph set?","response":"DM: Having a look at it now that you've been given the guidance from Grog, the all-arcane-seeing barbarian–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: His instincts are just right there.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, it's just a feral thing, you know.","response":"DM: He's very good at finding the memory. But that helps guide you to the knowledge and understanding, and immediately that is it. These glyphs were, while no longer having power because an element of them was taken or damaged in the process, this room was guarded against scrying, very subtly, but essentially preventing anyone from peering into Riskel's private goings-on and anything he was doing within his personal delvings with the Briarwoods was all kept from being peered into."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do I know what kind of magic or what kind of magic wielder would have been able to protect this room or design this protection?","response":"DM: Pretty much any caster of a decent, mediocre skill for casting can be done, and it's not a terribly uncommon enchantment, it's just expensive."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Do we have any idea when the letters came in to Emon that we were successful?","response":"DM: Which ones? You sent different ones at different times."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Either or. When did they get them, do we know? Can we find that information?","response":"DM: The letter that you guys had sent that just absolved you of your stuff that you had sealed, that was sent closer to Winter's Crest, and that has not arrived yet. The one that you sent to Allura, regarding the inspection of the ziggurat–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yes, that one.","response":"DM: That arrived about a week and a half ago, so– that arrived a lot sooner because you sent it a lot sooner, and Allura's already left, and apparently has gone to seek some allies to help her–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And it's been about three days since they've seen Riskel?","response":"DM: About three days, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And did we find anything else, any hidden compartments or anything?","response":"DM: No hidden compartments throughout the room throughout your search, no."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I go outside?","response":"DM: Yeah. You step outside of the room."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I wanna do a– no, outside. Dirt. I want dirt under me.","response":"DM: Okay. You're gonna have to walk out on the actual palace into the courtyard area that's around the front."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, bye, Keyleth.\nMARISHA: I'll be right back! I'll be right back, I'm not gonna, I'll be right back.\nSAM: I think she has to drop a D. With that expression–\nMARISHA: I just like the bushes better.\nTRAVIS: Is there a guard outside of the room?","response":"DM: Yeah, there are two guards outside of the room, and there are the two guards that have stood back and let you guys go about your business."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Should we try and shake one down, and ask who was the last person to see him?\nLAURA: Why do we need to shake him down, hey!\nTRAVIS: Because it's what I do.\nLAURA: Do you know the last time– who the last person was that saw this gentleman?","response":"DM: “As far as we know, last he was seen was a few days ago. His servant, actually, who's currently being interrogated, two rooms down, will probably have more information.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What was the servant's name?","response":"DM: “This would be–” Hold on, let me pull this up real fast."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: The guard just keeps notes.","response":"DM: The guard goes through all of his notes here."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: He's got two pieces of toilet paper with charcoal on it.","response":"DM: “Jeffrey.”"}
{"prompt":"ALL: Jeffrey.\nSAM: He's being interrogated right now?\nTRAVIS: I immediately leave the room.\nSAM: Yeah, yeah, let's go do that.\nTALIESIN: I follow Grog.\nTRAVIS: You two. Leave.","response":"DM: The two guards immediately step away and leave the room. Do you enter with him?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I do.\nLAURA: Good cop, bad cop?\nLIAM: Grog's the good cop. Look at his face.\nTRAVIS: I take out Craven Edge. And I put it, unsheathed, next to my foot.","response":"DM: As it slams into the wood, it sinks about an inch, as the blade just slips into the wooden floor. And you can see, you guys, as he pulls it out and sets it to his side, almost like mist off of a very hot, wet surface. You can see shadow just drifting off the blade ever so slightly."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You know, there are those that protect life, and they just left. Now, whatever me and my mates are gonna ask, you're going to answer honestly, or your life will be forfeit.","response":"DM: “Right, um. I–”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Don't talk unless you're asked a question. My little mate over here will begin.\nSAM: Jeffrey, is it?","response":"DM: “Aye.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Jeffrey–","response":"DM: “Yeah?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: He doesn't want to use the sword.","response":"DM: “I don't want him to.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: He doesn't like to use the sword. It's a lot to clean, there's brains on it. He likes to keep it nice and tidy in here. This isn't even our palace. Don't make him use the sword.","response":"DM: “Oh no. I don't want him to.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Pipe to smoke or anything? Just anything to relax you, make you feel better.","response":"DM: “No, I'm okay.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: When was the last time you saw Riskel?","response":"DM: “That would be three and a half days ago. He took most of his belongings and packed them up for a trip. He said he'd be back within a month.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Insight check that bitch.\nTRAVIS: I'll do it as well. 16?","response":"DM: He seems to be bewildered, fearful, and not holding back any information. He's just at a point where he doesn't seem quite sure what else to say."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Uh-oh, sorry, Jeffrey. He's not gonna like using that sword, but it looks like it's coming.","response":"DM: “Please don't. No, no, no, no no. No, no, no. You don't have to–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: The sword is moving a little, isn't it?\nTRAVIS: Spinning it. Spinning it now. On the tip.","response":"DM: “Three days he left, he said he'd be gone for a month, I-I don't know where– he left! He-he-he walked right out of the Cloudtop District.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Where did he say he was gonna go?","response":"DM: “He didn't tell me. He didn't.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh boy, this is gonna be a hard night for me, I'm gonna have to talk him down from this, he gets so worked up–\nTRAVIS: I just got it clean, I just got it clean.","response":"DM: “I don't know!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Jeffrey, please, you're just gonna make more work for me if you– if he has to behead you right now, please.","response":"DM: “Don't behead me. I just met a girl, please don't–”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I mean I know the answers are inside you. If I have to open you up to get to 'em I will.","response":"DM: “No, there's no answers to find! I'm empty! I–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Jeffrey, Jeffrey, did your boss get any letters that he stowed away anywhere, did he have a safe-keeping place, a secret residence somewhere in the city walls–","response":"DM: “He had a chest, but he took everything out, he left. I don't know! I don't know!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Did he ever regularly travel to anywhere in the walls of the city?","response":"DM: “Uh– he um–”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I walk up and stand right next to him.","response":"DM: “I um– I-I-I-I escorted him once or twice to the– to the Graveyard District.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Where specifically?","response":"DM: “Uh, it was uh. It was a-a tavern– it was far, far beneath him. I found it curious that he would attend.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: The tavern's name?","response":"DM: “Uh, it was um…”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I lay the sword right on the table and look at the reflection.","response":"DM: “The Diamond Nest Tavern! That's the one! The Diamond Nest Tavern! He went there, I assumed to do what young-ish elven men do when they're in stuffy work. I don't know! I don't know, I didn't go inside.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: How often did he go into the Diamond Nest Tavern?\nSAM: This is our sergeant.","response":"DM: “Not often! A few times every few months.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Did it follow some sort of regular schedule or was it just out of the blue?","response":"DM: “No, not that I recall. He– every six months or so… uh, a few times recently, in the past month, but that was, that was all.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I feel this has been very helpful.\nSAM: Yes, yes, you have been quite helpful… Give us the name of that girl so we can send our condolences to her?","response":"DM: “No no no no no! Please please please don't–” He's just weeping now, openly, like this–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, not on the blade, not on the blade…","response":"DM: You hear a voice in your head go, “No, keep the tears coming.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What?\nTRAVIS: What? Yeah. How are you?\nTALIESIN: I'm fine. I just want to check in, to see how you're doing.\nSAM: Jeffrey, is there anything else that might help us in our search for your former employer?","response":"DM: (whimpering) “Don't kill me.” He's lost at this point."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Lost. Okay…\nTALIESIN: The sword is a bit iffy…\nSAM: Grog, what do you think?","response":"DM: “End its torture. End its measly life.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can you see in this room right now?","response":"DM: “I can see everything you can see.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What? I was saying, can you see in this room right now. Can you see what's happening in this room right now? We are totally intimidating the shit out of– Jeffrey?","response":"DM: (whimpering) “Yes!”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do you see what's happening in the– (whispering loudly) Shut the fuck up!\nSAM: Grog, what do you think? Should we let him live?\nTRAVIS: Well, I suppose. He's been pretty helpful. (yelling) Haven't you, Jeffrey?! And I hold it right under his chin.","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a wisdom check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my god! You're gonna kill him!","response":"DM: Oh I'm sorry, a wisdom saving throw."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Saving throw?!\nLAURA: Jeez Louise.\nLIAM: You're a terrible person.\nTRAVIS: 14?","response":"DM: 14! For a moment, the shadows begin to surround you, and you feel the urge to push the blade right through his measly little throat. But you see the face. But it's not his face: it's the face of Pike right next to you looking up at you with this–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Grog!","response":"DM: – and you pull yourself out for a second, and the blade comes back instinctively."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Have a good day! And remember, shop at Gilmore's Glorious Goods!","response":"DM: “Okay! I will! I will!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Trinket goes up and licks his face.","response":"DM: (yelps)"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We should give him something. Ah, fuck him.","response":"DM: As you guys all walk out of there, you hear in the back of your head, Grog, this long, rumbling, deep, unhappy sigh."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We should go check out this tavern, then.\nSAM: Yes, we should. Maybe get a drink there?\nLAURA: Yeah. And maybe go to the bathroom there.\nMARISHA: Well, I'm out in the courtyard.","response":"DM: Yes. Now getting to Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I want to do a Commune with Nature spell.","response":"DM: That got weird."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This is what happens when you spend time on your phone.\nMARISHA: Is Riskel anywhere in town?","response":"DM: As you're connecting, you feel your mind reach out to the earth itself, to all the plant life that exists beneath and through the cracks of the cobblestones. The few trees that are peppered throughout the city, keeping arduous watch over the goings-on within the city of Emon, and a single thought comes back to you that says, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, shit. I mean, I'm not there.\nMARISHA: Can I take my second question to focus a little harder and figure out where in town he is?\nLAURA: What a good idea. Good idea!\nMARISHA: Thanks!","response":"DM: Your vision casts through and brings towards the outskirts of the Graveyard District. It brings you to a series of buildings, one building in particular, but not within, beneath. And the vision fades."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's at the tavern, right? I mean.\nTRAVIS: Or is he a fucking vampire?\nLAURA: Oh my gosh.\nMARISHA: Vision fades? That's all I got?","response":"DM: Yeah. He's beneath the tavern. That tavern–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So I get one more question?","response":"DM: You do."}
{"prompt":"SAM: How and when will I die?\nLAURA: 42.\nMARISHA: Can I see any type of underground secret tunnels or passageways that lead out of the city? What?","response":"DM: You have a brief vision. There are a number of tunnels that snake underneath the city, many of which are long-collapsed or destroyed. You do know there are a handful that spill out towards the docks, deep beneath the city itself."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Smugglers.","response":"DM: You're hard-pressed to find specific locations, but one of them does seem to drift near the location of the tavern you were previously given a vision of."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay. Cool beans.","response":"DM: Nature fades from your grasp, and suddenly your consciousness returns to just your simple form of Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Keyleth!\nMARISHA: Ah! What!\nSAM: Keyleth, we found a lot of information by scaring an innocent boy. We need to go to the Graveyard District for some reason.\nLAURA: There's a tavern!\nMARISHA: That's funny, I found the same thing, but I just meditated for a minute.\nSAM: Shit.\nTALIESIN: That's not nearly as much fun.\nMARISHA: You know, I'm glad we got things that overlapped, though. That's good, I mean, it corroborates, exactly. Cool. Well, I found good news, Eskil, I mean, Riskel is still in town.\nLAURA: Really? Are you sure?\nMARISHA: I'm pretty sure. I got– his essence was floating in nature's ether, and nature told me he was here.\nLAURA: Where? At the tavern?\nMARISHA: In the Graveyard District, it seems like he's somewhere– I saw that– he's somewhere underground. Also, it looks like there is in fact quite a lot of tunnels and secret passageways that lead out of the city near there.\nSAM: You are amazing. Amazing.\nLIAM: Pike and I spent a bit of time underground in the Graveyard District with the Clasp, I don't know if the Thieves' Guild is connected–","response":"DM: This tavern, the Diamond Nest Tavern was the tavern that contained the secret entrance to the Clasp."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We busted in there!\nMARISHA: So we have been, I thought it sounded familiar.\nLAURA: Oh, shit.\nMARISHA: Wait, was this the same tavern, is this the one that's got, like–\nTALIESIN: Burt Reynolds?\nMARISHA: Right, is this the one that's also like a whorehouse? Is that that one?\nSAM: Aren't they all?\nTRAVIS: We're definitely going.","response":"DM: No, no, this one does not. You've only really been to it at the really wee hours of the morning when no one was there for the most part so you could sneak in and out. You have not been there during its normal operating business hours."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What time is it right now?","response":"DM: Right now, after all this conversation, I'd say it's pushing one, two o'clock in the afternoon."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go, plenty of time.\nLAURA: I think it's a perfect time to take a break and then–","response":"DM: I was about to get to that. Actually."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Somebody's about to bust.\nLAURA: Somebody needs to go to the bathroom.","response":"DM: Gotcha. Are you guys heading towards the Graveyard District?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We're heading.","response":"DM: Welcome back, guys. We've had a little break here, we're gonna go ahead and hop back into this chaos. So. As the party, Vox Machina, makes their way through Emon, the sun itself pushing towards about 2:30, three o'clock in the afternoon. You make your way towards the Graveyard District, and there to the familiar–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Wait! On the way, can I throw something in here? Halfway there I go: Argh! Oh my foot. Pike! Come here! and I pull her off to the side. We'll catch up, we'll catch up.\nLAURA: What?! What's wrong with your stupid foot?\nLIAM: I take the insults and I wait 'til they all march on.\nASHLEY: I take the insults, and I continue.\nLIAM: Used to it, used to it. Pike. I had a front row seat to the Briarwoods, and that blade that Grog has now that we have never seen before came off of Sylas Briarwood.\nASHLEY: I thought something was wrong.\nLIAM: It makes me nervous. I don't know why other than it looks big and fucking scary. I thought about talking to him myself but he will just kick me in the goolies, so I thought that I would tell you, because I think he would listen to you, he certainly would–\nASHLEY: Did you see the stuff coming off the–\nLIAM: Yeah, it kind of reminded me of Percival's shit, which is why I'm talking to you now.\nASHLEY: Well, that makes me stressed.\nLIAM: But he likes you! Not so much me.\nASHLEY: I'll talk to him, and see maybe if… I don't know, I'm gonna check out the sword and see if maybe–\nLAURA: What's that sound? Is somebody popping popcorn?!\nMARISHA: Yeah, I think they are. I think they're eating popcorn. I can hear it.\nTRAVIS: There's a street vendor on the way to the tavern that's, yep.\nLIAM: Anyway, that's it.\nASHLEY: Okay. Thanks for letting me know. Fist bump.\nTRAVIS: (belches)\nLIAM: I'm gonna throw up my hood, and I'm gonna pull out my other cloak, the red one, and I'm putting it over Pike, putting the hood over Pike's head.\nLAURA: You have two extra cloaks? You gave me one and then you have another one?\nTRAVIS: It's like Dumb and Dumber with the gloves.","response":"DM: Which cloak are you giving her, then?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, the Mountebank.","response":"DM: Okay. And you're keeping which one?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The displacer cloak I've been wearing. I just don't want you to be seen.\nASHLEY: Am I invisible?\nTRAVIS: Just say yes! Just say yes!\nSAM: Where's Pike? Where did Pike go?\nASHLEY: Hey! Nobody can see me!\n(clanking noises)","response":"DM: Your features are better hidden by this cloak, just because it's big and not currently designed for someone of your stature."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You gotta pull it round your cheeks.\nMARISHA: I was gonna say, what does the clientele of the bar look like?","response":"DM: Well, as you guys step inside, the clientele here appears to be regular; the equivalent of like a blue-collar work staff, like, a lot of folks that are you know, sleeves rolled up to the elbows, dirt on the face, gentlemen who are part of either construction crews, or stone workers, masonry, probably work within the actual district in the process of moving plots, or building, you know, small mausoleums, things like that within the actual confines of the district. You see across the way there's a live band playing, of which, you know, they're no one really of note at first, however, Scanlan, you do recognize two of the individuals on the far side of the bar. In the band. There is an individual named Kent Plucker, who is a halfling bard, currently on the lute, which you had traveled with previously, for quite some time along with the other individual you recognize, a rowdy-looking but well-dressed half-orc violinist named Dr. Dranzel."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Have we heard of these individuals and these–","response":"DM: You've heard whispers from Scanlan long ago about just his travel, but you don't speak–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: My troupe.\nLIAM: Oh, I forgot about Dran.\nTRAVIS: Oh! We forgot about Dre.\nLIAM: 60 seconds late, ladies and gentlemen.\nSAM: It's my troupe.\nASHLEY: This is amazing.\nSAM: It's my troupe!\nTRAVIS: Wanna go say hi?\nSAM: Of course I want to go say hi, but I don't want to distract us from our mission.\nLAURA: No no no, do your shit Scanlan, we'll just look around.\nASHLEY: How about you ask to jump in for a tune?\nMARISHA: Yeah, you know, we never get to see you play, Scanlan, not to your full capacity!\nLIAM: I plant my foot firmly into his arse and just shove him towards the two guys.\nSAM: I haven't seen them for a while. I don't know how they'll react to seeing me.\nSAM: Mind if I jump in?","response":"DM: “It would be an honor! Scanlan Shorthalt, ladies and gentlemen! Jump into the fray!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Let's play our old standard. And a oney and a twoey and a oney and a twoey.","response":"DM: What instrument do you pull out?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Vuvuzela.\nSAM: I'm gonna pull out the flute, the flute, I'm gonna play the flute for a while. 'Cause I don't wanna, the singer sounds good, I don't wanna rain on her parade.","response":"DM: Yeah, no worries. So you pull out your flute and other gnomish girl with her flute as well gives you a look, and you guys start weaving together this flute duel, almost like Flight of the Bumblebees but two conflicting sides– Go ahead and make a perform check if you could."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I've never done one of these before. Something tells me it might not go well.\nTRAVIS: It's gonna be great!\nMARISHA: I go and I get as many ales as I can carry and start handing them to those guys.","response":"DM: Okay. No worries."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 22.","response":"DM: As you guys begin to build this perpetual symphony of– it's almost jazz flute almost in this improvisational feel to it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: (flute noises)\nMARISHA: Here, have a drink. Yeah!\nLIAM: Another whisper. Two whispers!\nSAM: Jesus.\nSAM: Ashley is subtly massaging Laura's ass.\nASHLEY: For inspiration.\nLAURA: I keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn't– any of us.\nSAM: Can me and the other flutist end with an impossibly long held note?","response":"DM: Make another perform check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 33.\nSAM: Yes it has, sir, yes it has.","response":"DM: “Haven't lost your edge.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm a little rusty, but I trust you'll keep me honest through this.","response":"DM: “Honest? We've always been honest. Come! Drink. Eat with us.” And they all put their instruments up, as he says: “We've just finished our set. Let's catch up. It's been some time, I'd like to hear of your journeys and tell you of some of ours.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Absolutely. I'll be back in a while, fellows.\nASHLEY: Good job, Scanlan!","response":"DM: “Oh are these, are these your friends?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh yes, these are my traveling companions and–\nTRAVIS: I'm his bodyguard. He's very popular.","response":"DM: “You can afford a bodyguard of that magnitude?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, I've done quite well, thanks to your tutelage.","response":"DM: “Well great, great, well, come on, you don't all need to stay away! Have your friends sit with us.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: They can join us?","response":"DM: “Certainly!” He goes and calls over, he goes, “Kaylie, Zed, help me with the tables.” And the gnome and the rotund bearded human rush off and start grabbing a couple of the tables and they cram them in the corner, so now you basically have built this monopoly on the far corner of the tavern now, where all of you guys can sit around and cluster."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Kaylie, that was some fine playing. I might have a tip or two about breath control.","response":"DM: “Sorry, not all of us are quite as old and seasoned as the others.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, I've learned quite a thing or two in my years and, it might interest you to take a little private tutoring session sometime.","response":"DM: “Scanlan Shorthalt. You know, I've heard quite a bit about you.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: My legend is spread far and wide, I'm sure.","response":"DM: “Indeed. And I know better than most ladies that may cross your path.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You may change your “tune.”\n(noncommittal groans)\nSAM: Grog, a little help over here.\nLIAM: You had us, and then you lost us.\nASHLEY: Can I give him inspiration? Somehow?","response":"DM: How?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I don't know.","response":"DM: What would you like to do to make Scanlan look better in this circumstance?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Perhaps help him with his pitch.\nASHLEY: Yeah.\nSAM: It's lovely to meet you anyway.\nLIAM: Vex once helped Grog in a very specific way.\nASHLEY: I will– the man, the myth, and the legend, is true. So, in case you wanted to find out–","response":"DM: She gives you a look over, looks over at Scanlan."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yeah. Yeah that, we're close, we're tight, she and I and– she's come back for more.","response":"DM: “A holy woman?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh shit!\nSAM: She's got holes in all the right places.\n(groaning)\nSAM: I don't know what I'm doing here!\nSAM: “It was nice. What have you fellows been doing for these years?”\nSAM: Oh, well, thank you, but I can't possibly accept this.","response":"DM: “Fair enough!” And he scoops it back."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You deserve it. It's your gig, you booked it. I'm just playing here for the night.","response":"DM: “Ah, you're fine.” At this point, you guys notice a small halfling boy, definitely not an adult, probably in his late teens, comes up to the edge of the table, you know, big eyes and softer features, and he's dressed a little inconspicuously, comes up. “Doctor. Good performance, good performance.” and he claps and looks about the rest of the table. And Doctor's like, “It's fine, boy, they're friends.” At which point the boy nods, looks about the rest of you, lifts up a small satchel and unloads it on the table next to Dr. Dranzel, and you see spill out a much larger collection of coppers, silver, rings, bits of jewelry, a few loose coin purses, and Dr. Dranzel reaches over and pats him on the head. “Good boy, Samson, good boy.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice haul, Samson.","response":"DM: “Thanks,” and he looks about awkwardly and expectantly and—"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Still up to the old tricks, I see, Doctor.","response":"DM: “Hey, when business is good, Scanlan, when business is good.” And he reaches over and grabs a small bit of the gold coin and puts it into Samson's hands and goes, “Go buy yourself some toys,” and pats him on the back, and the boy runs off excitedly. He quickly looks about and takes a bunch of the gold and scoops it into a small satchel at his side and hands it off to Kaylie. Kaylie takes it. Kaylie, who at this point has been introduced as the gnomish girl who you saw her grabbing the table. She takes the satchel and whisks her hand for a moment and the satchel just vanishes in her grasp in a little puff of smoke."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I like this girl.","response":"DM: “Huh. So the company you're keeping seems to be formidable.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We are.","response":"DM: “What can we call you?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We call ourselves Vox Machina.","response":"DM: “Sounds really formal.”"}
{"prompt":"“That's the Scanlan I know. Shits it is. So, Shits, what do you do? What's your trade? What are you tugging around with this sorry sap for?”\nLAURA: Scanlan's a kingslayer.\nMARISHA: It's true.\nSAM: He might not believe you or really anything about me.\nLIAM: You doubt the cube?","response":"DM: There aren't a lot of kings in these lands."}
{"prompt":"SAM: But there's one fewer now.\nTALIESIN: Grog, it doesn't mean what you think it means.\nTRAVIS: Oh.","response":"DM: “We're thinking of shoving off. We recently got a tip, if you're interested. Word came about about a dickhead with too much change in his basement—”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I got it, I got it, I got it!\nLIAM: There's a very short man, right there.\nTALIESIN: He's in a cast. He's been playing with a cast the entire time.","response":"DM: Towards the back of the tavern, there's a small wooden thing. He's lounging, he's a casual guy, the Doctor."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: His name is Jonathon.","response":"DM: No. It is Doctor Dranzel."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Please, Vex, a little respect, he's a physician.","response":"DM: “Anyway.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: A tip about a dickhead.","response":"DM: “Word came about a dickhead who has too much change in his basement. It's weighing down his personality. You wanna help this poor old withered man alleviate this burden?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You mean steal from him?","response":"DM: “No! I mean, help it go to good hard-working folk who deserve it more.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What kind of a dickhead is he?","response":"DM: “I haven't dealt with him personally. People have told me he's a bit of a thorn in the side of, well, any lively folk. Especially those of an artistic persuasion.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: What's his name?","response":"DM: “Don't know the name. But I know where he lives. We've looked at the place, cased it if you will. There could be a few ways in. Unfortunately, we've become a little higher profile during our stay here than we expected and I don't know if we're quite as skilled in the realm of shadow-walking.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Doctor, we're quite skilled but we have a bit of a name for ourselves as well. I'm afraid we may not be able to help you out.","response":"DM: “Right, very well.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're quite the opposite of low profile.","response":"DM: “Well, not to worry. Figured I'd pass it your way.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: If we were to pursue it, what would your take be?","response":"DM: “Well, based on a finder's fee, and based on the relationship we've had all these years, our troupe would be happy to take a 40% cut.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: And this is a vast sum of money we might find?","response":"DM: “From what I've heard, sizeable enough for me to want to include someone the likes of you. You know I don't like to include outsiders so regularly.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, I'm not quite an outsider. Yes, them. Well, we could investigate, if you give us an address or description.\nLIAM: I haven't been paying close attention, but who is this mark?\nLAURA: He didn't say his name.\nLIAM: Don't know his name, he's just a dickhead. That's all you know?\nLAURA: What district does he live in?\nTRAVIS: No, no, no. The old man wants to redistribute his wealth and we would be the vessel by which he would do that.\nTRAVIS: Grog.","response":"DM: “That's a good name. Yeah. Speaks of intelligence.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Insight check?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 29.\nLAURA: Wow, that's a good insight check.\nMARISHA: I rolled a 19.\nLAURA: Secrets, secrets.\nMARISHA: I get secrets!\nSAM: Pike, thank you for being my wingman back there.\nASHLEY: You're welcome, but how come you never told us about Dr. Dranzel? Did you forget about him?\nSAM: I told you–\nASHLEY: Did you forget about Dr. Dranzel?\nTRAVIS: You forgot about Dranzel. Those motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dranzel.\nTALIESIN: This is my favorite thing ever.","response":"DM: “But no worries.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So you're just, out of the good of your heart, wanting to redistribute a little bit of funds to help out a few less fortunate people, that's all you have in this?","response":"DM: “Yeah!”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Really?","response":"DM: “We're all rather less fortunate than this dickhead, and I don't see why a little off his table wouldn't even be noticed, probably.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And where exactly did you find this information? On this dickhead?\nTRAVIS: I think he said he asked him.\nMARISHA: You asked him? What?\nTRAVIS: No, no the old man asked him: oh, I need to redistribute.","response":"DM: I have my reasons, my connections, my friends here, and I've been told that his estate has been abandoned for some time, actually."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Keyleth, this is an old friend of mine, who I trust very much. He saved me when I was troubled and taught me much about the ways of performing and charming. He has my full trust.\nMARISHA: Well, if I know anything about your skills, Scanlan, I think it says a lot about Dr. Dranzel. So–\nSAM: I'll take that as a compliment.\nMARISHA: You're welcome. Forgive me if I'm–\nTALIESIN: I think we obviously– any friend of Scanlan is a friend of ours and I think if Dr. Dranzel here– may I call you Dr. Dranzel?","response":"DM: “You may.”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I call you Dr. Dra?\nTALIESIN: That has a really nice ring to it.","response":"DM: “Sounds to me unfinished and rather sloppy. Just Doctor is fine.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Professor Dranzel.","response":"DM: “Yes? Doctor. Doctor.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Dr. Dranzel, and I want to know if you're really a doctor later, but I think, perhaps, maybe there's a little tidbit of information about this that you're holding back with because– I would understand. We're new. We don't really know each other. We're not really on that friendship level yet, but my point is, we could be friends like that. We could be– I'm trying to see if this works.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You know what I'm doing. I'm attempting Friends.","response":"DM: Oh, interesting."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm attempting.\nTALIESIN: I get advantage on charisma rolls.","response":"DM: Oh, right, right. Okay, okay. Yep, go for it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Am I just rolling charisma?","response":"DM: You're rolling a persuasion with advantage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, persuasion roll with advantage. Oh, that's nice. 23.","response":"DM: Okay. He looks to you and goes, “We don't know who it is. We've been told it's in the Cloudtop District. It's a red brick building. It's been abandoned for over a year and apparently it's been well boarded up. But from what I've been told, quite a lot of wealth is down there. But it's a bit dangerous of an entry. We have no way of getting into the Cloudtop, but these myths keep finding our ears.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: If it's the house that I think it is, it's already been–\nLAURA: Pillaged?\nTALIESIN: Pillaged. Pillaged is a good word. The rumors were not incorrect but–\nSAM: What house is this?\nTALIESIN: Do you remember with the agon-day with our utler-bay?\nSAM: I don't speak Latin.\nLAURA: Pretty sure it's already been cleaned out.","response":"DM: “That's unfortunate.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Unless you're hearing things we don't know about.","response":"DM: “I know that a few individuals have tried to make their way in. Came out with hefty sums of gold but seemed to be a bit spooked.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm gonna pull up a chair and sit down in front of him. Hi, there. My name's Greg. Greg. Yeah, I'm Scanlan's friend, Craig.\nLIAM: Scanlan might be able to help you with this. I'll definitely be able to help you with this, but I'm not going to do anything unless I know something more, so if you want to go into the house, if you want me to break us into the house, which I can certainly do, I really need to know a little bit more. Your chances of getting whatever you're after inside raise if you're honest with me. And I don't feel yet like you're being honest with me, so I want to help you, but I don't think I can and without me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but we're not getting in the house, so is there anything else you wanna tell me about–?","response":"DM: “That's all I know. All I know is they've had a few other of the thieving persuasion have made their way in before and they came out with a decent chunk of change, given that they could only be in there for a short time.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm gonna insight check. That is a 19.","response":"DM: He's hard to read, but the best you can tell is he's been pretty clear with you. And at this point as you're looking at him, his eyes go–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And this is the point where I buy you a beer. And I put the coin down.\nSAM: Well, they can't play as well as you, but they're pretty good.","response":"DM: He takes the coin. Takes the drink. “Well, you know where it is. You know what it looks like. If you're interested in finding your way in and come out with anything, we'll be here about another week.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hmm. Have you noticed– I'm sure you've seen many people come in and out, but an older gentleman dressed much nicer than he should be in an establishment like this?","response":"DM: You describe Riskel to him? Riskel's elven. Thin features, older. Has some battle scars, but long-ish hair kept behind his ears. And as you describe it, he goes, “Yes, yes actually. We had a gentleman like that who came in here a couple of times about a week ago, and last saw a few days ago.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: A few days ago?","response":"DM: “Yeah! He came in and watched one of our performances. Tipped us rather well!” (chuckles)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Did he?","response":"DM: “Seemed a bit hurried.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes. Did you see where he went?","response":"DM: “No, I assumed he was staying here at the tavern.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Really? Are there rooms here?","response":"DM: “Yeah. Just upstairs, they have rooms here.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You should see if there's rooms downstairs.\nLAURA: Yeah. I get up and leave the table and go talk to the barkeep.\nSAM: Do you guys want us to create some sort of distraction while you go search the place?\nLAURA: I'm going to talk to the barkeep and talk about rooms, potentially, first.\nSAM: For us?\nLAURA: Just seeing what they have available, and what's being rented right now.\nSAM: Because we know he's downstairs.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say, he was going to go downstairs. I'll go with Team Downstairs.\nTALIESIN: Team Downstairs it is.\nASHLEY: Team Downstairs.","response":"DM: As you head to the barkeep, you see a dwarven woman wearing a simple blouse, but pulled up past the elbows. She's currently wiping down part of the front– you can see her hair is pulled up to a ponytail that drifts past her shoulders down to the center of her chest. She glances up to you as you approach. “Hi, so what can I get you, dear?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hi. You have rooms, yes?","response":"DM: “We have rooms, aye. We only got one currently not occupied.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do you have an older gentleman? Elven, battle scars– I describe him– staying here right now?","response":"DM: “No? No, I haven't seen someone like that.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Insight-check her?","response":"DM: Make an insight check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's okay. 23?","response":"DM: 23? Her demeanor has changed, and she has gotten guarded. “Nope, haven't seen anyone like that here. Sorry! No. A lot of patrons coming through.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah. So many people come in and out. It would be so easy to lose sight of somebody like that who came in. I put five gold pieces onto the countertop. It sure would be wonderful if you could remember anything about him being here, however.","response":"DM: She takes her cloth that she's wiping the counter with, and wipes over and pushes the gold coins towards you. Pulls back and goes, “Sorry, dear. I can't help you.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I walk up by my sister, and where the woman just wiped that away, I take a piece of chalk out of my pocket and write thieves' cant– not the word “thieves' cant”– I use the thieves' cant on the bar and say, in that language: there is a threat here. I can help you deal with it. And that's it.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Persuasion, you said? 20.","response":"DM: She looks at it. Looks at you. Still holding her cloth, wipes it clean from the bar pretty quickly. (quietly) “You one of them? Kitchen storage room. Under the rice and grain barrels.” (louder) “Sorry! Can't help you. That's unfortunate.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Completely understandable. Thank you for your time!","response":"DM: “Of course, of course.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We need to have a talk.\nTALIESIN: Let's all meet.\nLAURA: Scanlan, could you have your wonderful friends create a distraction?\nSAM: I can help them create one.\nLAURA: Just enough so we can slip unnoticed downstairs.\nTRAVIS: Hold on. He's downstairs. Underground. Do we think maybe he's a–\nTALIESIN: No, because that would be very complicated to deal with while still being part of the political infrastructure of the city here.\nLIAM: We need to talk.","response":"DM: You actually have seen him outside at various events for the council. He was publicly around for– especially during your guys' intro– when you were first given entry to the council. You've seen Riskel around in daylight."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I bet you one gold he's a vampire.\nTALIESIN: Done!\nLIAM: Yes, Grog, it's true. He's a vampire. Could we please meet in a booth in the corner of the pub, please? We need to talk now.\nTALIESIN: Excuse us, lovely fellows, we have prior business. We'll be talking again very soon.","response":"DM: “Certainly hope so.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I can't be 100% sure, but we are sitting atop the thieves' guild. Pike and I have been here before–\nLAURA: We've been here. We've barged in here before.\nLIAM: Not down in the heart of it like we have. Underneath here is a honeycomb of thieves.\nTRAVIS: (gasps excitedly) Honeycomb! Oh, of thieves.\nLIAM: I think our man is downstairs. They've given me the way in. But it's not going to be easy, it's not just an empty basement. We're sitting on top of the thieves' guild. This is the Clasp!\nLAURA: Well, why do we have to– why is it dangerous? Why can't we just go in and ask for him and get him?\nTRAVIS: Aren't you part of them?\nLIAM: I can– Yes. I should take point. I'm just saying we're not going down into an empty grain cellar to kill a bunch of rats.\nMARISHA: So do we think that the Clasp is protecting Riskel? Is that what we're assuming?\nLIAM: It's possible. For money, anything is possible.\nSAM: Well good to know, but we're still going.\nMARISHA: I mean, you were with these people. Once. What–\nLAURA: Aren't you still– I look at your hand– don't you have the mark?\nLIAM: It's complicated. Where did she say to go? It was through the kitchen?","response":"DM: She said through the kitchen storage room, on the left. And the mark is actually at the middle of his–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I mean, that's what I mean. I've seen it.\nLIAM: Your memory is like an iron trap!\nSAM: I think you guys should go. Right away.\nLAURA: You guys? Where are you?\nSAM: I'll follow close behind.\nSAM: I walk over to Kaylie. And I say: my dear Kaylie, I'm sorry if we got off on a weird foot. I have that effect on people sometimes, especially–","response":"DM: “Your feet are weird? That's interesting.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (chuckles) Especially lovely-to-look-at young ladies.","response":"DM: “Smaller than I expected, those feet!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, you know what they say. Wait, no. Don't.","response":"DM: “I know what they say.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: If you win, I'll give you whatever's in my purse. And if I win, I get a kiss.","response":"DM: “Somehow I think I'm still getting the shit end of the deal.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, don't worry.","response":"DM: You guys shake on it. Are you waiting until sundown, or are you doing it now–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: No, we're going– Oh, are we waiting until sundown? Is that what's happening?\nLIAM: I'm in the kitchen.\nSAM: Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! The first ever flaute-off? Flutist-off? Flute duel! Featuring me! Scanlan Shorthalt! And you, Kaylie…?","response":"DM: “Kaylie's fine.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Kaylie's Fine, everyone!","response":"DM: Some of the folks around are like– some seem disinterested by it, and some clap."}
{"prompt":"SAM: All eyes up here! It'll be a great show!","response":"DM: At this point, Dr. Dranzel is like: “Hah! Well, this will be interesting!” And he's still sitting back, watching. You guys are going in first, you said?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, I already went in.","response":"DM: Stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: (quietly) She told me to go in! So that's a 23.","response":"DM: Okay. You seem to slip in. And there are two individuals currently running the kitchen. There's the smell of food, but there are no meals currently being cooked. They're just talking to each other. They don't even notice you slip by."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I put my hood up before I head back that way.","response":"DM: Go for it. Make a stealth check?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (quietly) Oh no.\nASHLEY: I follow them! No, just kidding.\nLAURA: Oh, I get advantage. Yeah! 25.","response":"DM: 25? Same thing. You guys turn around to the left of the kitchen. There is a small stairway that goes down about five feet into the storage room, where you find your brother. And this is all very familiar to you. You've been here once before. This is where you guys exited the guild on the way out, a long time ago. And there are a series of crates and stuff. But in the far back corner, there are two sacks that are labeled “rice” and “grain”, that are leaned up against each other. So we'll get to you guys in just a moment. Who is next up after you guys?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: After they go, I call back to the kitchen and I say: to choose the first song will be the lovely gentlemen who have prepared our food for the evening! Please come out here and choose a song for us!","response":"DM: Everyone looks over and one gentleman stands up and–yells out into the kitchen–is like: “Hey! You're picking the song, mates!” Then you see two folks come out. One's an older woman, wrinkled face, hair's a bit tattered, but she seems happy and smiling amongst her– happy lines are all throughout her face. The other one's a younger guy. Probably, looking at the features, related to her, who's helping her out in the kitchen. And they both step out, confounded. “What's going on?” “Well yes, what's going on?”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I grab Keyleth and we slip behind them and into the kitchen.\nMARISHA: 15.\nTALIESIN: 14.","response":"DM: Okay! The distraction was helpful! So you guys slip past, seemingly unnoticed. Everyone's attention is on them, currently. And they both look at each other, and she goes, “I, um. Could you– Flute, you say?” Takes some popcorn from her pouch."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Sure. Oh, yeah, she's– Weird place to put popcorn.","response":"DM: “It's a busy kitchen! Could you sing Clouds Upon the Horizon? That was my favorite as a girl!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ah! It's a ballad, but okay. Sure.\nLIAM: Do you have an earring on? Scanlan, I need you to make an ode to the kitchen staff. Could you call the kitchen staff out and–\nSAM: I did already! I did already!\nLAURA: You called the kitchen staff out?\nSAM: Yes! They're the ones who are suggesting the song!\nLIAM: Oh, really? We've just been in– in the back– in that downstairs room where we didn't know!? Well, we're in a separate room!","response":"DM: Yep! There you go! (chuckles)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Good thought! I had the same one!\nLIAM: Everybody else: come now, come now, come now.\nLAURA: Oh, and… Trinket.","response":"DM: Coming down with you?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: A bear!?\nLIAM: Really? Every tool has its place.\nASHLEY: Nine.\nSAM: Nine?!\nASHLEY: Come on! What else is it gonna be with a disadvantage?\nTRAVIS: 13?\nLAURA: 16.","response":"DM: After the– You're really bringing Trinket down there with you?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is that bad? What else–\nSAM: (yelling) Yes, it's bad!","response":"DM: As you all are waiting, you guys start heading around. And as you're scooting around the kitchen staff, Trinket, who is currently out front, sees everyone scooting around and disappearing into the back. Leaning his head into the tavern, goes, (bear grunt) and begins walking into the tavern. Other patrons start like (startled exclamations), then like, “Bear! Bear, bear!” And other individuals start standing up and seeing this bear come lumbering through the \ntavern, towards the kitchen."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, shit. I hear it. I come out of the kitchen very sneakily. Oh! Oh, my bear! I've been looking everywhere for you. Trinket!\nLIAM: Story of my life.\nLAURA: What are you doing in this tavern! Oh, dear! We should probably head outside! You and me, Trinket!\nLIAM: You've got two minutes.\nLAURA: Fuck. I tell him– Oh! Oh no, that's so sad! But I tell him to head back to the keep, I guess.\nTRAVIS: To the keep, or just outside?\nLAURA: To the keep! 'Cause what else? He can't just hang out without us there!\nASHLEY: Maybe he could stay out there.\nLAURA: Really?\nLIAM: While she's doing this bullshit, I'm going to make sure that the rice bags and everything are not trapped. Is there a clear stairways down, or?","response":"DM: The bags. You go to lift them, expecting them to be very heavy. They're actually filled with something much lighter. They're false-filled, and they actually move out of the way very quickly. And there is this similar hatch that you guys have come through before. It's about five by five foot wide."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I check for traps. Check for traps.","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So mayhaps with the bear entering, there is enough of a distraction for one suit of armor to clankily make its way down?\nSAM: You would think.","response":"DM: You guys were caught in the attention with Trinket, at the same time. So you guys were in the middle of the fray, as you were walking past. As you're bringing Trinket out, the attention is pulled away. I want you guys to make another stealth check."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Come on.","response":"DM: Grog? You have disadvantage on this one now."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Fuck. Ugh. Same rolls. Exact same rolls.\nTRAVIS: 12.\nASHLEY: Nine.","response":"DM: You guys walk past. As you're stepping into the kitchen, you hear the voice of one of the staff, “Excuse me! Excuse me! You can't be back here! This is our kitchen, we're trying–”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up!\nTRAVIS: Yeah, she had a lot to drink!\nASHLEY: I've had so much to drink!\nTRAVIS: You had a lot to drink, be careful. Yeah, she's going to spew!","response":"DM: “Take it outside! Don't do it in our kitchen!”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I need a pan, or something!\nTRAVIS: She's got infectious diseases too! When she spews, everybody catches it!\nASHLEY: I have the consumption.","response":"DM: Pike, make a deception check. (chuckles) I'll say with advantage, since Grog is aiding you in this."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Perception or persuasion?","response":"DM: No, deception."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, deception, deception.\nASHLEY: Deception? Fuck, come on. 12.","response":"DM: With advantage, because Grog's helping you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Come on, gnome!\nASHLEY: 14.","response":"DM: That's better."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, hork like you mean it!","response":"DM: The guy is like, “Oh, no. No! Not in here! Um! Right there!” and he points to a doorway on the other side of the kitchen that leads to the alleyway. And he's like, “Out there! No, go. Go!”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I just start running. I just start running.","response":"DM: Okay. You run and you open the door out into the alleyway. Grog follows you out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I lead Trinket outside and I see them come out the alleyway!","response":"DM: You do, if you go around the side, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, yeah. So I have Trinket hang out in the alley and stay there and wait for us. Be safe, Trinket! If any danger comes your way, intimidate them and run the other direction. Go home. I love you.","response":"DM: Trinket just lies there with his head on his paws."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You guys are evil for making me leave him.\nMARISHA: So there are still two cooks in the kitchen?","response":"DM: No, one cook has come back in and is currently watching her pretend to vomit in the alleyway."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I got a 25 when I checked for traps a few minutes ago?","response":"DM: Okay, thank you. There are no traps on this door, but it is locked."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Am I rolling for performance? 28.","response":"DM: 28!"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: (moans) Oh, don't get it in my head!","response":"DM: Hold on, sorry. This is important, guys. Once I can get the ad off here. So, as you pull out your flute and you prepare for this wondrous–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You've got this on your machine?\n(banjo playing)\nSAM: Is this Jethro Tull?","response":"DM: Yes it is."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yes! Yes!","response":"DM: Let's get to the good part here."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is there a good part?","response":"DM: This is the whole album."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It was just one big, full album. The song was a whole album.","response":"DM: Sure, and as the band picks up behind you–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Come on, Dr. Dra!\nSAM: Everybody give it up for Zed on drums! 24!\nSAM: I can't be one-upped. I use Minor Illusion to create sort of a mirror image of myself, over myself, also playing the flute.","response":"DM: Make another performance check, with advantage."}
{"prompt":"SAM: With advantage? Not as good, 22.\nMARISHA: I can't believe the Jethro Tull song with no flutes was the one you happened to find!\nSAM: It was a ballad! She chose a ballad!\nLIAM: You have the best of Jethro Tull over there, or what?","response":"DM: Apparently all Jethro Tull songs don't have any flute in them! Failure. Big failure on that part."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Just play the scene from Anchorman.","response":"DM: We're going to go back to the–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Jethro Tull would be a great name for a Sith.\nLAURA and ASHLEY: It would!\nLIAM: Careful, careful, I'm still raw.","response":"DM: Aw. Anyway, as it crescendos and crescendos– What did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 22.","response":"DM: 22! You can see, now, the volume of her flute playing begins to pull back, as you begin to step up onto the same table next to her. Twice as high now, with the illusionary Scanlan above you, almost like those awkward middle school superimposed photos of yourself in the upper corner."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And lasers in the background?\nASHLEY: Come on.\nTRAVIS: With advantage?","response":"DM: No."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We're all doing stealth checks?\nLAURA: No, just me.\nTRAVIS: What is fucking going on?\nLAURA: I got 18.\nTRAVIS: 20.\nASHLEY: We don't have an extra roll? It is what it is. I have a six.","response":"DM: Okay. What did you get?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 18.\nASHLEY: Maybe he'll think it's cymbals or something.","response":"DM: Best two out of three, you make your way in."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: How about I pick up Pike with my 20, and I carry her in.","response":"DM: Sure! Still works out."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Minimal clank.\nMARISHA: Plank. Hold your abs.\nSAM: 27.","response":"DM: 27. With this note, you bring once again, this same duel you guys had when you first entered the tavern, and you and Kaylie are facing off, looking directly at each other, furiously going on your flutes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Blowing at each other.\nLAURA: Come on, Scanlan!\nSAM: It's a 22, but I'm going to let her win.","response":"DM: As you begin to trail off the sound of the note, you can see she's starting to already go a little blue in the face, determined to win this. And she's about to falter. You could win this, if you want to, but are you going to let her?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: With a wink, I end my note.","response":"DM: As the flute leaves your lips and you go into a fake gasp of air, she finishes on a high, piercing tune, a trill, and then finishes off, carrying the flute away with a smile as your illusion fades."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ladies and gentlemen, Kaylie's Fine! Ladies and gentlemen.","response":"DM: “You're good, but I'm better.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What?","response":"DM: “You said your purse.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is she going to inspect it?","response":"DM: You reach over. Are you going to start thumbing through your purse and pulling out gold? She goes, “No, your purse. You bet your purse.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I mean, that was a figure of speech, right?\nLAURA: You totally let her win and you're going to give her all your money?\nTRAVIS: He forgot about that part.","response":"DM: “I spit on it.” She looks over to Dranzel. Dranzel goes, “I did hear you say a full purse.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, I hope there's so much money in that bag.\nSAM: A deal is a deal.\nTRAVIS: The things you do for women.\nLAURA: Do not give her your money!","response":"DM: What are you doing, Scanlan?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: If there was a piece of advice that ever lived.\nSAM: I untie the purse and I hand it over.\nLAURA: Do you take any of the gold out secretly before you hand it over to her?","response":"DM: You're not there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Such a life lesson.","response":"DM: She takes it. How much was in there?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: 2,600.","response":"DM: She takes the chain purse and weighs it. “Let it be known throughout this tavern that Scanlan Shorthalt is a man of his word.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thank you, my dear.","response":"DM: She takes the chain purse and flicks it away. It vanishes in a puff of smoke. She goes, “That's a lot of coin.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I get around a lot.","response":"DM: “Perhaps we'll have a drink later.” And she steps off the table. Now the rest of you have all made your way down into the storage chamber."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh god.\nLIAM: Anything we encounter is far easier than what just happened.\nLAURA: Do you want to cry? Because I would want to cry.\nSAM: Money means nothing to me.\nASHLEY: Should somebody pickpocket her?\nLAURA: Fuck yeah, man.","response":"DM: Are you going to join them?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes, of course!","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a stealth check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, wait. Oh yes, I still have to sneak back there, don't I? I just go invisible.\nLIAM: I'm sorry, I was just thinking of Wendydoodle's art from the comic. Yeah, yeah, I'm going to check that door for traps, is what I'm going to do.\nLIAM: Earlier, yeah, I did get a 25 up top, yeah. I thought you were giving me another door. Yeah, 25 up top where the fake bags of rice were.","response":"DM: Right, but it was still locked, you didn't roll to–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: To pick it, sure, that's no problem. It is a 23.","response":"DM: 23, it's a little tough, you just manage to get it up and it comes off and the latch– pretty solid still."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Amateurs.","response":"DM: Okay, you open the (creaks) leads down below and you find yourself looking down into a familiar stairway that leads into darkness."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Me.\nTALIESIN: I am.\nMARISHA: I'm up next.\nASHLEY: Oh, do we roll?","response":"DM: No, just let me– Who wants to go after Keyleth?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm probably in the back since I was the last to move.","response":"DM: Okay, so Scanlan will be in the back and then probably Grog next to him and Pike right there."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: He made a little rainbow.\nMARISHA: Oh, it is a rainbow.\nLAURA: It's so pretty.\nTALIESIN: They can't see it because it's off; they won't be able to see it.\nLIAM: Everybody hold up for a second, could we crowd-surf the bard up to us at the front please?\nSAM: Oh, is that me?\nLIAM: The bard, yes.\nSAM: Grog, toss me forward.\nTRAVIS: Not really getting his meaning, I grab him by the back of the shirt and I just chuck him.","response":"DM: Being at the bottom of a stairway, I want you to make an acrobatics check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thanks Grog, thanks.\nLIAM: I'm gonna scoop a hand under his head and give him a slap on both sides.\nSAM: (huffs) What are we looking at?\nSAM: You– me? Yes, just do my thing?\nSAM: Okay. Yes, yes, sir.\nLIAM: Five locks?","response":"DM: Five locks, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I want to perception check for traps and for Thieves' Cant and anything else.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I speak Elvish, Common, Abyssal.\nLAURA: You speak the same languages as me.","response":"DM: It's like you grew up together."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I also speak Undercommon.","response":"DM: Okay. Looking at it, Abyssal– you do recognize two of them, and it's the top one and the bottom one. And both of them, the equivalent in Common would be a phrase like: enter, or pass."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Is one of them in Underdark?","response":"DM: No Undercommon, no."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What about Draconic?","response":"DM: Underdark would be Undercommon."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Celestial? Elven?","response":"DM: Nothing in Elven."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Dwarvish?","response":"DM: There is a Dwarvish one."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, oh! I have a Belt of Dwarvenkind that lets me read Dwarvish.","response":"DM: If you could read."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But that's okay, Pike can read Dwarvish.\nSAM: It sounds like the Abyssal ones are the ones that you have to do.\nLIAM: There's five of them.\nSAM: Yeah, but those say 'enter'.\nTALIESIN: We don't know what the other ones say, though.\nTRAVIS: For intelligence?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I do.","response":"DM: Okay. Coming up behind Grog and you whisper to him and let him have the moment. You recognize the rune and it's the Common equivalent of entry, enter."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: None of them are in Elvish?","response":"DM: No, none of them are in Elvish."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Sylvan?","response":"DM: There's no Elvish whatsoever."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: This word in Dwarvish means “gentry”.","response":"DM: Does anyone know Goblin?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't you know Goblin, Scanlan?\nSAM: I fucking hate goblins, that doesn't mean I know their language.","response":"DM: And does anyone know Primordial?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I do.\nTALIESIN: You know Primordial?","response":"DM: The fourth one on the bottom. You have the top one and the bottom one, which you read. The middle one in Dwarvish, which you guys read. The fourth one is a Primordial phrase that says the equivalent, and it is a language of guttural, elemental sounds. It is a no, a stop, a general halt type."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Shit. Don't do that lock.\nLIAM: So we that leaves one left and we don't know what says. There's no Thieves' Cant on this door?\nLAURA: So wait, the top one is a yes. The middle one is a yes. The bottom one is a yes.","response":"DM: The second one down."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We don't know.","response":"DM: The second one down you do know, that's the one that says no."}
{"prompt":"SAM: The B-slot we don't know.\nLIAM: So all together there's five locks and we know four of them?","response":"DM: You know four of them, yes."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Is there any way to try to figure out what it says?","response":"DM: Outside of not knowing the language or any magical means that would allow you to."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I look at the two in Abyssal. They say 'entry', is that right?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And I already checked for traps and there were no traps, just locks","response":"DM: No, you have not checked for traps on this one."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do I need to check each lock?","response":"DM: You would."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Fuck.\nSAM: Why don't you just check the two that are unknown to us, that are negative?\nMARISHA: Do you want an enhancement of your abilities?\nLIAM: Yeah.\nMARISHA: Okay. You use dexterity, right? I give him Cat's Grace? I cast Enhance Ability on him.\nSAM: You're making this shit up.\nMARISHA: Kind of, yeah.\nLIAM: So we got Abyssal, Abyssal, Dwarven in the middle and–","response":"DM: Primordial on the second to last."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And the Primordial says no, yeah?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The Abyssals say yes and the Dwarven said what?\nLAURA: Yes. They all say enter, entry.\nLIAM: So I want to try to pick the three that I know. Two Abyssals and the Dwarven say entry. And I have advantage on.\nLAURA: Did you check for traps?\nLIAM: I did. I checked for traps, right?","response":"DM: You're rolling right now to check for traps."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm rolling right now to check for traps.\nLIAM: So the top is Abyssal. Here I go.\nLAURA: Natural 20!","response":"DM: The top one is locked, but it is not trapped."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Go for the middle.\nLIAM: No, I'm gonna unlock that.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it. With advantage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: With advantage.\nLAURA: Balls!\nLIAM: Four, so that's okay. This is lock-pick, right? 23.","response":"DM: 23. Not a very complicated lock, the top one (click). Comes off without a problem. Perfectly silently, you just pull the latch back. (creaks)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Natural 20!","response":"DM: You don't have advantage on checking for traps."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, I thought you said I did.","response":"DM: No, for making the checks you do. This is for dexterity, checking for traps is a perception roll."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Perception's 20.","response":"DM: Okay. Bottom one, not trapped."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 20.","response":"DM: That one is also not trapped."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, and don't–\nLIAM: 20.","response":"DM: That one is trapped."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And the Primordial said no.\nMARISHA: Yeah. In their language it's pronounced huh-gluf.\nLIAM: But what does it mean? We've got three traps.\nSAM: What the fuck is wrong with you? The ones that say no are trapped! How is this hard to understand?!\nLIAM: That is 26, the last one.","response":"DM: The second one? The one that–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That we don't know what it is.","response":"DM: You've seen scribbles like this before. It appears to be some sort of goblinoid language but none of you actually understand what it says. Does appear to be trapped."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Does appear to be trapped.\nLAURA: How about you don't unlock those ones.\nTRAVIS: No, no, don't tell him.\nLIAM: I'm not alone, and this affects you, asshole.\nASHLEY: Unlock the ones that are not trapped.\nMARISHA: You already popped the top lock and nothing happened, right?\nLIAM: So there's two that are trapped. I'm going to attempt to disarm the two that are trapped.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, do that.\nSAM: What are you doing?\nLIAM: This affects you, you dark sword-wielding dick!\nTRAVIS: No, I'm serious, you had a good thought!\nSAM: Why would you do that? Do the ones that aren't trapped first.\nLIAM: Everybody wait, wait, wait, wait. Everybody please walk up the stairs ten feet, please.\nASHLEY: No!\nLIAM: Yeah, walk up the stairs. Ten feet.\nLAURA: I'm walking away.\nLIAM: You're all gonna see it.\nSAM: What are you doing?\nLIAM: I'm gonna try to open the door, you little asshole. But I don't want you to get burned while I get burned.\nSAM: I won't be burned because you're not gonna mess with the traps! Just do the ones that aren't trapped!\nTRAVIS: I walk forward and I grab Scanlan and everybody and I back everybody up ten feet.\nLAURA: Try the ones that aren't trapped first, please?","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I knew a goliath in Whitestone Who lived in a very, very fine home 'Til one day a wizard, or maybe a large lizard Burned it and left him alone.\nSAM: You did the top already.\nLIAM: Check for traps or?\nALL: You unlocked it.","response":"DM: You unlocked the top one. And the latch came open without a problem."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do the middle one.\nLIAM: Can I use what I just rolled for the middle one?\nTRAVIS: Make sure you disarm the other two.\nLIAM: There's too many people talking, I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's going on. Yeah, I just rolled a ten twice, and that's a 23.","response":"DM: 23? (clicking) The middle one opens. (creaking)"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Now the bottom one– shush!","response":"DM: Go for it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Try pushing the door.\nTRAVIS: No, no, think of your team, make sure they're all disarmed.\nLIAM: So here's where we don't know what's going on. We got number one, number three, and number five are untrapped, unlocked. Number two and number four are trapped, but I'm just pushing the door open?\nLAURA: Do whatever you want to do.\nLIAM: But I don't have to make the decision on my own, because you're all ten feet away from me.\nLAURA: Try disarming them, sure, why not? Do your thing\nMARISHA: You've got advantage, so why not, fuck it.","response":"DM: Vax. What is your choice? What do you wish to do in this moment? You have three untrapped locks open, two locks that seem to be trapped. One of which said no."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, I'm gonna open it.","response":"DM: You push the door open. As you push on the door, the two locks on there give no resistance. Seems they were both false locks and as the door opens you get the feeling that perhaps the traps were based on the attempt to pick them, or disarm."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Good job, good job, brother.\nASHLEY: High five.\nLIAM: No high fives.\nASHLEY: Just maybe– just like a touch then.\nLIAM: Here.\nASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: You're now looking into a familiar very dark hallway with very low light by a few torch sconces that just flicker. The material used to keep them burning, pretty low and the embers are starting to drift into a small pile of soot on the stone floor beneath them. You can smell the remaining smoke and scent of burning wood. To the right of you is a hallway that continues down to where Spireling Modeth once lived before you cut his head off. The doors are closed to that room and it curves off to the left down a long hallway. To the left of where you currently are, the hallway continues into darkness and turns around the corner into shadow."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so there was a cell that we were in, and there was a larger room where we were surrounded by Modeth and a lot of people.\nASHLEY: But there were a lot of hallways\nTALIESIN: Do we smell anything?","response":"DM: You smell the residue of burnt wood and tinder. Nothing beyond that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do I see any tracks that look like they could have been from an elf, an old guy with some battle scars.","response":"DM: Make a survival check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, I could do those too. Can I help her with that?","response":"DM: No. Sorry, her ranger tracking training is far beyond anything you as a barbarian have attempted. Though you are good at tracking naturally as a barbarian, you could attempt to make a roll on your own. But it wouldn't be helping her with it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: 21.\nLAURA: I would have had to roll a 20, I bet.\nLIAM: While we're waiting, I'm gonna throw my hood over one shoulder and I'm gonna undo my sleeves so that– Oh, the Clasp is back here, isn't it?\nLAURA: Just take your shirt off. Show it to the world. I'm gonna cast Pass without a Trace on all of us.\nMARISHA: So wait, are there two different directions?","response":"DM: Yeah, so the right or the left."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I ascertain if there's any type of draft or any–?","response":"DM: Percival already tried that."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, you already tried?\nLIAM: So, here's what I'm thinking. I mean, we could sneak through here and this one's going to sound like a herd of–\nLAURA: Not necessarily. I just cast Pass Without a Trace.\nSAM: Don't disparage her, she's wonderful and beautiful.\nLIAM: Our chances of sneaking through here are low. I could try to talk us through. This guy's a threat to them because the kingdom wants him and they're housing him. And that is not really financially viable. So I feel like perhaps we talk our way out of this. We don't have to go in banging an evil sword, not that we have one.\nLAURA: Yeah, we're down here, obviously we belong.\nLIAM: I belong. And I will vouch for you.\nLAURA: Beautiful. Let's do it.\nMARISHA: I definitely would rather not fight the entire thieves' guild.\nSAM: We're not sneaking, then? 'Cause if we did sneak, we could– Don't you have Fly or something?\nLIAM: We're in a very thin hallway right now.\nSAM: All she'd have to do is fly just off the-\nLAURA: I've got no flying. I used my only flying potion.\nLIAM: I'm gonna call out. I'm calling out, “Member of the Clasp entering. I need to parlay.”","response":"DM: A moment passes and you see stepping out of both sides of the hallway a number of hooded figures. Five. Ten. 15 individuals then begin to close in, all hoods up, cloaks around them, you can see through the dim light the crest of chins. Those of you that have darkvision, you can see some features, they all are humanoid, around human height, a few that are smaller, whether they be younger or halfling or gnomish in origin, you can't really make out their details in this\ncircumstance, but they all close in as you guys all stand there in the center of the hallway."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I do start unlacing, and I say, I'm one of you. And I show the tattoo on my back.","response":"DM: As this happens, you can see there's a part in the crowd, and one much larger than the rest of the members of the Clasp steps forward, pushing others out of the way. You see a very thick square jaw piercing out from underneath the shadowed hood, and the hand pulls it back and as you can now see the crooked pointed ears, snarling nose and underbite of a mostly orcish half-orc, one you've encountered once before–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: It's Modeth?","response":"DM: No, no. Modeth was human, you killed Modeth. The orc steps forward and looks about the group and goes, (grunts) “Seems like you stumbled into an early grave.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I didn't stumble, I've been here before. I've a fucked up past with this organisation but I've come to tell you– And I'm pointing at the tattoo.","response":"DM: He reaches out and grabs your arm and spins you around to look at the tattoo on your back violently. Like a ragdoll. You're being treated like a child. (grunts) Releases you for a second, as you fall off-balance for a second but catch yourself. He has his other hand at his belt side, and you can see what looks to be the pommel of the dagger at the ready and he goes–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Sovereign Uriel knows you have Daxio here. Uriel wants him. You are in danger. This whole organization is in danger with him here.","response":"DM: “Silence! Who else knows you're here?”"}

{"prompt":"LAURA: We didn't exactly break in, we just kind of– I'm just shutting up.\nSAM: He's a member of the Clasp. He gained entry the way that you do.","response":"DM: “He brings in outsiders after being warned not to return with them. Yet you say you are here for a– who was it?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do you care that the Emperor knows you're holding a person he wants?","response":"DM: “He won't be held for long. You can tell the Emperor he's not a worry of ours soon.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where's he going?\nLIAM: He's a traitor to the kingdom. Uriel wants him, you are bringing danger upon this house.","response":"DM: “Uriel's useless.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Uriel has a lot of gold and will probably give a reward.\nSAM: Not the kind of reward he's already offering you. We come bearing an offering from Sovereign Uriel himself in exchange for this man. I reach into my bag and I produce–\nASHLEY: No gold. No money.\nSAM: The very elegantly carved box I had made that contains the magical blue shard that we discovered many, many years ago, and I open it just for a moment and close it and say, this is the Shard of Kara. It is a magical item that can grant the user one wish, any wish.\nLAURA: But Scanlan, you said we were going to keep that for ourselves.\nSAM: I did. But it's clear that this man knows who we are and why we've come.\nLAURA: No.\nSAM: As a last resort we are cleared to offer this to you in exchange for your prisoner, or is he– are you holding him as a prisoner or–?","response":"DM: He shushes you.

{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, well.","response":"DM: “Hush!”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It is activated by a secret chant that we will only tell you once we are safe and the prisoner– or keep– I don't know. Are you keeping him as a prisoner or–","response":"DM: He waves his hand and shushes you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And avoid the hammer of the Empire.\nTRAVIS: And keep the money at the same time.\nMARISHA: Sounds to me like you just won twice.","response":"DM: He reaches his hand out for the box."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I Druidcraft a little bit and Druidcraft a little bit of breeze seeping from the box?\nTALIESIN: I pull out a small note that I hold in my right hand.","response":"DM: Make a sleight-of-hand check."}

You mutter beneath your breath and swivel your hand for a second as he hands– the other individual inspecting it with the glass monocle looking piece.

{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I hold up a beautiful elegant note that I show in my hand and put it in my breast pocket.","response":"DM: “Very well. We have him in holding, awaiting his documents. I'll show you. I'll leave the door open, we'll clear the halls. Do what you must. We will not be involved. You have an hour.”"}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I Druidcraft a gust coming out of it?","response":"DM: I would not recommend it."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Okay!","response":"DM: He looks over at the gentleman who inspected it earlier and nods his head. “Accepted.” And they continue walking forward."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Lucky fucking druid.","response":"DM: It is the piece you put in the actual–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's a blue shard that we found in– long, long ago– it's real crystal and it's real magic.","response":"DM: Yes. I know what that is."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Because I don't.","response":"DM: Well, it was sufficient upon inspection for this."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.\nLAURA: Whoa, I think it opens a portal to another plane.\nSAM: I don't know what it is, but it's magic.\nMARISHA: Is it the one we got at last Winter's Crest? That one? The one that we were using shards of it to carve through dimensions? Cool.","response":"DM: It had a few uses. So as you guys move into the hallway, a bunch of the Clasp members leave, you're led down a couple of doors on the left and right. You guys recognize these, these are the holding cells that you guys were held shortly after your battle."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yep, we were held in these cells.","response":"DM: So the cell on the left is closed, the cell on the right is closed. He walks up to that cell, and without even a bit of noise pulls out a keyring, unlocks it and puts the keys away. (grunts) Turns around and the rest of the Clasp scatter out of the hallway. He puts the box away in his cloak and he says, “One hour. Do as you must.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I take the keys. We've got two to choose from?","response":"DM: He's at the door. He unlocked one for you guys."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No, no. But there's two cells? Or has he opened the cell that he's in?","response":"DM: There are three cells in this hallway. The middle cell is the one that he led you to and unlocked for you."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, thanks.","response":"DM: And he steps away, looks at the rest of you guys–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: There are five blocks on each side.","response":"DM: – and then vanishes down the hallway. So it's now just you guys in this hallway."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Did you give him the password?\nTALIESIN: I have not given him the password yet.","response":"DM: No, because he already opened the box."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Daxio, we've got your papers, c'mon.","response":"DM: I just, because I foresee something possibly happening here."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I think we were saying the password made it work.\nTRAVIS: I think he knows we're full of shit.\nLAURA: I think he knows it's super powerful magic anyway and he doesn't give a shit and he's taking it anyway.\nTALIESIN: That's good, because man, this was some bullshit.\nTALIESIN: Where did he leave from?","response":"DM: You guys entered this direction and they scattered this way."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm going to lock eyes with Grog and motion him towards one side of the door, and I'm gonna take the other.\nLAURA: Can you Wall of Stone the other side of the hallway? Just to block them from coming down that hallway again.

{"prompt":"LAURA: I thought the one he left through.","response":"DM: Okay, they left this way. Okay, so you wall this off?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah. Why not?","response":"DM: There is now a wall of stone in the middle of that hallway."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Hope we don't have to leave that way, but she can just dispel it.\nMARISHA: I mean, we can get it out.\nTRAVIS: Vax and I are on either side of the door.\nMARISHA: So is this leading into something crazy?\nLAURA: Into his cell.\nMARISHA: Into a labyrinth? Or just his cell?","response":"DM: As far so you know, a cell."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: As far as we know, just a cell.\nLAURA: He just completely took an expensive thing and left us to rot, pretty much, I think.","response":"DM: Anyone else want to change this arrangement?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We are in a giant death cluster. How about we spread out a touch? Like two people to a door in that hallway.\nTALIESIN: I'll take the other door.\nLAURA: I'll go down with Scanlan on the other one so I can ranged attack–\nTRAVIS: I'm just saying, if he took out a magical spectacle and knows we're full of shit, we're all gonna die.\nLAURA: I'm gonna stand with my back against the wall that she's built up. Like that, yeah.\nMARISHA: Did half-orc dude say he was just in this cell? That's all he said?\nLAURA: Yeah.","response":"DM: They essentially unlocked the cell, they're walking away, they're turning their heads and letting you do what you want."}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Is there any other entrances or anything else around?","response":"DM: There's just this door and this door and they're both currently–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fine, go for it.\nLIAM: And I called out already.\nTRAVIS: I would like to rage.","response":"DM: Okay. Let us go ahead for the sake of this, roll initiative depending on what happens going forward just so we have that."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Just in case, eh?\nTRAVIS: Just because I have a fear of construction paper. Advantage.\nTALIESIN: What did construction paper do to you?\nTRAVIS: What did it not do?\nLIAM: 25.\nTALIESIN: 25.\nLAURA: 26.","response":"DM: 20 to 15?"}

{"prompt":"MARISHA: Vax is our point man.\nLIAM: We're both at the door and I called out, so I guess we'll wait a moment to see if he'll–","response":"DM: A moment passes."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You want to check? I can open the door.\nLIAM: Well, I already went stealth earlier too, I got a 25 on the stealth check. I can go again if you want.","response":"DM: Do you want to try and stealth in the room?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: If we wait like 30 seconds and nothing happens.","response":"DM: Nothing happens, yeah. Okay, make another stealth check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: No. 21. I'm doing nothing, I'm just standing in place.\nTRAVIS: He thinks you're going in.","response":"DM: So, as you push in the doorway, quietly, you see, for a moment inside, you can see there's a little bit of light from overheard in the room that lights it up. You see in the distance what looks to be a latrine in the far corner, and as soon as you peek in the doorway, you glance out the side of your eyeline, and you immediately see a figure, and a flash of metal."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, I'll use Uncanny Dodge, then.\nLIAM: Unless it's an area effect. If it's an area effect I'll use Evasion.","response":"DM: No, it is a direct attack, as a giant metallic glaive comes down to you. That is going to be a 19 to hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That hits.\nLIAM: Nine points with the Uncanny Dodge.","response":"DM: Okay. At this point now you reveal the interior, and right here at the door, you see there, standing, Daxio right before you. Armored up, sweat on the brow, holding what looks to be a large glaive, a halberd-type weapon with a giant bladed tip, which (whack) strikes you and gets back in defensive position. “You! I knew it.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Isn't he old?","response":"DM: Daxio's a mature elf."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Can I move and then hold my turn? Can I move at all? Hold the actions?","response":"DM: You've moved in, you could ready your action if you'd like."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, could I just use my movement and then wait?","response":"DM: You could if you'd like."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Yeah. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to circle around and I'm never going to leave him. I'm going to go all the way around, circle him, and then wait. And then my trigger is when Grog steps up to him.","response":"DM: You can't move through other creatures. In this place and area–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, I can't go around him?","response":"DM: No, he has you blocked off at the doorway, and has like squared off with you right now, with the glaive."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is Grog considered five feet away from him?","response":"DM: Grog is considered five feet away from you, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh. Then I'm going to sneak attack him.","response":"DM: Not five feet away from him."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: From me?","response":"DM: In order to sneak attack a creature, you have to have an ally adjacent to the enemy, not to you. The idea is, they're being harried by two different points and can't form a good defense."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is a 24.","response":"DM: 24 does hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I was only going to do that if you told me that I could move around him, now that I know that I can't–\nLAURA: I call out: Daxio, don't be a moron. Step outside and lower your weapon, you're surrounded.","response":"DM: Make an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: You were using your deep voice, so you could–\nLAURA: My deep voice!\nSAM: You could get advantage.\nLAURA: To intimidate him more. 13.","response":"DM: 13. Okay. You shout it out, and it echoes through the hallway. Who knows if it's landed or had an effect, you can't see him from your current perspective."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Should I walk forward or should I keep–\nTRAVIS: He's in there by himself, and no other are enemies.\nLAURA: I mean, as far as we know.\nSAM: Why don't you check the other door?\nLIAM: Whoever's in there is locked in there.\nLAURA: Yeah. I'm just going to– I'm going to stay where I am, I guess.\nLIAM: I'm going to disengage and back up against the back wall–","response":"DM: You've already disengaged."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: But if I were to go left or right, would I be out of range of hitting him because of the doorway?","response":"DM: You would be over here, probably, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So if I move sideways either way I can't hit him?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I'm not going to do that. I'm going to just step back against the back wall and hold.","response":"DM: Are you using your disengage action or not?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Was I within five feet of him?\nYes, I'm going to use disengage.","response":"DM: Okay. So you use your bonus action to disengage. Because you're not used to fighting these long polearm weapons, as you begin to take another step back, you realize he can actually hit you from further away than you expect."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Can I have used my bonus action to hide?\nLAURA: Natural 20.","response":"DM: Okay. You vanish. Hold until what? What do you want to be the trigger?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Until Grog steps in.\nTALIESIN: Is there a grille on that door? Any kind of–","response":"DM: No, it is a solid door."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: It is a solid door.","response":"DM: It is currently open, but–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, no, I mean on the door that I'm next to.","response":"DM: Oh, no, that is closed. That is a solid door."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm going to hold– I'm going to stay where I am and hold my action until I see somebody I want to shoot in the hallway.\nTRAVIS: I bellow out: you're in for the fight of your life if you don't drop your polearm. The next thing that hits the ground if you don't will be your skull.","response":"DM: Are you using your action to intimidate?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and roll an intimidate check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Don't you have some sort of intimidate thing?","response":"DM: He's not in a frenzied rage, though."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, but I'll take Craven Edge out and leave him unsheathed, which gives me an advantage on intimidation checks.\n17.","response":"DM: 17. Okay. You can see now, with the blade forward, sweat dripping down his face, this look of a cornered animal, and as the sword comes out with a ringing sound in the air, the shadows coalesce around the black obsidian blade. He gives you a look and he's questioning his current circumstance, but seems to be holding firm."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: What do I have left of my turn? Anything?","response":"DM: You have your bonus action and your move."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Bonus action. Bonus action. What's a bonus action? What can I do?\nLAURA: I don't know what you can do.","response":"DM: If you're in frenzied rage it would be another attack, but–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: No, that makes me tired as shit. No, I won't do anything else.\nTRAVIS: That'll hit.\nTRAVIS: Halved, because I'm raging.","response":"DM: Plus an additional five points from his superiority die."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: From his what?\nSAM: Superiority.","response":"DM: He's attempting to trip you. Go ahead and make a strength saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Do I have–","response":"DM: Ability checks, not your saving throws."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Strength checks and strength saving throws, advantage.","response":"DM: Is that what it says?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah. Advantage on all strength checks and strength saving throws.","response":"DM: Then yeah, you would have advantage on this."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Haha. 26.","response":"DM: 26. You stand firm in your position. The blade strikes and gashes open a part of your shin, but you just hold your place there, leaning against the wall for support. Doesn't affect you."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: So 13 total halved, so seven?","response":"DM: Mm-hm. Next is going to– You know what, he's going to go ahead and attempt to strike you two more times. That is going to be a 16 to hit?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Misses.\nTRAVIS: That'll hit.\nMARISHA: Okay, I'm going to peek around Grog, and try and cast Hold Person on him.","response":"DM: Okay. What's the DC on that?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 18. Just my spell DC, right?","response":"DM: Okay. Well, that is 17. However, he is going to use Indomitable to reroll a saving throw."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Aw.","response":"DM: That is going to be a 20. So as you finish the spell, you can see his head beginning to be affected and he shrugs it off through sheer force of will. Anything else you want to do on your turn?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This guy's annoying.\nMARISHA: No. Ah! Yes!","response":"DM: Okay. That ends Keyleth's turn. Scanlan, you're up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I just said yes. No, wait, I don't have it, I don't have it. Nope. Never mind. No! Go.","response":"DM: Scanlan, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can't see him yet or I can?","response":"DM: No, not right now. You just see this blade going (whoosh whoosh) out the doorway."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And I saw Keyleth cast that spell, yeah?","response":"DM: Correct, yes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I run up a little closer to be in visual range, yeah?","response":"DM: There you can see him, yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: And I will do the same fucking thing. And I'll cast Hold Person on him as well, with my Hand Cone of Clarity.","response":"DM: Your hand cone. That is a natural one."}
{"prompt":"SAM: He has two?!","response":"DM: Two, but this is his last one. That brings him to a 19."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 19.","response":"DM: Just beats your DC."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He has to make a wisdom saving throw.","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, is that what he was doing against my spell save? Is that what it is?\nSAM: Damn.","response":"DM: Wait, no. That is a 17. Sorry, I misdid the math. So it does go through him. So as you finish the Hold Person, he (groans) locks up into place, tense, his eyes darting around with an angry fury. Anything else you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I will, with my bonus, can I talk to him?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I will say: hey man! Just give up already. Come on! Come on! That's my intimidation.","response":"DM: Make an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 21.","response":"DM: 21. He seems visibly shaken by the presence of the two of you and the fact that he can't move right now. That's the best I can give you at the moment."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we take his weapon from him since he can't move?\nASHLEY: Okay. Can I intimidate him to give me his weapon?\nSAM: He can't move.\nASHLEY: He can't move? Can I go up and try to take his weapon?","response":"DM: If you want to. One, two, three, four, five. So you step up into the hallway. And you walk up to him and he's looking at you, sweat dripping down his face, hair matted across the side of his chin."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do it, Pike!\nMARISHA: Do it.","response":"DM: What are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Please give me your weapon.","response":"DM: Roll an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Get more flies with honey.\nASHLEY: Fuck. Well, it's probably not going to work with a four.","response":"DM: With a four? The eyes– Though frozen, he still manages to roll his eyes, as the armored gnome walks up and requests his weapon, and is no longer paying attention."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I just take it from him?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a strength check. Just roll and add your strength modifier."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's good.\nASHLEY: 18.\nLAURA: Oh wait, it might be higher than that. No.\nASHLEY: 18?","response":"DM: 18. You go and grab and all the muscles tensed up, it's like a vice grip, and as you pull and pull and pull, to no avail. You're unable to wrestle it from his grasp. That ends your turn. Back up. Vex."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm going to just call out: you're being really stupid, obviously. You are outnumbered. You are frozen. You should probably just, you know, give up.\nASHLEY: You have him held?\nSAM: He's held. And also, we probably can't tell if he's giving up because he probably can't talk.\nLAURA: Okay, until Grog. I want to hold my action until Grog gets him to move. Until he moves out of–","response":"DM: Okay. What action do you want to hold? What are you going to do?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Do I have to say what I'm going to–","response":"DM: I want to know what you're readying, essentially."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I want to, if anything attacks us, I want to be able to attack it.\nLIAM: I'm going to wait to see what Grog does. As soon as Grog's done, I'm throwing.","response":"DM: Grog, what are you doing?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can I squeeze by Pike, or do I need to pick her up and move her out of the way?","response":"DM: Technically, being held doesn't threaten the square and you can probably walk around Pike, so you can get into the room. I'd say right now, because he can't really defend it or keep you at bay with his weapon."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Walk, that's cute. I would like to run past Pike and bear-form tackle him.\nTRAVIS: Full shoulder in the gut, wrapping my arms around his legs, picking him up and throwing him on the ground.\nLAURA: Don't you wish we had Trinket now?\nSAM: Oh, it's like football drills? Running into a– What are those things called?\nTRAVIS: Guy's standing up and you're just driving into him with your whole body mass.\nLIAM: Why do we need Trinket? We have a small giant.\nTRAVIS: Okay. Yes! 19.","response":"DM: 19? That's fine. He can't even defend at this point. So you push him back five feet and you manage to push your way into this and shove him further into the room."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: But not to the ground?\nMARISHA: He wanted to take him to the ground.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I wanted to tackle him and be on top of him.","response":"DM: Yeah, you know what (impact sound), on the ground and you are right over, lording the space. Okay. That all you're going to do on your turn?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I can't attack, right? That's all I got?\nTALIESIN: You can move.\nTRAVIS: No. I'll stay there.\nLIAM: Are we able to tell from what Grog just did what he does? Does he react, does he just go (grunts).","response":"DM: He just falls over, because he can't move his muscles."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can we move his muscles or is he frozen?\nSAM: You mean use him like Weekend at Bernie's?\nLAURA: Can we handcuff him while he's frozen?\nMARISHA: That's what I was going to say. Can we tie him? Tie him up?","response":"DM: You can attempt to if you get to him on your turn."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Hog-tie him.","response":"DM: Grog, you finish your turn? Comes to Daxio's turn. Daxio's attempting to resist. That's a natural 20."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Weren't you holding your turn until Grog moved him?\nLIAM: Until Grog did his thing. Yeah, but I wanted to see what happened. So it would be after this.","response":"DM: Right. So as Daxio is on the ground, muscles lax for a second and looks up at you and can't do anything, because that was his turn, but is no longer seemingly affected by the ability. And just looks up at you with eyes flicking around with thoughts and trying to formulate a plan here."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, like what you see, don't you?","response":"DM: Vax, what did you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So the first one is a natural 20. That's also sneak attack, so that doesn't get quadrupled, does it? It's already doubled from sneak attack.","response":"DM: Correct. Well, no, no. It's doubled because it's a critical hit. That's all."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh right. Sneak Attack you just get the additional six, remember?\nLIAM: Yeah. Okay. So– And then the second one is a 23.","response":"DM: 23? Both hit."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. And did I use all my movement to climb through the scrum or do I have my third attack?","response":"DM: The movement wouldn't affect your attack at all. Your movement is just your movement action."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So I do have a third attack, then?","response":"DM: You would in theory, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay, so that's 17.","response":"DM: 17 does hit, yes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Okay. So the first one, blunt, using the end, is–\nLAURA: And then add your six.\nLIAM: 11. Two, three, seven, ten, 15, 19.","response":"DM: 19 times two."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 19 times two, right, is 38. Plus the seven, so 46 for the first.","response":"DM: 46 points of damage."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's blunt, though. And two plus six is eight on the second. And seven on the third.\nLIAM: Did I use all my movement to get there. All of it?","response":"DM: You could try and get away if you like. With Haste you would have more movement, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'll take– I'll go back ten feet. See what happens. He's on his back, so he could probably take a swing at me.","response":"DM: He tries to, but it's with disadvantage."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He's down on the ground?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)\nMARISHA: I was going to say, I can. Okay. Yeah, I'll go ahead and vine him.","response":"DM: Grasping Vine? To where?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: To– Oh, right, because it's got to be against a wall.\nTRAVIS: It can't be the ground?\nMARISHA: Can it be the ground?","response":"DM: It can probably be the ground if you want to, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, can I essentially just entangle him into the ground?\nTALIESIN: While prone.\nMARISHA: Yeah, he's down.\nTALIESIN: That's hot.","response":"DM: So, technically, the spell doesn't grapple, it just pulls things towards it. It just moves things around the battlefield."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, that's right.","response":"DM: So the vine pulls him closer to the ground."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I do Entangle instead and just do a concentrated Entangle?","response":"DM: Entangle would affect the entire floor of that room. Yeah, Grasping Vine– The vine's around him, you don't know how much of an effect it'll have when it comes to his turn, but you'll find out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It may help.\nSAM: You did great!","response":"DM: It was also your bonus action. You can still use your action to cast another second level if you wanted to."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Cast Speak with Animals.\nLAURA: Commune with Nature.\nMARISHA: I mean, I can try and Hold Person him again. Do we want to do that? I can Hold Person him again.\nSAM: We want to hear what he has to say, I think, at this point.\nMARISHA: Can I do a Druidcraft, Matt? A Druidcraft where I druidcraft a vine around his ankles?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, okay, cool.","response":"DM: Out of the Grasping Vine, a little vine goes around the legs. It's more of a grapevine. A really pretty to grow plant life on."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: A grapevine? Grapevines are pretty hard.\nTRAVIS: A white or red grapevine?","response":"DM: A red one. Okay, Scanlan, you're up."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Me? Jesus. Hey! Hey, dude! Come on! Can you give up, please? Can you please give up? I'm just going to intimidate him again.","response":"DM: Okay. Roll an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Come on! Roll so high.\nSAM: Ah, that was a dead roll. That was the same roll, but not wonky. This is intimidate? 22.","response":"DM: Okay. You get the sense now that these rounds of perpetual pressuring Daxio and now recovering his position in this fight and you guys have stepped into this room with him, he's become less of a sensible individual and more of a desperate man lashing out as a last stand. And your intimidation shouts are falling upon deaf ears."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.","response":"DM: Does that end your turn?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't know. Is that my action?","response":"DM: I'd say because you're already there and shouting at him, it can be a bonus action. So if you want to take your action still."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I can't do anything, I'm behind all those fucking people. Well, if we're fighting then, I can't do much. I will just– I will blind him this time.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Can I do that?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'll blind him at a level three.","response":"DM: Ooh, level three blind."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Blind him?\nSAM: Blind.\nTALIESIN: With science.","response":"DM: At level three just means you can target an additional creature."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I know, I just don't have any level two slots.\nSAM: That's 19, so he saves.","response":"DM: Yeah, so he saves, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This guy sucks.\nSAM: Oh wait, I can blind one other person?","response":"DM: If you want to."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Nah, no, I won't.\nASHLEY: Oh, jeez. I don't know what to do. So intimidating is not working?\nLAURA: No.\nASHLEY: Can't we just take him out of there now that he's all tied up?","response":"DM: He's not tied up. The vine grabbed around, but doesn't appear to be really changing his physicality."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. Can I make, with my Spiritual Weapon, a sort of– holding like a–","response":"DM: It's a weapon. Spiritual Weapon. Weapon's in the name. What kind of weapon would you want to summon?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I want to make a lasso again. A lariat. Maybe with a little stinger on the end. Just to listen.\nASHLEY: So his arms–","response":"DM: Well, we'll have to see."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: If it works.","response":"DM: So go ahead and roll and add your spell attack. It has advantage, because he's prone still."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: That would be a natural 20.","response":"DM: He's also now grappled."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: He's also now grappled. Okay. Can the stinger go right here to his neck?","response":"DM: Sure. It's right there. The spiritual energy wraps around the body. He's held there, with the vine both holding him there. The stinger (swish) up over the throat."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Brother. Come on. What are you gonna do?\nTRAVIS: We take him the fuck out of here.\nASHLEY: Yeah, we got to take him out, yeah.","response":"DM: That the end of your turn?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah. But I can still– has he dropped his weapon? No?","response":"DM: The weapon's still clutched to him and wrapped–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I try to intimidate him with my extra bonus attack and tell him to drop his weapon?","response":"DM: You get the sense he can't drop it, because he's currently– everything's wrapped up to him. Between the lasso and the vine. And intimidation doesn't seem to affect him anymore."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.\nLAURA: How long does the spiritual weapon last?","response":"DM: It's concentration so can be a number of rounds as long as she uses her bonus action to maintain it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So concentrated.","response":"DM: Yes, I would recommend it. Vex?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Me? Okay. Oh no, should I go in the room?\nTALIESIN: Room's kind of busy, in my opinion.\nLAURA: I feel like I don't want to. I just, okay. You know what? I'm gonna Hunter's Mark him.","response":"DM: So you're gonna get over– You still can't see him at that distance, unfortunately."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Seriously?","response":"DM: You've stayed at the far back. Um, so."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well then fuck it, I'm gonna just stay where I am.\nTALIESIN: Yeah, let's keep point.\nLAURA: I'm gonna keep point. I'm gonna stay at the back of the hallway, just in case.\nLAURA: Again, still hiding.\nLIAM: Okay. I've still got daggers turned around. I'm gonna knock this fool out. Okay, yeah, and you guys are right on top of him so first one is– and advantage because he's grappled and down, right?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So first one is 22. Second one is a natural 20. Third one is 20.","response":"DM: Well, you can't choose which one is the sneak attack."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Well, there is no sneak attack– oh yeah, yeah. I meant that the critical was on the second one. That's what I meant.","response":"DM: Yeah, no worries."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: So the first one is 11 plus double this. 11 plus four, eight, 12, 15, 16, 22. So that's 44 plus–\nLAURA: You don't double it.\nLIAM: Oh, the second one's the critical attack. Thank you. 22 plus seven is 30. I have three attacks! 31. Second one is– that's easy. 14. And the third attack is ten. The second one was critical, but much smaller.\nLAURA: Who's gonna tie him up? Who's in the fucking room?\nLIAM: And I'm gonna jump back ten feet again.\nLAURA: And pull him out of the room. Anyone?","response":"DM: And Percy, you're holding?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm holding.\nTRAVIS: I'm gonna take manacles out of the Bag of Holding. Since he's holding– his arms are pinned to his chest. And I'm gonna clasp it on both of his wrists. And then I'm gonna pick that motherfucker up on my shoulder and walk out of the room. I'd like to try.\nASHLEY: And I can help.","response":"DM: You can, by just controlling it with your mind. So I will say, go ahead and make an athletics check, just to–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Strength or athletics?","response":"DM: This'd be athletics. Athletics is better for you, technically."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, it is. 20.","response":"DM: Yeah. You lift him over your shoulder, past Pike. Take him out into the hallway. You gonna keep him on your shoulder? Or slam him down?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah, I was gonna slam him into the wall.","response":"DM: Wham, whack, into the wall. Go ahead and roll 1d6 plus your strength modifier. For the sheer force of this, this near currently helpless individual slammed against the stone wall."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Seven.\nLAURA: Can I toss Grog my– some of the infinite rope and tell him to tie him up, tie up his ankles too.\nASHLEY: Loot tying? I mean, rage tying.","response":"DM: Rage tying."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, but he's got his ankles tied up.\nSAM: Not no more he don't.","response":"DM: Yeah, the manacles are there. You turn was to lift him up and slam him into the wall, and you're beginning to wrap him up. His turn immediately afterward is he breaks out of the lasso."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The spirit weapon?","response":"DM: The spirit weapon lasso, and at that point, still manages to (grunts) get back with half the movement onto his feet."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I can't take my turn now, can I?","response":"DM: You can, after this. He still has the manacles on, which holding the polearm now wouldn't do too much of a disadvantage to him. So I say this round it doesn't do anything."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I know, it'd be a close grip.","response":"DM: The grip's pretty tight."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He wouldn't be able to get a firm grip on the swing, it'd be like.\nLIAM: Let him be a hardass.\nMARISHA: As a fight– as a staff user that's–\nASHLEY: Oh no.\nMARISHA: You know what? Bring it, bitch.\nMARISHA: 'Sup?\nMARISHA: Miss.\nMARISHA: 17 is exactly what he needed.\nMARISHA: 15.","response":"DM: 15. With that, slams it around and hits you right about the kneecap. The blade hits the armor and it guards most of it, but the sheer force of the impact knocks you off your feet and you land face-down on the ground, in front. With that, Daxio uses the momentum of the strike to and use the action surge ability. He's gonna do three more strikes against your now-prone self. With disadvantage, and you're prone so each attack has no disadvantage against you."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah.","response":"DM: That's a natural 20."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps)","response":"DM: First one– and these are all Great Weapon Master. This one's gonna be a 23. And this is gonna be a 18. And this one is a 21. So all three hit?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Uh-huh.\nASHLEY: I got you girl.\nMARISHA: Is this all for that staff comment?","response":"DM: It's pretty harsh. But also, given the circumstance that you were, from his perspective, the one that was trying to hold him in place too. And Grog hasn't taken much visual impact from the blows. You're the one that's currently protecting him from rushing off in that direction. Say what you want. But anyway. That is–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, god.","response":"DM: And this last one is 21 points of slashing damage."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: She's out?\nTALIESIN: No. She's standing. Or I mean, she's not, but–","response":"DM: That ends Daxio's turn. You're up, Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh wait!","response":"DM: Oh yeah, Percy, you're making your action, that's right."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm gonna pull grit shot to the hands. With the new pistol.\nLAURA: With the new weapon?\nSAM: That might explode.\nTALIESIN: That's a 21 to hit.","response":"DM: That hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let me double-check.","response":"DM: No, I made a change to that, because– That's gonna be a 21."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Against my?","response":"DM: Against the DC for all your other abilities. So I'm pretty sure that he resists it."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Against my DC?","response":"DM: Against your DC, yeah. So you take your first shot. It does damage– It does no damage, this is the–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: No, this does no damage. I don't know what my DC is.","response":"DM: I think for this one, if I look at the change I made for the update on the gunslinger. Let me go ahead and check real fast. Stay with me folks."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is this gun called Little Sparky?","response":"DM: It's the arms you said, right?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Hands, yeah.","response":"DM: Actually, no, I did not change this one. He doesn't get a saving throw. He drops it, no damage."}
{"prompt":"(clapping)","response":"DM: So as Keyleth is on the ground being hacked by this glaive, he lifts up again for another brutal strike and (shooting sound) this echoing blast sound hits as the glaive is knocked out of his hands."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I just go to my earpiece and I go: Thank you, Percy.\nTALIESIN: Did we– are we going to go with that discussion we had about the torso shot, or are we dropping that for now? Dropping it for now? Totally okay. In that case, I'm just going to take two sharpshooter shots to drag him down a little bit.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That's 18, 19, 20, 27 to hit.","response":"DM: 27 hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: That does– God, new gun, there we are. That's six, 22 points of damage.\nSAM: Yeah, Little Sparky.\nTALIESIN: And that's 17 to hit.","response":"DM: 17 to hit, yeah, just hits."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: And that's 23 points of damage. And that's all she wrote.\n(gasps)\nLAURA: Wait, wait, keep him alive.\nTRAVIS: I don't think we have a chance now.\nTALIESIN: Well, we do.\nMARISHA: Fucking dick, he deserves it.\nTALIESIN: I want to take both of those shots, and try and graze his collarbones with both those shots. It'll heal, but he's gonna have a really hard time lifting his arms, for like the next couple months.","response":"DM: Okay. So with those shots (gunshot) a splash of blood with bits of splintered bone come shooting out of the half-plate armor he's been wearing as the metal itself blows open from the impact of the first blast. With the glaive still clinking to the ground behind him and him reacting, the first impact sends him back and he leans against the wall, looks up to see the source of the impact. Looks into your eyes for a second and before he has a moment of reaction the second blast comes out (gunshot) shattering the other part of the clavicle. You can now see the armor sundered on each shoulder and blood beginning to pour over the sides of where the armor's been torn. He slumps to the ground (groaning)."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You're lucky. It'll even heal.","response":"DM: (panting) “Do what you must. But I am his blood. His dominion will call back, call me back when everything else has fallen into nothing.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are you talking about Dres– Vecna? Are you talking about Vecna?","response":"DM: (low chuckle)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, that's a yes.\nTALIESIN: Oh yeah, that didn't go very well. I'm afraid you might be out of luck.\nLIAM: We've got about 50 more minutes in here. What say we drag this asshole out of here?\nLAURA: Let's get this fucker out of here.\nTALIESIN: Grog, tie him up! And let's get you, do you need–?\nMARISHA: Yeah, Keyleth gets up and bleeding from my mouth. And I just take him and I grab him by his face. and I just say: Fucking traitor. And I spit a big glob of blood in his face.\nTALIESIN: And she's the nice one.\nTRAVIS: I pick him up, I put him over my shoulder and we start to walk out of the hall.\nASHLEY: And I'm gonna heal Keyleth.","response":"DM: Okay. He's– in the process of you tying him up and jostling him over, he falls pretty much nearly unconscious. He's fading in and out of consciousness right now. Every now and then you feel a little chuckle come out of him on your shoulder. (dark chuckle) and then passes out again."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I pick up the glaive also.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Wait, what was I at? 30.\nMARISHA: Oh, that's very good.","response":"DM: What do you do now?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Let's get the fuck out of here.","response":"DM: With Daxio over your shoulder, you guys quickly head back into the hallway, emptied, the doorway still lies open as you guys left it. And–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I get that piece of chalk and in thieves' cant I'm going to write on the wall: Much appreciated, Uriel sends his regards, V.\nTRAVIS: Do we want to check those other rooms?\nLAURA and LIAM: No.\nSAM: Oh, what about the room he was in?\nLIAM: No.\nSAM: What do you mean no? What if he had– he had stuff to travel with.\nLAURA: That's true, he had a lot of money with him.\nTALIESIN: I'll do a quick rummage of it. Very quick.\nLAURA: I'm gonna hang out by the door, I'm gonna let him hang out.\nTALIESIN: I'm an idiot, so I'm going to roll a six.\nSAM: I'm going to go in and do it too.\nASHLEY: Can I wedge the door open or something?\nSAM: 20.","response":"DM: You guys take a few more moments, thankfully there's no real pressure. you have plenty of time going forward. You guys go through the room. Underneath his bed, up inside the actual wooden frame of the bed itself, in part of the cushion, you feel there is a large sack of something. You pull it out and–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'll hang on to that. I need it.\nLAURA: I'm sure you do, but you lost yours so I'm gonna hold on to it for you.\nTALIESIN: You've proven to be irresponsible.\nSAM: I have had the most money of all of us.\nLAURA: I take it.","response":"DM: It contains, I'll say for the sake of– you're probably counting it as you go up the stairs, because you're Vex. 3,002 gold pieces."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm back to normal.\nTALIESIN: No, you're not. Because it's–\nSAM: I found it.\nTALIESIN: I know, but we took it away from you.\nSAM: No you didn't.\nTALIESIN: Yes we did.\nSAM: You didn't even find it.\nTALIESIN: We saw you find it.\nTRAVIS: Excuse me, no interest in the other rooms, or shall we leave?\nTALIESIN: Let's just go.\nLIAM: We're outstaying our welcome, let's go now.\nTRAVIS: We could set it on fire.\nMARISHA: The cooks are back in the kitchen?","response":"DM: If you glance around and you look, you can listen. You do hear the sound of pots and various sounds–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: What the fuck are the cooks gonna do?\nTRAVIS: We're on the fucking council.\nMARISHA: Yeah, I mean, what are they gonna do now? Oh, hang on. Are we about to walk through a very crowded bar?\nLAURA: No, we're not. We're going to leave through the alley, where Trinket is waiting. We can toss him over Trinket's back. We just walk on out.\nTRAVIS: We just walk through the kitchen.","response":"DM: You guys head up to the kitchen, as you guys come stomping up in succession, carrying the bleeding and unconscious Daxio on the back, the younger gentleman who's working in the kitchen who's in the middle of cooking something in a large cast iron pan, goes: “You can't be in here!”"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: We're leaving, we're leaving!\nTALIESIN: And my compliments to the chef. Good night.","response":"DM: And then you guys head back into the alleyway. Trinket eagerly (bear grunts)."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hey darling.","response":"DM: Licks your face. (slurping sounds)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Could you do us a favor and carry him?","response":"DM: Comes up to you and nudges you to–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I tell them: I'll catch up, guys. I have to say goodbye to my mates.\nTALIESIN: Can we frisk him while we're waiting?\nLAURA: I like it. Can I dig in his pockets?","response":"DM: Digging in his pockets, you find a strange holy symbol that appears to be a skull that is missing the left side of its face."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I do a religion check on it?","response":"DM: Yeah, go for it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 15.","response":"DM: 15. Based on the conversations you've had with the party and the seeming subtle rise of worshipers of Vecna, intertwined with the Whitestone scenario, this is a symbol of Vecna. It's not a holy symbol per se, more than it's just some sort of a token or some sort of a– it has a purpose that isn't magical."}
{"prompt":"SAM: It is magic?\nASHLEY & TRAVIS: It's not.\nSAM: Hi, hi, sorry I disappeared there for a while, I just got a little distracted. Just wanted to say it was wonderful running into you, if you'll be around for another week, you said?","response":"DM: “Another week, yes.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: It's actually called Greyskull Embassy, now.","response":"DM: “I'll see you at your keep.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: And I turn to– what is her name? Kaylie?","response":"DM: Kaylie, who is already behind you, as you turn she goes, “Greyskull Keep, is it?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes, it is. My room's on the second floor.\nMARISHA: Playing the long game, I like it.","response":"DM: You step out of the tavern and meet with the rest of your allies, and as the sun sets on the distant western sky over Emon, Vox Machina makes its way back to its keep, with its current quarry. And we'll end it for tonight, unless you–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We're taking him to Uriel, right?\nLIAM: Just as a minor detail, as we're walking, almost like a magic trick, I wanna grab my cloak and yank it off Pike and wrap it up and put it into my pocket.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We're taking him to Uriel, we're taking him to Uriel.","response":"DM: The flowers are still standing."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: We're not taking him to our place, we're taking him to Uriel.","response":"DM: Are you going to your keep, or are you going to Uriel?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: To Uriel.","response":"DM: Then you make a quick turn and start heading back towards the Cloudtop District. And that's where we'll end it for the evening!"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Walk off into the sunset, credits roll, they turn right.\nMARISHA: Oh shit, forgot.\nTALIESIN: Freeze frame!\nLAURA: 2,600 gold to get some booty, I like it.\nASHLEY: Oh, we didn't get to talk about your sword!","response":"DM: No, never had an opportunity to discuss it."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Nope, haven't had a minute.","response":"DM: I guess you'll have to Skype in next week."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I might be able to.","response":"DM: If you can, that'd be awesome."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Don't make me talk to him, because it won't go well.\nASHLEY: No no no, no. We just didn't get a chance to talk to him about his sword.","response":"DM: Well, cool. Back in the swing of things, our first game of the year, got some story beats completed, and some other mysteries put in there, just a fun little step into Scanlan's old world, that was pretty cool."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah! Scanlan backstory.\nSAM: I wanna get some more into that!","response":"DM: Oh, and we're dropping shit."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, popcorn down. So next week we're doing Critmas, next week.\nSAM: Oh, their troupe? The troupe name? Oh man, I wrote that three years ago. I have no idea.","response":"DM: I know. I wrote it down in a document that I didn't print out. But I will for future shows. So Dr. Dranzel–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We'll look it up on the break.","response":"DM: Yeah, there you go. It had a great performance troupe."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Magical Mystery Band.","response":"DM: Yeah, that's the one. And discovered a number of past individuals of Scanlan's performance history as well as a few new friends and got into an epic flute duel of which he threw and in doing so, being a man of his word, gave the remaining gold coins in his pouch to a young gnome."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Just the worst.\nSAM: It was worth it.\nLAURA: Was it?\nSAM: Well, we'll find out.\nTALIESIN: It's like a Tom Waits song.","response":"DM: Yeah, with the distraction being successful the rest of the party snuck through the kitchen into the hatch and they had an encounter with the Clasp after calling out to them within their own hideout. Telling them that they were after this fugitive and not planning to do any terrible business in the guild and managed to convince them to let them go about their way and Vox Machina had a showdown with the traitor, Riskel Daxio, within his cell, before he was supposed to be ushered out of the city, given a new name, and essentially be given free rein in the world. The party then beat him down pretty hard and are currently dragging his bleeding, unconscious corpse towards the Cloudtop District to turn him in."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Right. That's right. He's not dead.\nTALIESIN: It's an unconscious corpse. Which means it's technically–\nMARISHA and TALIESIN: Not a corpse.","response":"DM: This is true. I don't know why I said corpse."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Foreshadowing!\nLAURA: Oh, no. What are we going to do?","response":"DM: A near corpse. He is borderline corpse."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Mostly dead. Not all dead.","response":"DM: So, as you guys make your way towards the center of Emon, the central wall that surrounds the Cloudtop District comes into view and the front gates that face the southwestern side of the city reveal themselves down the thoroughfare. There you see the four guards that are posted at that entrance notice you approaching and immediately two of them begin to come up to you. And you've interacted with these individuals a few times as your experiences here in the city so far and they've grown to recognize you just by appearance and you guys tend to stroll up as a posse of confidence, which draws their attention."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Fucking with my clique.","response":"DM: Exactly."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We're Reservoir Dogging it.\nLAURA: 'Sup.\nTALIESIN: Walking really slow.","response":"DM: At this point the sun is setting, it's probably getting close to dusk. You guys stroll up and the two guards approach immediately. “Can I ask you what you're doing here? You've got someone–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We have a present for Uriel. Open the gates.","response":"DM: “Well, what's the present?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are you questioning part of the council at this moment?","response":"DM: “No, if there is business to be done I have to go ahead and put it up the chain of command to make sure that I'm doing my job so I don't end up being lashed for my–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course, darling, and you're doing a wonderful job of it.\nLAURA: We have a present for Uriel. Open the gates. Send it up the chain of command.","response":"DM: Turns around and walks back, the other guy looks back awkwardly and follows him. He gives a couple hand motions and the gates open up to the inside of the Cloudtop District."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He's on the back of the bear, right?\nSAM: The bear we left at home.\nTALIESIN: The bear we left in the alley.\nLAURA: He is with us. What?\nSAM: Next time. Next time.\nTALIESIN: The bear is a necessity.\n(groaning)\nTRAVIS: We take him inside.\nLAURA: Wait a minute!\nTRAVIS and SAM: What?\nLAURA: Where's Trinket right now?! Why isn't he on the set?!\nSAM: Where is Trinket?\nMARISHA: He's in the alley.\nLAURA: I'm getting him right now.\nTRAVIS: No, no, no, no. Come on.\nLAURA: I know where he is.\nLIAM: Look Sam, what did you do?\nSAM: This is just like when David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear.","response":"DM: It's just like it. Exactly."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yep. David Copperfield? Feld?\nMARISHA: It's amazing because you can like hear her footsteps. It's like a cartoon.\nTALIESIN: It's like an ad for Atmos Surround, you hear (ticking noises).\nMARISHA: It's totally like a Pixar intro.\nTALIESIN: Oh my god.","response":"DM: I'm excited for the prospect of watching this happen right now."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Nothing can go wrong. This is a great idea.\nMARISHA: No one help her.\nLIAM: No one help her.\nTALIESIN: She can do this.","response":"DM: You got this, Laura. You got this."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: You got it. You got it.\nLAURA: Help me. Can you see this?\nTRAVIS: Nope.\nLAURA: Travis, move your butt! I've got to get Trinket through!\nSAM: Travis can move, he's not going to help you.\nLAURA: Please, Travis.","response":"DM: This is a wonderful microcosm analogy for pretty much every session."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, he's here!","response":"DM: Yay! Well done."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Totally worth it. Is he good? Is he placed well, you guys?\nTRAVIS: Sure.\nSAM: That's a good core body workout.\nLAURA: Oh my gosh, I'm so strong.\nMARISHA: This was the best opening of our show.","response":"DM: What's your strength?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Very low.","response":"DM: So, pushing towards the central palace, the guards approach once again. These ones a little more stern than the ones you met on the outside of the district. “What's your business at the palace?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Again?\nLAURA: We, look, we have a body over this bear! Let us through to Uriel; he's been looking for this man. Super important.","response":"DM: The guards look over at the bear."}
{"prompt":"SAM: They know this man. They should know this man.","response":"DM: “You found Riskel Daxio?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Of course we did!\nMARISHA: But don't tell him! It's a surprise. It's a present.","response":"DM: The other guards begin to step forward like, “We'll take it from here.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No no no. No, you won't.\nTRAVIS: The fuck you will.\nTALIESIN: We would like to deliver this personally as we don't know if he has any co-conspirators, so it would be best if he didn't leave our immediate vicinity.\nMARISHA: And we really want to see his face when he opens it. That's the best part of giving a gift.\nTALIESIN: Vex, this is all yours.\nLAURA: Oh, well, not all me. This is all of us. We found your traitor for you.","response":"DM: “Really?” And he stands up and the rest of the guards that came up behind you keep an eye to make sure nothing weird goes wrong, they step forward a few steps and, “Bring him forth. Hold him. In irons. Chains. Now.” And all the guards go and pull him off of Trinket, throw him on the ground face-first. He slaps into the marble flooring of the chamber."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah.","response":"DM: Little bit of blood smeared across the ground as his face glides–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yeah, he's beat up pretty bad, you might not want to–","response":"DM: “He'll survive.” And you can see now there's a look of pained anger in Uriel's eyes at seeing the face of someone he trusted for so long. The guards take the manacles that you guys already had on him and chain his legs together. They put another set of manacles across the back of his arms so his arms are actually held in two places to the back. They lift him onto his knees and drag him up to the very bottom stair that leads up to the central dais where the thrones are on. And he's unconscious, head lolling about. Uriel looks down and, “Wake him up.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Us?","response":"DM: “Someone. I don't care. Wake him up.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I got it! I walk over and I slap the shit out of him.\nSAM: You may kill him.\nLIAM: Oh, he's dead.","response":"DM: With a resounding slap sound, Riskel sends a spatter of spittle and blood that coasts across the floor and his head shakes. As he looks up at you, you can see his teeth that were once white now glisten with fresh blood across the entirety of his smile."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hello, gorgeous.","response":"DM: “Do what you will.” He looks up and sees Uriel. “My liege, what would you have of me?” Uriel takes a moment, intensely staring at his face. “For so many years you played me and my family. You played the people of this city, of these lands. You've forsaken the name of your father who plucked you from nothing. How? How can you live with this?” Riskel takes a moment, chuckles to himself, this throaty gurgle as he's still trying to breathe through the blood pooling in the back of his throat. “Life is but a stage of our existence. And when you all will die, I will rise again. For I am his blood.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You are his blood?","response":"DM: Uriel steps back up on his throne and sits down. “Riskel Daxio, you have been found guilty of treason by the peoples of Tal'Dorei. I command that your sentence of death be held immediately.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yes!\nSAM: Sovereign, if I may, can we ask him a few questions before you do what you gonna do?","response":"DM: “Quickly.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: He's talking crazy, we should find out why, right?\nTRAVIS: Who's talking crazy?\nSAM: He said, “I am born of his blood.” What blood?\nLAURA: Are you one of Vecna's children? Are you one of his priests? Are you one of his–\nLIAM: You're the chatty Cathy. Get with the talking.\nSAM: I don't know what I'm asking.\nTRAVIS: You never do.","response":"DM: As you ask him that, “There are many parts to our one to him. I'm but his blood, but there are many, many, different pieces that make the whole.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Where are these pieces located?\nLAURA: Everywhere. Good answer.\nMARISHA: So when you say you are his blood you actually mean more literally for once? Is that what I'm getting?\nSAM: No.\nTRAVIS: Good question.","response":"DM: His eyes narrow and he looks for a moment almost disappointed in confusion. “Just kill me now. I grow impatient with this existence.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's not a problem. Is there somewhere where you would like to go after you die? Or are you going to wake up right after you die?","response":"DM: “I guess we'll find out.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah, and are you going to wake up like a baby so we have like 20 years before we have to worry about you again?\nLAURA: Or are you like a zombie, straight, straight away up and at 'em?\nTRAVIS: He might come back as like a dog.","response":"DM: “Please, please, kill me now. End this paltry existence.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What if you come back as like a fish and then you're screwed and stuck in the water?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, or like a penguin, so he's like a bird that can't fly and he can only swim.\nLAURA: And he's stuck waddling around. That'd be so sad.\nLIAM: Uriel. As thanks for bringing you this gift, we need to run Grog out once in a while. Might he have the honor of removing this shitstain from the world?\nLAURA: Unless, of course, you'd like to do it yourself.","response":"DM: Uriel contemplates for a moment. “He's at your disposal. I only ask that you do it soon and in my sight.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Are you sure there's no more useful information we can get from this man?\nLIAM: So, Riskel, Grog can do it kind of quickish or take a very long time. I've seen him do it.\nTRAVIS: And I start stretching.\nLAURA: Digit by digit.\nLIAM: You can be sent on your way to whatever asshole you think you're going to, but he can make it very uncomfortable.\nLAURA: He could strip you of all your limbs and leave you hanging. Not dead.\nLIAM: I once saw him kill a man with his taint.\nSAM: With his own taint.","response":"DM: Roll an intimidation check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The taint intimidation.\nLIAM: So juicy.\nLAURA: Ew!\nTRAVIS: Like balsamic vinaigrette.\nTALIESIN: I've wanted to make this pun my entire life.\nLIAM: Intimidation, you said. Oh, hell, I'm using Luck in case I can do better. No, 17.\nTALIESIN: He taint intimidated. Got to get it out of my system. I'm so sorry.","response":"DM: You can see his eyes begin to roll back in his head. “Do what you must.” Begins to fade back into unconsciousness."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, no, no. Wake up, wake up, wake up. What's the marble? What's the little ball? What's it do?","response":"DM: “I don't know what you're talking about.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, then you're not very knowledgeable, are you? I guess Vecna didn't tell you of his plans. Not very important. Blood?","response":"DM: “The deal with my master is power through not knowing. He is the one who knows all. The fact that he keeps it from us means that he trusts us.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.\nSAM: Wait, wait, wait, wait. We're not going to get any information out of him?\nTRAVIS: Well, maybe we should have Pike cleanse his blood so he won't come back after he dies.\nLAURA: That's a good idea! Pike, why don't you bless him? Why don't you make him holy?","response":"DM: His eyes dart around for a moment with a look of sudden curiosity and worry."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh, I think that would be fun!","response":"DM: “That's not possible.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes, it is. Sarenrae could always use new servants. Right, Pike?\nASHLEY: Yes, of course!\nTALIESIN: I've seen her regrow a foot. It's amazing.","response":"DM: Deception check."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The good one!\nLAURA: Aw, that's not the good one. 11. Do I get advantage because Pike is helping?","response":"DM: Because she is helping with it and she is the source of it, I'd say sure. Go ahead and roll with advantage."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Haha! That's much better. 23!","response":"DM: 23. Okay. You can see now at this point, his breathing is quickened and he's swallowing more regularly. There's a look of sincere nervousness in his eyes. “His power is great. There is nothing this paltry little child of a being can do to keep his will from his promise.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, you shithead.\nASHLEY: Well, maybe we'll just give it a try.\nTRAVIS: Do it! Do it!\nASHLEY: Okay, well, I'm going to walk over to him. Just stay still. It's better on the light side, so hold on.\nTALIESIN: It worked for me. It was really quite an experience.","response":"DM: “Master have mercy.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You're looking in the wrong direction.\nLAURA: I mean, do you know– Unless you have something to share with us. Do you know of his awakening?\nTRAVIS: We could just let you go to him.\nLAURA: Do you have any details? Something that could lead us to him? Your god of secrets?\nLIAM: No, he's too strong. Fill him with holy light, Pike. Do it now.\nLAURA: You're right. And then he'll help us for sure.\nASHLEY: Yeah, because maybe he'll remember and tell us.\nLAURA: Yeah.\nASHLEY: Okay. Wait. Am I doing Greater Restoration?","response":"DM: If you want to. It's whatever you want to try."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Let's try it!","response":"DM: Okay! So as you pull out your symbol of Sarenrae, your metallic clinks of your feet across the sparse marble flooring. You approach as the symbol glows. You can see in Pike's eyes, her pupils go white as the energy of Sarenrae's holy blessing begins to spill out the sides. At each step, Riskel begins to twitch and pull away. He's glancing about, looks towards you, Grog, with a look of “please, have pity.” As Pike reaches out to touch him, he goes, “I know little. It is the nature of his being. The ritual was once attempted before. I know not if it worked. I was not there. You rushed in. It was not time. ”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What did it need? What would have made it time?","response":"DM: “The Winter's Crest. The festival marks a time where the barrier between the realms is thin. Where the magic ley lines across this world cross and swell. You forced our hand. I was not there. I do not know the answer and I hope it was enough.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It probably wasn't.\nSAM: Are there plans to attempt this at the next Winter's Crest that you know of?","response":"DM: At this point you can see now this look of despair hits his eyes, and then resolve. He goes from this fearful moment to the realization that he has already expressed more than he should. But hopefully it's not too much to fall out of the favor of his lord. And a smile creeps across his face for the first time since this whole thing and he grins. “It is time.” And he leans forward and puts his neck out."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Vecna's going to be so pissed at you.\nMARISHA: Have we tried to Restoration him first?\nSAM: Oh, yeah. She didn't do it yet.\nMARISHA: She didn't do it yet, right?","response":"DM: Did you want to cast the spell on him?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: And then we'll kill him!\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nASHLEY: Should I do it?\nSAM: Why not? We'll see what happens.\nLIAM: So I crouch down, take two fingers and I get him by the nostrils and pull back the top of his head and say, “Do it, Pike. Pour in your holy light right in his mouth. Give it all to him.”","response":"DM: Pike, as you reach forward, you take the Sarenrae symbol and you jam it into his open mouth. As it does– yeah, just like that. A burst of divine light comes spewing out the sides, and you see him choking on some unseen force."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: A holy dick.","response":"DM: Probably a combination of him swallowing his own tongue, but as you pull the symbol back, completing the spell of restoration, you can see the energy pour through his body and he's shaking."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! Did it kill him? Did Greater Restoration just kill him?","response":"DM: He's choking."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hold on. Hold on. And I stick my fingers into his mouth and I grab his tongue and pull it down to–\nLAURA: Oh gosh, this is so terrible.\nLIAM: This guy's an asshole!\nLAURA: I know. I know.\nTALIESIN: That's a big hand to get in there, man. That's really uncomfortable.\nLIAM: He earned this grief.","response":"DM: You hear Uriel's voice behind you say, “Enough. Get it over with.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sorry. Sorry.\nLAURA: That was really awesome, Pike.\nTRAVIS: Nobody else has any other questions?\nTALIESIN: Just keep it clean so we can burn everything afterwards.\nASHLEY: Wait, what happened to him?\nTRAVIS: I take out Craven Edge, and I step back, and with a huge swing aim right under his trin.\nLAURA: Trin?","response":"DM: Trin. As the blade is drawn from Grog's back, you can see it draws this trail of shadow behind it almost through the slow arc as he rears it back for the swing. As the blade with a flash, impossibly fast, arcs its way across Riskel's throat, you can see his eyes open up with a sudden realization as the moment of pain and death hits him. Then a smile draws across his lips as the head slowly rolls back. The blood then gouts out with the last pumps of his heart. His body slumps forward, the guards holding him as they can, spilling a pool out in the center of the floor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh jeez, Uriel.","response":"DM: As this happens, Grog, you feel this wave of exhilaration. This almost ecstatic pulse of joy comes across your body. This sense of taking his life with this blade, the first time you've really actually used it, was delightful."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I've got goose pimples. Was that good for you guys or what?\nSAM: I don't know if you should be smiling this much. You just killed a man. Have a little respect.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, but he was evil. Not happy time?\nTALIESIN: Quiet happy time.","response":"DM: Uriel stands up. “Guards, have this mess cleaned. Burn the body. Thank you very much.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Really quickly, have we looted the body already?\nLAURA: I feel like I did, didn't I? When he was in–","response":"DM: You did, you already looted the body."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We did. We already got the skull with the missing eye.\nTRAVIS: Can I turn to the side and go, how was that?","response":"DM: You hear the voice creep up and say, “Now we see eye to eye.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I don't see you anywhere?","response":"DM: The aura of the shadow from the blade retracts, and the blade becomes an onyx blade. It appears to have rescinded his presence."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: He's shy.\nLIAM: I'm sorry, but it's like The Odd Couple.\nSAM: Craven Edge and Grog!\nASHLEY: Oh man, I so badly want to fix that sword to save Grog, but at the same time, I don't!\nSAM: Sovereign?","response":"DM: “Yes?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You know, I know we just talked earlier today and everything, but it feels like we should get some sort of reward or something for capturing this guy, doesn't it? I mean is that impolite to ask?\nTRAVIS: We did do it pretty expediently.\nSAM: It was the same day, wasn't it?","response":"DM: “It was.” And he sits there for a second and nods his head. “Very well. We were prepared to put out a bounty for his arrest, and I feel it would only be fair to provide you with this bounty.” He snaps his fingers. A guard comes up and he whispers to him for a second. As he walks away, \"You will have a sum of 5,000 gold pieces delivered to Greyskull Keep this evening.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Thank you.","response":"DM: “I appreciate it. Now please, be on your way. I have business to attend to. Thank you very much.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Good evening, your lordship.","response":"DM: He gets up and walks away."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 5,000?\nLAURA: Feel like it could have been more, honestly. Whatever.\nTRAVIS: Really? It's a lot.\nLAURA: Should I add that now, or should I wait until it actually gets delivered?\nSAM: Probably when it gets delivered. It could be intercepted and stolen on the way.\nTALIESIN: A lot could happen.\nTRAVIS: Why would you even say that? Why would you even put that out there?\nLAURA: What should we do? Should we go home, then?\nSAM: I suppose so. It's been a long day. We've taken damage today. We should go home.\nASHLEY: Yeah. We should go heal.\nTRAVIS: Wasn't there something we were going to do, though?\nMARISHA: What time is it?","response":"DM: By now, the sun's probably set, and so as you step out of the palace, you look up at the skyline. Little plumes of clouds throughout, but you can see the distinct bright oranges and purples of sunset have taken, and to the far east, you can see the dark blue of creeping night."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: How long has the sun been down?","response":"DM: It just set. It's heading toward dusk."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Who wants to get a drink?\nMARISHA: Yeah!\nSAM: We were just in a tavern all day.\nMARISHA: Yeah, but that was work.\nTRAVIS: We weren't really drinking. We were pretend drinking. We could be real drinking.\nMARISHA: Were we supposed to be pretend– yeah, sure.\nLAURA: Now the door incident really makes sense, if some of us were really drinking in that tavern.\nTRAVIS: That, or we just hate doors. Let's go get a drink!\nSAM: Same tavern?\nALL: No.\nMARISHA: Let's go to old faithful. Where's old faithful?\nTALIESIN: Let's do faithful.\nTRAVIS: Or do we want to branch out?\nMARISHA: Find a new place?\nTRAVIS: Yeah. Taste some new ale!\nTALIESIN: Let's start a pub crawl.\nTALIESIN and MARISHA: Pub crawl!\nLAURA: I like it a lot.\nTRAVIS: You are a smart one.\nLAURA: What's the closest pub here?","response":"DM: Who's leading the pub crawl?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Wait, hold on. (high-pitched cries) I'm Yelping it.\nSAM: No?\nTALIESIN: I feel so much better for every terrible thing I've said. Oh my god.\nLAURA: That was the worst one you've ever said.\nLAURA: You're going to lose experience points for this.\nTRAVIS: I feel like my intelligence went down one.","response":"DM: There's no ruleset for reverse inspiration. But I'm going to start looking into designing that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: The entire party's intelligence goes to one.\nTALIESIN: You get a 1d10 bonus against a roll versus him. It's to knock him down a peg.","response":"DM: It's like the fate chips system. It's great. Okay. So who's heading the pub crawl?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Am I heading the pub crawl?\nSAM: You don't know this town. Who knows this town the best?\nLAURA: None of us know this town.\nMARISHA: I mean, it's technically our town. We should get to know our city, you guys.\nLAURA: Oh, good.\nTRAVIS: You can't really do this wrong.","response":"DM: You'd be surprised."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: This is the worst pub crawl ever! This took two hours?","response":"DM: Yeah. You find about four different establishments, but most of them appear to be less of the “party hardy” crowd and more of the “my life sucks, I need alcohol” crowd."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Scanlan? Scanlan? I feel we need you. I'm still recovering my spirit here.\nTALIESIN: It couldn't hurt.","response":"DM: 18. Chatting around–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Where's a good place to go? I'm looking for a speakeasy. Something off the beaten path.","response":"DM: Something off the beaten path. Word of mouth type place. Okay. Let's see."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh! I like that he's checking out his Yellow Pages.\nLIAM: Matt's thinking about all the battle maps he drew over the last week, and we're doing a pub crawl.\nTALIESIN: It's like, “Fine. We're doing a pub crawl.”","response":"DM: Hey, man. Nothing wrong with that."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Or just a place that comes highly recommended.\nTALIESIN: Or poorly recommended.","response":"DM: So, you eventually hear about a place called Howarth's. Howarth's."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Like H-O-A–","response":"DM: Howarth's."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Have we been to Howarth's?\nLIAM: He just made it up. We've not been there.\nMARISHA: Like Woolworth's, but Halworth's?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Like “Hogwarts” without the G?","response":"DM: I guess you'd say. Howarth's. When you get there, it appears to be more of a textile business, but from what you've heard, it's more a business that runs the front, and then the real company is in the back."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice.\nTALIESIN: Textiles and beer?","response":"DM: Yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Okay.","response":"DM: So as soon as you guys approach, the guy who's running the front, who's this weaselly-looking, mousy gentleman in his late 40s, thin John Waters mustache, gives you a nod and says, “I take it you're not here for the– yeah. Just around the corner. Back room.” Points you over. As you guys walk in, there's a pretty happening establishment in here. There's a harp player on the far edge of the room on the stage, who's playing a very beautiful piece. Even though she's just playing the harp, it's almost emanating the sound of multiple instruments. There's probably about ten or so people in here. It's not extremely crowded, but everyone in there appears to be rather upper crust folks that either have descended from the Cloudtop District to rub shoulders with the less elite of the town and a few wealthy merchants. It's a pretty decent place for rabble rousers who have some coin to spend."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's us.\nSAM: Let's get a round, shall we?\nLAURA: Yeah. Oh, I would say you could buy, Scanlan, but you have no money.\nSAM: You gave me a thousand gold.\nLAURA: I did, so you have enough to buy for everyone.\nSAM: I'm feeling generous. I'll buy us a round.\nSAM: Should we go home?\nMARISHA: No! Guys. The evening is our– what do they say about things like that? The evening is our oyster. Right? Isn't that what they say?\nLAURA: Sure.\nASHLEY: Yeah, close.\nMARISHA: What?\nASHLEY: No, I said it's pretty close.\nMARISHA: Oh, thank you, Pike. Let's stay out all night. Come on.\nLIAM: Come on, old man!\nMARISHA: We can see the sunrise. We never do this. We never take time for ourselves.\nLAURA: Oh no. Keyleth's been day-drinking and night-drinking.\nMARISHA: I have.\nSAM: She's that girl.\nMARISHA: Come on, you guys.\nLIAM: I'm walking up to the barkeep and I say, Hi!\nLAURA: Oh god, that's so loud.\nLIAM: We need to keep drinking, but also eating, so where's the closest place to do that?\nMARISHA: Yes!","response":"DM: “At this hour?” And the gentleman who's talking to you now, his chin appears to have been broken at some point in his life so as he talks the jaw swivels from side to side in an awkward, old Disney cartoon way. It's hard to really put into words. His hair is spotty in places, it's thinning in the front, but he's well-dressed. It's one of those things where the outfit does not match the persona. But he looks over to you and, “Well, sir, at this point in the evening, food might be a little hard to procure, unfortunately.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, really?","response":"DM: “As far as I know.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Guys, there's got to be like some street vendors. Come on.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to find the most interesting, boisterous clientele in the bar and I'm going to approach them.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we getting in a fight?\nTALIESIN: No.\nLIAM: Not yet.","response":"DM: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Thank you for that. Yes! That's much better. 20.","response":"DM: Okay. As you're glancing about and you're talking to the bar, and the rest of you guys are finishing a round of drinks, you are looking around–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I just remembered 5,000 gold is being delivered to the keep.\nSAM: Don't worry. We have servants.\nMARISHA: We have servants. It's fine.\nTRAVIS: Drink more.","response":"DM: So you glance towards the door and an individual walks in that definitely matches the expectation of what you're looking for. A familiar individual. A gentleman of purple-gold trimmed robes, a darkish complexion, a tied goatee, and a smile on his face. And it suddenly makes complete sense this is the kind of place that Gilmore would go to drink."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN and MARISHA: Gilmore!\nLIAM: Look at this motherfucker right here!","response":"DM: “Vax'ildan!” He runs up and grabs you and (kiss kiss)."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh, I lift him. I lift him in the air and twirl him around and I put him down on a bar stool and I give him a playful slap on the cheek. Not that hard, but like. How are you? It's so good to see you! God, you look good.","response":"DM: “You as well, my friend, you as well.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Gilmore! Gilmore. What are you drinking? We're buying. What are you drinking?","response":"DM: “Oh, obviously whatever she's having.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Do you have any food? They don't have any.","response":"DM: “They don't have any. They would not serve food here. No, it's a finer establishment.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where can we go for food, Gilmore?","response":"DM: “Um.” And he thinks for a second. He reaches back into a small satchel he has at his side and he pulls out a little pouch. He opens the pouch, and he reaches out and he pulls out a small wooden domino, like in size. “If you wouldn't mind clearing some of these tables for me?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh sure, sure. Grog?\nTRAVIS: Not a problem. Stand up, you lot!\nSAM: Gilmore!\nMARISHA: These things are not cheap.\nASHLEY: Gilmore!","response":"DM: You can see in his other hand the gem-encrusted chalice from the middle of his pouch dissipates in the arcane energy. He says, “Well, I figured it was a special occasion.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Darling.\nSAM: Wow, Gilmore, this is too much! Really. This is amazing. You're such a kind, generous soul.","response":"DM: “Actually, I've gotten word that you've been spreading the wonders of my brand, though–”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Everywhere we go.","response":"DM: “That's not true, but you've been doing it a bit, which is more than I expected, to be honest. \"So I appreciate that, I really do.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Something respectable for a change!","response":"DM: “Oh, I don't know about that. I've still got to finish building my shop in Westruun, but when that is done, I'll be more than happy to look into it.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: If you need any help, count on us.","response":"DM: “Whitestone. Whitestone. Hmm. Place has been kind of dour as of late.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Up-and-coming. I tell you that much.\nTALIESIN: Really turning around. Really turning around.\nLIAM: You can turn a coin and do right by the world. They are in need, and that place is going to explode, I'm telling you. Can I get another drink, please?\nMARISHA: They're even changing the name, they're making it more hip, it's going to be called WhiSto now. It's great. Just shortening it.\nTALIESIN: Another for her as well.\nSAM: She's had one drink.\nMARISHA: This is great.\nTRAVIS: When do we tell her that's a Shirley Temple?\nMARISHA: Look, it's been fermenting for a while.","response":"DM: So as the drinks continue to flow, you guys swap stories, you converse. The evening is drawing closer to like the 1:30-2:00 in the morning, at this point. Most of the other patrons have filtered out of the bar. The Heroes' Feast, after finishing being consumed, itself has reverted back down to the wooden domino, which is a different enchantment to what you're used to. Your more druidic, divine-based Heroes' Feast you summon out of the actual element. This is almost an implement or a focus he uses for the spell each time. It's a different way of getting the same effect. Interesting to you, not being an arcane caster. But nevertheless, as it winds down a bit, you guys are all finding yourselves settling in."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I sit down and talk to Gilmore for a moment?","response":"DM: Of course."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And Keyleth gets up and moves and sits next to Vax.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I go and challenge Grog to a dart game.\nTRAVIS: Yes.\nLAURA: Gilmore?","response":"DM: “Yes, my dear?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We ran into a really weird thing in Whitestone, and I bet you know some shit about it, because you know shit about everything.","response":"DM: “Weird things in particular, is that what you're insinuating?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Kind of, yeah.\nLAURA: Vecna?","response":"DM: The moment you say that, you see his jovial exterior harden for a second, and his eyes close and he goes, “That's a strange name to bring up this late in the evening.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Bad news bears, right?","response":"DM: “Yeah.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Thank you. But yeah. There's a spinning ball of death, really. An orb that sucks things into it. It's black. It's underground. We don't know what to do with it really and I'm kind of worried, I guess, about it.","response":"DM: “Spinning black orb of death…”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: They were trying to wake him up, but they said it was too early. They did it before Winter's Crest.","response":"DM: He thinks for a second and says, “The only orb of spinning death I'm familiar with is a Sphere of Annihilation, but those are generally a bit larger than what you're describing to me, at the very least.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Well, I feel like maybe they wanted it to get bigger? I don't know. Oh! Oh! There was a hand, and an eye, and–","response":"DM: “Those generally follow around the phrase 'Vecna'.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, really?","response":"DM: “I don't know too much other than what I've been told historically, and bits of information that I've picked up through the years. Vecna…” And he thinks for a second, he starts looking about if anyone else is near the table, you guys are off and throwing darts."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm listening in.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Pike, I don't know where you are, but I assume you're still–\nASHLEY: I'm listening. I'm listening.","response":"DM: Okay. “Vecna. He has many names historically. The Archlich. The Whispered One. The Dying King. The Lord of the Rotted Tower. The Undying King. Gods like titles, it seems. A bit arrogant, in my opinion. From what I heard, he was born a mortal. Used his capabilities to attempt to cheat death in every way possible, and then once that was acquired, naturally went on to the next great endeavor: becoming a god. He attempted to ascend six hundred years ago. But in that time his cult expanded across the rebuilding civilization. Nearly achieved it until it seemed that the remnants of good in society went and followed him to his place of worship and thwarted his ritual. He was slain, but as you've seen, when entities of such power get to a certain point, death is but a hurdle. You have enough  individuals that believe you're a god, that willpower is strong enough to keep you enduring. So his influence exists and has for many years. I don't know if he's a god per se, not yet, but there are those that treat him as such, and that in itself is dangerous because that means he's probably still out there. And I'm pretty sure he's very interested in finishing what he couldn't before.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What was he– Just trying to be a god, is it?","response":"DM: “That's all I've heard. Not a scholar of the religious rites, and for the most part a lot of his history's been, well, destroyed and kept secret. It's his bailiwick.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's his thing. Well.","response":"DM: “But anyway. If you've indeed come across any of this foul business, I recommend you stay far away. Far away! Bad news.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Bad news.","response":"DM: “Yes. Anyway, sorry, dour subject. Didn't mean to bring the mood down on that one.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't worry. It helped. Helped us.\nSAM: Well, it's been a fun night, guys, but I'm tired of letting Grog beat me at darts.\nTRAVIS: You really suck. I don't know if it's because you're so tiny–\nSAM: They put the dart board so high on the wall!\nTRAVIS: Yeah, but you put darts in two people's arms, I mean, are you really that–\nSAM: Well, one of those people was giving us the stink-eye.\nTRAVIS: That's true. He squealed out like a little girl, too.\nSAM: But we should go home.\nMARISHA: What?\nSAM: We should go home.\nMARISHA: Noooo.\nSAM: Keyleth, please, don't be this way. We'll go out again tomorrow. It'll be fine.\nMARISHA: You say that now, and then tomorrow some crazy person will show up at our door and want us to do something crazy and then we'll never have a free night again.\nSAM: I'm super old. Let's go.\nTRAVIS: You know what's really cool to do at the end of the night actually that will make you be there for the sun coming up, is if you do four shots of firewater in a row.\nMARISHA: What?\nTRAVIS: Yeah. It's a thing. It reinvigorates you, but you got to do them back to back to back to back.\nSAM: I do hear that cures the hangover.\nTALIESIN: I was going to encourage. No. I'm going to encourage this now. I think this is a great idea.\nTRAVIS: Listen, listen. Only because I'm identifying with your need for revelry, why don't you and I go do four shots back to back to back to back?\nMARISHA: Let's do it!","response":"DM: As you guys stand up and walk away, Gilmore looks to you and goes, “I like her much better this way.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Gilmore, I love you too!\nTRAVIS: Actually, you stay here. I'll bring it to the table. And I go and get the shots.","response":"DM: All of your drinks for the evening are paid for, Gilmore takes care of the tab."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my gosh, Gilmore!\nASHLEY: Gilmore!","response":"DM: You come back with the shots–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Oh wait, I want one, then!\nTRAVIS: Nine shots. Ten shots.\nMARISHA: She said two shots. She wants two shots.\nTRAVIS: Oh, two shots?\nMARISHA: She wants two shots, and so wait, are me and you doing the two and the–\nTRAVIS: That's ten shots.\nMARISHA: Quadruple?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, quad.\nLAURA: This is the stupidest thing ever.\nTRAVIS: What? She wants to see the sunrise. She'll totally be up for it.\nTALIESIN: Let it happen. We're all going to learn a valuable lesson.\nTRAVIS: Yeah. It's amazing. I come back with ten shots.\nLAURA: And she's getting two.\nTRAVIS: And two for Pike, so 11 shots.\nTALIESIN: Do we get a constitution bonus from the Heroes' Feast?","response":"DM: Not a constitution bonus."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I don't want it, anyway.\nTALIESIN: Oh, wow!\nMARISHA: Eight. Total.\nTRAVIS: 14.\nTALIESIN: 16.","response":"DM: Pike, what'd you get?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 18.\nTALIESIN: 20. I'm so sorry, 20.","response":"DM: Okay. So, Percy, you take your shot. It burns down. You're fine. Pike, bam, bam. The little gnome takes it in her gut, grins, wipes the edge of her chin, looks over to Grog with a bit of a challenge look on her face. Grog, you look over to Keyleth and both of you guys start slamming down the line. As you hit that fourth one, you can feel the burn on the inside. You, a little bit of that Heroes' Feast begins to creep up, and you get that acidic, you know–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Salsa?","response":"DM: Have to stop a little bit, take it back down, but you're good."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Little mild salsa?","response":"DM: But you're good. You kick it back. As soon as you open your eyes, you're like– You look over across the way and all you see is Keyleth, her expression go from a big smile, to neutral, to a worried frown, looking to the door."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She's going to– She's going to take hit points.\nMARISHA: I got to go outside. I got to go outside.\nLAURA: I got her. I got her.\nMARISHA: I got to– no, no, no, no.\nTRAVIS: No, she's got to stay!\nSAM: Vax! Vax! Hold her hair back! Hold her hair back.\nTRAVIS: We should pick her up and carry her around the bar.\nLAURA: Help her out.\nLIAM: I need to stay here.\nLAURA: I'll go help her out.\nTALIESIN: We've got her. We've got her.\nASHLEY: Wait. Okay, I want to help Keyleth out because she's– yeah. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Hold on. Go ahead.","response":"DM: Okay, so as you guys all–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Pike, tell me a story!","response":"DM: As you guys drag Keyleth outside– Scanlan? You're staying?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm not going near that shit.\nASHLEY: Yeah.\nSAM: You too, Gil.","response":"DM: “Well.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You aren't going, are you?","response":"DM: “It's getting very late. I've only been back a few days and I have a lot of business to attend to in the morning.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm sure you do. Could I borrow your ear for a few minutes?","response":"DM: “Certainly. It would be my absolute pleasure.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: You want some privacy?\nLIAM: In private.","response":"DM: “Oh. Far be me to stand in a way of a private conversation.” And he stands up for a second and walks over to the far table in the corner, right by the stage where the harpist was playing but is no longer on the stage. He sits down expectantly, waiting."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I watch this conversation from the doorway?","response":"DM: Well, if you guys are– the doorway leads into the textile portion, so if you guys aren't leaving the place entirely–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well, I figured we were just outside the door.\nTALIESIN: If you want to hang by the textile, I've taken her all the way out.\nLAURA: I'm just going to hang out and watch in.","response":"DM: Okay. Keyleth, make another constitution saving throw."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: This should be fun.\nMARISHA: No, that one cursed me before. That one was bad. Let's do this one. Oh, that's better. That's better. 18.","response":"DM: Okay, you do manage to make it all the way outside of the building before you Druidcraft all over–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, that looks terrible. That looks terrible! Don't do that. Don't do that! That looks really bad.\nLIAM: Giffed for eternity. It's the internet, you can't take it back. It's there forever.\nMARISHA: I'm so sorry.\nTALIESIN: It's okay.\nMARISHA: I'm so sorry.\nMARISHA: Grog said it would make me stay up.\nTALIESIN: It's okay. It's okay.","response":"DM: As you sit down. “Yes, Vax'ildan, darling?”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: We've known each other a long time.","response":"DM: “Yeah.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Long time, yeah? And I have a lot of love for you. You are an amazing man.","response":"DM: “Well. Not disagreeing with you there.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That is part of your charm. I don't even know what I'm saying. I feel I need to be honest with you. There's no question you and I have danced around each other a bit in the past few years, and I have been curious.","response":"DM: “Well. Curiosity is the spark of arcane pursuits and knowledge. Among many other things.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I've come close many times to going further than I have. You are a charming man. But I respect you very much. And I need to tell you that I can't do the dance anymore. I am in love with someone I don't think loves me, but all the same, it wouldn't be fair to you to think that we might dally, and I don't want to be a liar, so I won't be.","response":"DM: “Well, I certainly appreciate your honesty, and, well, I would be lying if I didn't say I was a little disappointed, but at the same time, the heart wants what the heart wants, and I've enjoyed our flirtation. Perhaps our paths aren't meant to be quite so entwined. Such is the flow of fate, my friend.” (sighs) And he gives a little sigh of digesting heartbreak a little bit, but, you know, there's a nod to him of understanding and acceptance, and he looks up to you again with that whipcrack of a Gilmore smile and says, “I wish you luck. The path of an uncertain heart is never an easy one, and should you ever need an ear to bend or a shoulder to cry on, well, you know where I am, and if I'm not there, you know how to get hold of me.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I reach out, hand behind his head, and I say, you are a beautiful arcane bastard, and I kiss him full on the lips.\nLAURA: Vax getting all the kisses.\nLIAM: I pat him on the shoulder. Thank you.","response":"DM: “Now you're just being a tease.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Good night, Gil.","response":"DM: Walks out into the night. As Gilmore walks by you guys, he looks over at Keyleth and goes, “Get her some water.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh, yes.\nMARISHA: Why does my mouth keep producing saliva?\nTRAVIS: Yeah, I'll get her water. I'll get her a little jug of the firewater. It'll wash out her mouth.\nASHLEY: Can I cast Lesser Restoration on her?","response":"DM: You can."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Cure alcohol poisoning?\nASHLEY: Just to give her still a little bit of a buzz. To just take the bad part out of it.","response":"DM: A proper use of divine magic!"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You can't divine the sad out of alcohol. I don't think that works.\nLIAM: Can Pike follow us around all the time everywhere for the rest of our days?","response":"DM: Pike is the best wingman."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Pike, Pike, I missed you so much.\nASHLEY: Come here, come here.\nMARISHA: I'm sorry, you guys. I'm so sorry.","response":"DM: Keyleth, as Pike embraces you, the warmth of her hug is also matched with the warmth of the divine energy that briefly flows through your body, and for a second you feel as if you're weightless, and the nausea is gone. The drunkenness is still there, and the buzz is still finding its way through your system, but not as heavy as it was before. You come a little more conscious of yourself, and when the warmth fades, you feel much more in control of your current state of your mind, your well-being, and the contents of your stomach."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Holy shit. What kind of shots did you give me, Grog?\nTRAVIS: The weak stuff. Yeah. I think they call it regret?\nSAM: Peach schnapps.\nLAURA: Goldschlager.\nTRAVIS: Goldschlager. Jaeger. Lemon citron vodka.\nMARISHA: (groans)\nASHLEY: Oh man, I love this game.\nLAURA: Should we go home?\nSAM: Let's go home. We've left our mark here.\nTRAVIS: Does Keyleth lose the benefits of the Heroes' Feast since she retched it all over the ground?\nLAURA: Oh my gosh.\nMARISHA: Why would you ask that question?\nTALIESIN: That's such a dick question to ask.\nMARISHA: My body absorbed the process and the calories.","response":"DM: It had been a few hours, or probably about an hour since the initial feasting, so she's had enough to maintain the effect. But the gentleman who owns the establishment is probably not going to be very happy in the morning when he has to clean up."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I made it outside.\nLAURA: Kick some dirt over her puke.\nLIAM: It's just twigs and berries, anyway.","response":"DM: You guys make your way back to Greyskull Keep. As you approach the front gate of your establishment, you see Cordell and Shayne keeping their evening watch over the gate. Cordell shouts down to the rest of you guys, “You've got guests waiting for you!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA and SAM: Oh, shit.\nLAURA: How long have they been here?","response":"DM: He looks to Shayne. Shayne looks to him, counts in her head. “I think probably at least two hours.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (splutters) How many times have we told you? Don't let guests in when we're not here!","response":"DM: “They had your permission.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, jeez. Who is it?","response":"DM: “Oh, it's a bunch of them.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, it's my friends! This is why I wanted to come home!\nLAURA: Oh, Jesus.\nMARISHA: The party keeps going! Cordell! Cordell, open another bottle!","response":"DM: He looks over at Shayne, who goes, “Don't do that, Cordell.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: God damn it, Cordell, we pay you!\nSAM: It's okay, ignore her. Let's go in.\nLAURA: At least they're having fun.","response":"DM: And as you walk towards the eating chambers, the central feasting area on the bottom floor of your keep, there indeed you see your recently discovered friends."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is that little– is it a halfling teenager that was picking pockets at the bar? Is he here?","response":"DM: He is, yes."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I walk up to him?","response":"DM: Yes. Samson right now, by the way, is asleep on a table. It's way past his bedtime. He's on the edge there."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I nudge him awake. Hey, Sticky Fingers.","response":"DM: “Hello, miss.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Hey. So I saw you at the bar, getting things off of people pockets. Off of people pockets?","response":"DM: “They told me they wouldn't miss them.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No, it's totally fine. I don't care. You haven't done that here, have you?","response":"DM: “No.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No.","response":"DM: “No, not unless he tells me to.” And points to Dr. Dranzel, who at this point has been like, “Scanlan! Finally.” (chuckles)"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Lovely to see you.","response":"DM: You can see now, there's three bottles of wine they've been drinking that are open and about."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Did you bring those?","response":"DM: “No! But they were provided, and I'm not one to not drink when it's not provided.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, thank you.\nMARISHA: Oh, good. Cordell! Cordell, I'm sorry. You opened wine, and I yelled at you. I'm sorry.","response":"DM: Cordell's at the front gate."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I figured Cordell walked us in.","response":"DM: No, they're up on the front gate. Keyleth is talking out to nothing."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thanks, Cordell! Thank you!","response":"DM: The Lesser Restoration didn't have quite as strong an effect on reversing the alcohol, but she's not puking, so that's good."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm still drunk.\nSAM: Doctor, thank you for coming over and bringing the gang. It's so great to see you again tonight.","response":"DM: “Oh, you guys as well.” You can see the rest of the people are watching. Zed's fallen asleep. Eselmyr's in the back corner, watching everyone."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is that the singer?\nSAM: Oh, please. Lay it on us. Anyone want to go to bed?\nMARISHA: No!","response":"DM: (chuckles) “I like her!”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yes, but let's do this anyway.\nLAURA: We already ate. We're fine. We're so full.\nALL: Yes.","response":"DM: “Sleep well. Glad you made it home safe.” She wanders back off, bags under her eyes. Dr. Dranzel waves you all in. “So, that little proposition that we talked about at the bar earlier today? The old man who didn't need his fortune?”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh.","response":"DM: “Allow me to elaborate a bit in a more private setting, if you don't mind.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: More private than our house?","response":"DM: “This is the more private.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Ah. Cin-cin, everybody. Cin-cin.\nSAM: Is that lipstick on your face, Vax?\nLIAM: Maybe it is. I don't know where it would have come from, though. This is a land of magic and mystery. Who knows?","response":"DM: As Dranzel holds out his mug, he goes, “Now, when we arrived to come play the Winter's Crest festival here in Emon, one of my contacts, we'll say an old client of mine last year in Emon, right around the same time mentioned a peculiar thing. Apparently, a wealthy lord here vanished about a year ago. His estate was sold to a private collector. Apparently, this collector keeps his name off the books, and he couldn't really find out any information about who he was or what his business is, but he acquired the entire estate. People were curious as to what his business was, as the previous individual was rather well known and the circumstances rather dubious in disappearance, but I don't know really how that all went together. Anyway! This older collector was fairly active at this estate until a few months ago. The windows have darkened and stayed as such. No furniture touched, the interior elements unpacked or moved. Just went away. So I'm thinking either this fellow has kicked the final bucket, met his end, or is off on some extended business trip, leaving his acquisition and all of its contents ripe for the picking. Problem is, we can't get into the Cloudtop District. Kent and Kaylie have tried numerous times. Almost got arrested.” And you can see, Kaylie gives a nod with her shoulders, shrugging. “Still got a few things to learn, apparently.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Did you try winking?","response":"DM: “It's the first thing I threw out there, dear.” He goes back. “So, seeing as how you folks have got some pull in the town, I was thinking you could either find a way to get us in quietly, carefully. Let us do our work, give us some tips on the best way to stay out of sight. Or you could go in, grab a few things, come back here with the spoils, and we'll take our cut.” His eyes look over to you. “I get the feeling that this kind of work is not unfamiliar.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: It's certainly things we've done in the past.\nSAM: Didn't we discuss this and assume that this is a house we'd been in once before?\nLAURA: Are we talking about General Krieg's house, or are we talking about the guy that we first came into his house in Emon, remember? The diplomat.\nTRAVIS: We don't know either way.\nSAM: Do you know who used to reside there, Doctor?","response":"DM: (sighs) “The name escapes me.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: What about a position?","response":"DM: You do recall, the Cloudtop District was not at your disposal when you first came here."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So this is a new place?\nLAURA: It's probably General Krieg's place.","response":"DM: Possibly."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Rage-looting.\nMARISHA: Yeah, we found the lair.\nTRAVIS: Down in the dungeon, there was the demon.\nLIAM: Teleportation device.\nLAURA: It could be a different house.\nTALIESIN: This was a while ago.\nLAURA: Does it sound like General Krieg's place? Did you get a description of the place?","response":"DM: “Yes. Red brick building, iron fence surrounding the outside–”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That's it.\nLAURA: That's like every house, though.","response":"DM: Actually, no. Most of the houses there have various colors. Krieg's was built more utilitarian and was very minimalistic in its interior decor. In fact, most of it seemed unused from what you saw, other than the manservant that lived there. The house, for the most part, the bedroom, everything that you searched, seemed like it was barely touched."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Because he was a dragon.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, he was a fucking dragon.\nLAURA: Was that his house, that he's describing?","response":"DM: It seems pretty damn close to the description that you recall."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: If we were to be interested, it's true that you are pointing us in the direction of this place, but we would be doing all the work. We would need a very high percentage.","response":"DM: “I'd previously discussed a 60-40 split.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I know that's what you said. I said high.","response":"DM: “70-30.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 80-20, or I'm not doing shit. You can send him in.\nSAM: Hey. This is my friend.","response":"DM: (sighs) “A tough bargain, but 80-20 it is.”"}
{"prompt":"MATT and LIAM: (spitting noises)\nLAURA: We haven't agreed to it.","response":"DM: “You just did!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We agreed to give you a cut if we go in.","response":"DM: “Fair enough.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Here's the thing. If you haven't noticed, we have a keep. An embassy. We're known around town. We're council members. We can't go stealing things from people's houses.","response":"DM: “Well, that's unfortunate. We'll have to find somebody else.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Well, hold on. He made a deal with you. If he doesn't do it, we'll find somebody that will. He's a man of his word, and we'll back it up. You don't have to do it.\nSAM: You know, Vex, we have sort of told the sovereign that we are interested keenly in the security of this area, and if this is an unsecured house, we could just be going in to try to secure it.\nTRAVIS: Excellent point.","response":"DM: “See? Thinking of the people. That's the Scanlan Shorthalt I know.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: And remember, there were dangerous things in that house. We can make sure that it's safe now, protecting the, you know–\nSAM: Yes. God forbid a child wanders in there.\nTRAVIS: God forbid.\nLIAM: We're not talking about breaking into a living man's home. Krieg is gone. Krieg was a dragon.\nLAURA: And then it was obtained by somebody else, who you don't know who it is.\nMARISHA: Oh, are we talking about General Krieg?\nLAURA: He was so dreamy. Do you remember him?\nMARISHA: He was so dreamy!","response":"DM: “Krieg. I've heard that name. I think that may be the gentleman.”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, you know Krieg?","response":"DM: “Well, I don't know him.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Perhaps we should at least take a look to see if there was something else down there that was dangerous.\nTRAVIS: She said fine! I heard her. She said fine.\nSAM: Let's do this. Tomorrow, we'll set off to do this. In the meantime, we invite you to stay at our keep. Drink of our wine, eat of our food.\nMARISHA: Yeah, more wine!\nSAM: Please, make yourselves at home.","response":"DM: “Is this not the greatest bard to have lived?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: (chuckles) Yes.\nTRAVIS: We think so.\nSAM: Thank you.","response":"DM: “Scanlan, you humble us all. We're happy to do so. And thank you very much for your fine hospitality.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: You humble us all by comparison.\nLAURA: We have one room, in addition to what we stay in. Would all of you be staying in the same one, or would you want to stay in the temple?\nSAM: We have a couple of rooms.\nLIAM: We have a dungeon.\nSAM: Our dragonborn room is available now, and as well, we have a dungeon.\nTRAVIS: I'll stay in the dungeon. They can stay in my room.\nSAM: I have a rather large bed, if Kaylie would like to take that. I could sleep on the floor. That's fine.\nLAURA: You invited them to stay because you want to bone Kaylie?\nTRAVIS: What, are you really cock-blocking right now?\nLIAM: Did you just say that out loud?\nTRAVIS: Are you cock-blocking in the keep?","response":"DM: As you're saying this, Kaylie is watching this with a smirk on her face. “Well, I'm not one to turn down a soft bed for an evening.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Yeah! Can't wreck that game!\nTALIESIN: We can also put some beds out in the workshop which has now been vacated.\nSAM: Grog, carry some beds around.\nMARISHA: How long are you guys staying?","response":"DM: Zed sits up, the large, bearded gentleman. He's like, “I'm happy to sleep here. This is fine by me. Just give me a flat surface.” He goes over to one of the tables and–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Is that Zed the drummer?","response":"DM: Yeah, he's the drummer."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay.\nTRAVIS: Why don't you invite the little pickpocket to sleep with you? So you can keep an eye on him. So he doesn't steal stuff. Where are you going, perv?\nLAURA: Where are you going, perv?\nSAM: Let's all turn in, shall we?\nTRAVIS: Let's turn in!\nLAURA: I'm going to stay up and keep an eye on the doors when they go into their rooms and make sure they actually stay– actually, no, I'm going to go find Jareth.","response":"DM: Jarett, you mean?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Jarett.","response":"DM: It's been that week."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Aw.\nTALIESIN: I shove Keyleth into her room.\nMARISHA: (slurred) Good night, Percy.\nTALIESIN: Good night.","response":"DM: You guys all find your way to your rooms. You arrange beds for those who need it, for the most part down in the dungeon area. A couple of rooms are crowded with other folks, except for Kaylie, who is following you, Scanlan, with a bottle of wine and two glasses."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh my.\nLIAM: Oh dear.\nLAURA: She's going to rob you blind.","response":"DM: As you all go to your various rooms, Kaylie pulls out the chair and the table at the far end of your bedroom. Sets down and begins to pour glasses of wine and sits across. You guys have drinks and begin various conversations about–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I tell her all the best parts, and leave out the naughty bits.","response":"DM: “Interesting tale.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Kingslayer.","response":"DM: “Right, right.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Leader of the rebellion.","response":"DM: “So you've said, a number of times, aye.”"}
{"prompt":"She drinks a little bit more of the wine, sets it down. “I guess I should tell you a bit more about myself, then.”\nSAM: Yes, please, I'm fascinated.","response":"DM: “Well, I grew up in Kymal, mostly, before moving to Westrunn to train at the College of the White Duke. Finest of the bards, he was.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes, yes he–","response":"DM: “My mom gave all her savings to put me up there. Now, I only joined the troop about six months back. It was my third year at the Duke's when the good doctor came through and, well, I seized the opportunity. Now, to be perfectly honest up-front, I've already heard a bit about your tales, Shorthalt. (chuckles) The  Charming of the Pauper Prince, your rendition of the Summer Sunder, the Cliffs of Dagger Bay. I've been hoping our paths would cross.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You're not there, Drunky.\nLAURA: You're drunk, go to sleep.\nMARISHA: (wheezing) Cliffs of Dagger Bay! Go ahead!","response":"DM: Dagger Bay's just a place."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Yeah?\nMARISHA: Go ahead.\nSAM: Well, I'm flattered, and, you have quite talent for– quite a lot of talent for just been playing with the troop for six months. I was impressed by that.","response":"DM: “Thank you very much. You know where I've heard most of these stories? My mother, Sybil.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Who?","response":"DM: “Sybil. A fine gnomish lass, it was some years ago, she came across a smooth, silver-tongued flautist who blew through like the wind and disappeared.”"}
{"prompt":"(gasping)\nSAM: I– oh, I–","response":"DM: “I practiced. I stole. Lied about my age and eventually paid my way into the Duke's College so I could find you. Prove you a scoundrel.” At this point, you see her stand up, and she begins to draw a small blade from her side."}
{"prompt":"SAM: She's going to fight me!\nMARISHA: Oh my god!","response":"DM: Her face is hardened and still as she stares at you. You see a slight tremble in her hand. “This day, Scanlan Shorthalt, I beat you at your own song. Now I come to take your dignity. Now take up your sword.”"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: (whispering) Holy shit–\nSAM: First of all, Kaylie, it's so wonderful to meet you.","response":"DM: “Don't try that with me.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I didn't know! Listen, I have my faults, for sure, but (stammers) I didn't know that you existed! I would have, I would have come to visit, I would have come to meet you– how can you fault me for something that I did not know about?","response":"DM: “Do you even remember Sybil?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I mean, could you describe her a little more detailed?","response":"DM: Make a wisdom check. Roll a d20, add your wisdom modifier."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay, wisdom? Which is a negative two. 16.","response":"DM: 16. You vaguely recall Sybil. She– golden hair, very eager to escape her simple beginnings, and very clingy very quickly. You jumped out of there very fast, from your perspective."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Ah yes, Sybil. She was passionate, intelligent–\nSAM: She really, lot of– hands-y, sort of, I mean, I think I remember her quite well. And she was a wonderful person, and you should be honored to have such a wonderful person as your parent, and not someone like me, because I was a scoundrel, you're right.","response":"DM: “You are a scoundrel.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I have been, in past moments in my life, a scoundrel, I've–","response":"DM: “Do you even realize you nearly invited your daughter up to sleep with you?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I mean…","response":"DM: “You don't care.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I feel like I wouldn't have let it go that far? I–","response":"DM: “You have no boundaries. You take what you like and you keep walking on. You trick folk. Now draw your blade.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't want to fight you, if that's what you're insinuating. Listen, I know that I've made mistakes in my life. I've admitted as much before, and I don't know why I'm this way. I must need to do a lot of soul-searching to come up with an answer, but there is a woman who I love very dearly and who I would do anything for, and I'm trying to be a better person. I haven't been to a whorehouse in months! That's a big step for me. A bit step. I know that sounds callous and crude, but I've tried to be a better person. If you're here to fight me, I'm afraid you're going to be terribly disappointed, because I will just let you kill me, if that's what it takes. I didn't know you existed, and my heart is breaking a hundred times now for not knowing it. Every year that you've been alive is a year I could have been a better person and known someone who could have made me a better person, and I'm only sorry that I didn't know it. If there's anything I can do for you from now on– if you are truly my blood, I will, because among my many faults, ego is certainly one of them, and knowing you're part of me makes me love you even more.","response":"DM: Make a persuasion check. With advantage, for that speech."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Persuasion?\nLIAM: With advantage!\nSAM: It won't matter.\nMARISHA: Is there a manipulation check?\nSAM: 32.\nTRAVIS: No shit, it won't matter.\nLAURA: Oh? She rolled high, too.\nSAM: Oh, shit. She's big.\nMARISHA: A bard.","response":"DM: As she stands there with her blade out, staring at you, you can see the veins in her neck tensing."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I slowly unbutton my shirt and show her my chest and say, “Stab me right here, if you'd like, and I will not resist. You've earned it. Take me.”","response":"DM: You see the tear begin to roll down her cheek as her jaw clenches. (grunts) And she thrusts forward–  and rolls a natural one."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A natural one?\nLAURA: Aw, a natural one.","response":"DM: As she goes to strike towards you, even in that moment, her will falters and the blade falls limp. It hits your chest, and you feel the piercing of something pushing into your flesh, but no more than maybe half an inch, as there's no real force behind the blade. As the hand releases her weapon, it clatters to the ground as her momentum carries her arms around your shoulders."}
{"prompt":"ALL: Oh!","response":"DM: As she holds you there, her tousled, short pixie brown hair, you can feel the wetness across the back of your neck, and you hear her voice trembling in your ear say, “Why? Why can't I do it? All the years building up to this and I have the chance, and I can't do it.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry that you're going through this, and I'm more sorry that you're going through this by yourself, but I think deep down you're a Shorthalt, and there's something that you have that's connected to me and I to you, and perhaps I misread that as some sort of– ugh– icky attraction, and I apologize, but I've known for a while now that something is missing in my life, some sort of focus, and some sort of moral compass. Maybe it's just arrived at my doorstep?","response":"DM: You say that and her arms tense for a minute, involuntary, trying to pull you closer, then they relax, and she steps away, averting her gaze, keeping her head down. She bends down and picks up her blade. Doesn't sheathe it, just holds it limply at her side. She begins to walk to the door. She opens the door and looks back at you, her eyes finally meeting yours. You can see the wet stains across her cheeks. “You're still a scoundrel. It's what's kept you alive this long. In some ways, it's what's kept me alive this long. I've got a lot to think about. I'm going to go for a walk. (sighs) I need some fresh air.” And she closes the door behind her."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I sit for a moment and think about everything, try to remember more about Sybil.","response":"DM: There's a lot of faces blurring, this is– You worked your way through a lot of Tal'Dorei in those days, you–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes. She was, she was. Yes, I think, yeah. She wasn't that giant. No, she was. Okay. And I have a very restless night thinking about everything.","response":"DM: Okay. And with that, we're going to go ahead and take a bathroom break. We'll be back here in five minutes."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Amazing, amazing!\nMARISHA: So good! You.","response":"DM: You avoided a showdown in your bedroom."}
{"prompt":"SAM: With my daughter!","response":"DM: She was ready to. We'll be back here real fast, take this, a quick break, quick as we can, because we have a lot to get through before we get to Critmas. We'll see you here in just a few minutes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Damn!\nLAURA: That was awesome.\nTRAVIS: Balls.\nLAURA: I had, in the night I had gone to find Jarett.","response":"DM: Oh right, Jarett, sorry."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Just to tell him to keep an eye on the rooms and everything. Because, you know, I'm sure they're all great people, but– I know they have some shady practices, so. I just want to make sure that–\nSAM: That's my daughter you're talking about, by the way.\nTRAVIS: We don't know that yet.\nSAM: Mm. Is Dr. Dranzel around?","response":"DM: Yeah. As you head down to the main dining area, Dranzel is there and he's a little hungover himself and enjoying the remnants of his meal. Poor Laina is not designed to produce breakfast for over 11 people in a morning."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Old friend, a quick word.","response":"DM: “Yes. Good morning, Scanlan.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Good morning– Well, morning to you as well. Did you know?","response":"DM: “About?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Did you know? About the girl?","response":"DM: “What did she do?”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Does he seem– Can I insight check him?","response":"DM: Yeah, make an insight check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Does he seem genuine? Oh, boy.\nSAM: Three.","response":"DM: Three. Seems pretty genuine. Yeah, he's hard to read beyond hung over and mildly confused. And you spent a lot of time with him, so you know his demeanor pretty well. But yeah, he seems genuinely like (stutters) “If she's done anything wrong, let me know. She's part of my troupe. I take responsibility for her.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Can I check around? Look around the keep and make sure– I mean in the general area and see if anything's missing?\nTRAVIS: So paranoid.\nLAURA: Seriously, I do not trust these people.\nSAM: Where's our five-thou?\nLAURA: Yeah, where is our five-thou? Did it get delivered?","response":"DM: It never got delivered."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Oh shit.","response":"DM: I mean, who are you asking?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm asking the guards at the front if anybody came from the keep, from Uriel.","response":"DM: Okay. Cordell and Shayne are now changing over into the next morning staff. As they're getting their stuff together, the morning staff would be Kendrick–"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Natibe?","response":"DM: – and Natibe, yes. You took notes."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I wrote them down, it's not a big deal.\nLIAM: You pulled a rabbit out of a hat.","response":"DM: But yeah, as they're changing over, you walk over and ask them. And Shayne goes, “Yeah, no, we had a messenger come by and drop something off for you guys.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where is it?","response":"DM: “Well, we gave it to Erwen and he brought it inside, but you guys weren't home.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What did it look like?","response":"DM: “A small wooden thing, right?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where did Erwen put it?","response":"DM: Cordell's like, “Yeah, it was like a small wooden case.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where did you put it? Where did you put it?","response":"DM: “Erwen took it in.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Where's Erwen?","response":"DM: They both look at each other. “Look, our shift's over.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Just tell me where the fuck Erwen is.","response":"DM: “Probably inside the keep! I don't watch your little old man-servant. I'm sorry. I'm supposed to watch the front of the gate.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Fuck. I go inside to find Erwen.","response":"DM: Okay. Erwen, who's dressed up in his proper servant attire now that he has to entertain guests. His hair is slicked back and is a scoop of a balding male dome. “Yes, Vex'ahlia. May I be of service to you this morning?”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You look wonderful today.","response":"DM: “Oh, you.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Box, box, box, where did it go, box? The box that came last night.","response":"DM: “Oh! Oh yes! No, there was a delivery.”"}

{"prompt":"LAURA: Our guests did?\nLAURA: Our guests did? I go storming into the breakfast area. Dr. Dre!\nSAM: Dra.\nLAURA: Dr. Dra. Hey!","response":"DM: He's stood up and put his hat on. “Ah, yes!”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Yes. You had the best night's sleep here, I bet? So comfortable? Lots of wine? That box, give it to me now.\nLAURA: That's so kind of you.","response":"DM: “We're more than happy to help. You being such fine hosts to us, it's the least we could do.” And he leans over to Kent. (murmurs something) You can read lips."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I can read lips. What did he say?","response":"DM: As he leans over, he says, “Kent, you better go get the box.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay.","response":"DM: “Right, okay.” Steps away, runs up to the guest room that they were staying, comes back down carrying the small chest."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Thank you so much! I open it up and count it.\nLAURA: In case we got robbed.","response":"DM: “Right, you wouldn't lose everything.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: That's so kind of you.","response":"DM: “Thinking ahead.”"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: What nice friends you have, Scanlan.\nSAM: Well, you know.\nLAURA: They're so giving.\nSAM: They're cool.\nTRAVIS: How was last night, huh?\nSAM: Ugh.\nTRAVIS: Pretty wild? Thank god the walls are made of stone!\nMARISHA: Have we all come downstairs or are we all sitting around–","response":"DM: You've all, eventually, come downstairs."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: You? Struck out?\nSAM: Yeah, it's fine.\nTRAVIS: Maybe I should have a go at her, then.\nSAM: No! No, no, no! She doesn't like our kind, she's–\nTALIESIN: What is 'our kind' supposed to mean?\nSAM: She's off-limits. I saw her first.\nTRAVIS: Wait, wait, wait. Are you in love?\nSAM: Yes, you could say so.\nTRAVIS: Holy shit.\nTALIESIN: Did you hear that, Pike?\nMARISHA: No, I don't think she did.\nASHLEY: Did I hear what?\nLIAM: Scanlan said he's in love.\nLAURA: With someone else.","response":"DM: He said he's in love."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I insight check him? Because it was awfully quiet in your room, Scanlan.\nASHLEY: Normally so loud.\nInsight check. 18.","response":"DM: Were you being honest?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I think maybe.","response":"DM: Yeah. No, Scanlan seemed pretty honest, if guarded."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. Okay.","response":"DM: At this point, Dr. Dranzel is like, \"Speaking of which, where is Kaylie? I haven't seen her all morning.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I don't know. She ran off last night. But we should find her.\nMARISHA: You scared another one away?\nSAM: You could say that.\nMARISHA: Oh, Scanlan. I kind of liked her.\nSAM: Your breath is disgusting.\nSAM: Disgusting. Get a root, do something with it. It's disgusting.\nMARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Actually, what happened?\nSAM: That's fine. Ask Pike.\nMARISHA: Pike, what happened?\nASHLEY: Oh, it's fine! We had so much fun and did shots of fire-something.\nTRAVIS: Water. Fire water.\nASHLEY: Grog's idea.\nMARISHA: Grog.\nTRAVIS: What?\nTALIESIN: You had a very good time.\nTRAVIS: You were very passionate. You were like, “I need fire water,” I said, “okay.”\nMARISHA: That sounds like something I'd do.\nTALIESIN: And then we planned to investigate a house and possibly pilfer.","response":"DM: “Yes, yes!”"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Wait, we did what?\nSAM: Yes, we're going to go do that today.\nTALIESIN: We're going to investigate a house.\nMARISHA: No, what was the second word you said?\nTALIESIN: Possibly.\nMARISHA: The third word you said?\nTALIESIN: Pilfer.\nMARISHA: That one.\nTALIESIN: Yes.\nMARISHA: Well, what, what?\nSAM: It's a bad guy's house, so it'll be fine.\nMARISHA: Whose house?\nTRAVIS: So you remember when we went to General Krieg's house?\nSAM: We'll explain on the way.\nMARISHA: Wait!\nLAURA: Don't worry about it, Keyleth, we'll talk about it on the way.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, it's all good. We're making sure the city is safe from the house. It's empty. We're going to make sure it stays empty and safe.\nTALIESIN: Last time we were there, things attacked us, so we're going to double-check.\nMARISHA: Yeah, the dragon that we provoked. So, you know.\nTALIESIN: Mysterious things have been happening, though.\nMARISHA: What do you all want in the house?\nTALIESIN: Nothing.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nMARISHA: What do you all want in the house?\nSAM: We don't know. We don't know what's in the house. It's a mysterious thing to be happening in this town.","response":"DM: “Yeah, just an investigation.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: We're going to check it out. We won't do anything untoward.\nMARISHA: This sounds like nothing we would ever agree to. Ever. We would never agree to investigate a house with nothing.\nTRAVIS: Well, somebody said that they were afraid that bad things were coming out of it.\nMARISHA: So we're now going to go into a house with bad things coming out of it. And we don't know what these bad things are. What did we agree to, Percy? Percy, what did we agree to?\nTALIESIN: We–\nMARISHA: Percy, tell me.\nTALIESIN: We agreed to take a look inside this house and if there was anything valuable we would liberate it.","response":"DM: “And while you guys do that, we'll wait here and eagerly keep an eye out for Kaylie and–”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Yes, please do. And keep a good eye out for her.","response":"DM: “Sure.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: And if you have a gig tonight– Do you have a gig tonight anywhere?","response":"DM: “Not this evening, no.”"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Well, you would dream of it. You'd absolutely dream of it. Just don't do it.","response":"DM: Tips his hat a little. “Understood.”"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Maybe we could pay Jarett a little overtime.\nLAURA: I fully, fully intend–","response":"DM: And as you turn and look over at the door, Jarett's there with his crossbow, still over on the side, looking in. He glances over."}

Well.\nSAM: She is the worst drunk.\nTRAVIS: And we leave.\nMARISHA: I didn't even get to see the sunrise.\nLAURA: Aww.\nTALIESIN: I'll make sure you see a sunrise. Now come on. We need you with us anyway.\nMARISHA: No!\nTALIESIN: To keep us honest.\nMARISHA: Percy. Pike!\nASHLEY: Well, I think we should just go.\nTRAVIS: Yes!\nASHLEY: You know, how about we just go? You could wait outside just in case something happens.\nMARISHA: Vex.\nLAURA: I don't want to steal anything either.\nTALIESIN: We should take a look.","response":"DM: At this point, Zedd, the rather rotund drummer, has finished eating his breakfast. He's got bits of egg in his beard. He spins around and goes, “You're more than welcome to stay here with us.”"}

{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Who else is coming?\nSAM: I'm coming.\nLAURA: Trinket follows before I do.\nTALIESIN: Trinket's coming.\nMARISHA: Trinket is a bear.\nTALIESIN: Yes. A wise bear.\nLAURA: Keyleth, seriously, I don't want to steal anything. I want to find out why these– They can't hear me, I'm whispering to her.\nTALIESIN: I think we're already on our way, aren't we?\nLAURA: We're walking. I want to find out why they want to get into the house. That's all. Something shady's going on.\nLIAM: The last time we were there, something looked at us through things on the wall. Right? So it knew where we were and we fled. We have no idea what we left behind. We left in a hurry.\nTALIESIN: And the new owner has also left in a hurry.\nMARISHA: Okay. Let's go.\nLAURA: We're keeping things safe.\nTRAVIS: No, we should stay, we shouldn't go to the house– Yeah, let's fucking go!\nMARISHA: We're keeping things safe. Vox Machina. Woo, let's go.\nTALIESIN: It's tough being the good one.\nLAURA: I don't like them at our keep.\nSAM: We're taking the bear or leaving the bear?\nLAURA: We're fucking taking the fucking bear!\nSAM: Just a simple question.\nLAURA: That's my whole fighting fucking thing is I have a fucking bear. That's the whole point of the class that I took. I keep the bear.\nLIAM: What kind of classes? Have you been going to night school?\nLAURA: Yeah, classes. You know, writing, creative writing.\nLIAM: Emon Community College.\nLAURA: Yeah. I'm learning things, every day.\nLIAM: Everyone says words. I don't know what all these words mean. What's a douchebag?\nTRAVIS: We can remember how to get back to that house, right?","response":"DM: Yeah."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Just skate over that one.","response":"DM: You guys make your way towards the Cloudtop District. You're allowed through the gates and you find your way across the central residential area to the far northeast side of the district. This is further away from the palace, within viewing distance from Allura's tower, which still stands over the entirety of the district, like this looming monolith. Currently empty and cold as she's over in Whitestone for this investigation. However, you do come across the familiar site of General Krieg's homestead, the one you infiltrated a little over a year ago. It looks like it's a little dilapidated, but strangely enough, for a person who's purchased this estate, there wasn't much attempt to try and beautify it. The ivy has overgrown the bottom of it. There is still the iron gate around it. It is currently closed and there are no guards posted around it. It looks empty and vacant and dark in the windows. It's about noon."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Have a look around?\nLAURA: Yeah. Go around the back.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys scoot around to the back side. Anything in particular you're looking for?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Any signs of life?\nLIAM: Anyone around? Watching?","response":"DM: Perception check. For those who wish to look around."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 23 for me.\nLAURA: One.\nTRAVIS: Five.\nTALIESIN: 16.\nLIAM: What about around the house? Outside the house?","response":"DM: Outside the house? The grass, the lawn that surrounds this–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Or surrounding buildings.","response":"DM: Surrounding buildings. There a number of other homes as well, but this area is the more upper class, upper crust aspect of Emon. A number of various manors and rather decadent buildings. Each building has its own color scheme, its own architecture. Each thing is trying to be distinct and different in this microcosm of the societal space of Emon, where most of the gold passes through. They have their own worries about presentation. Which is interesting, because in the middle of all these very beautiful homes, you have General Krieg's home, which is pretty basic, red brick, utilitarian and sticks out like a sore thumb by comparison. Or doesn't stick out at all by comparison, because it's so normal-looking."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I like it.\nLAURA: Can I ask you guys, before we do anything, maybe it would be best to tell the guards that we're investigating a disappearance? We've heard things about the house and we need to check inside.\nSAM: What guards?\nMARISHA: I agree.\nLAURA: It's obviously shady if we go sneaking in, but if we say, “We're going in the house, because we worry for it,” then it's okay.\nTRAVIS: Should we tell them when we go to the bathroom, too?\nLAURA: Maybe, Grog.\nSAM: We're above them in rank.\nTRAVIS: Yeah.\nMARISHA: But the guards have the ability to call higher authority on us and we don't want people–\nTALIESIN: Are there any guards that we can see right now?","response":"DM: Glancing about, there are none in your immediate vicinity. You're not that far from the Citrine Garrison, which is the centerpiece of the higher military folk. And they do have their own guard station about. You're about a ten-minute walk from the palace, which has a number of guards throughout, and you do have some patrols that come through the city. But in the middle of the day in the Cloudtop, it's not as pressing a place for guard presence. So you haven't seen any immediately around you. But I'm sure if you wait for the next 15-20 minutes, one will probably come your way."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I mean, they probably have a key to General Krieg's place. We can just barge on in.\nSAM: Well, it's owned by someone, isn't it? Someone deserted it.\nLAURA: Did somebody buy it after him?\nSAM: Yes, it's private property.\nLAURA: Oh.\nSAM: You're being very prudent.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, we'll totally wait here while you go tell the guards that we want to go inspect something.\nSAM: We're better at this than them. Let's go do what we do. Right, Trinket?","response":"DM: (bear noises) As he growls into your ear."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: No.\nSAM: How can you resist that?\nTALIESIN: If we come across a guard, I'd be happy to inform them of what we're doing.\nMARISHA: Why don't we at least do a little bit of pre-planning? Do we need like a warrant for something like this?\nTRAVIS: Oh, fuck that. I walk up to the door and knock really loud.\nLAURA: There's a gate around the outside.","response":"DM: There is a gate."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I thought we were around the back.","response":"DM: You guys were around back. There's the gate, which is about– the fence itself is about seven feet tall with little metal impaler spikes on the top."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I'll hop over that.\nSAM: Hop check.\nTRAVIS: 15.","response":"DM: Okay! Okay. You deftly avoid falling upon one and spearing your manhood, thankfully. As you grab the edge, (grunts) loftily heft yourself over the top of the gate, landing within the other side of the browning yard that hasn't been well-kept."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Hmm. You might want to tell the guard I'm walking on the yard. Let them know I'm going. And I go off towards the house.","response":"DM: Grog walks away from you guys towards the house brazenly in the middle of the midday sun."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Grog, that rhymed! Well done!\nLAURA: Anybody want a peanut?\nMARISHA: I stand next to Vex, irritated.\nLIAM: And during that whole exchange, I've been changing cloaks and putting on the red one. Great.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Subtle. So stealthy now.\nLIAM: I don't need to be subtle, I'm just standing around, you guys are arguing, he's making a fool of you, I'm just changing my cloak. I have 17 cloaks.\nSAM: Do you bring around one of those like–\nMARISHA: Wardrobe racks?\nSAM: Yeah, rolling wardrobe racks\nLIAM: Yeah. It's on wheels, it's on wheels. It's functional.\nTRAVIS: It bobbles on the cobblestones.","response":"DM: You're going, “Shh! Follow me.” (squeaking sound)"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: So you have a very wrinkly red cloak on right now.\nLIAM: You know what? Never mind! I think, what I think is that Grog and Pike should lead the way, stealth in, pick all the locks, and I think everything will go really well.\nTRAVIS: That's a great idea.\nLIAM: I'm going to hang back. I think that's the way to go.","response":"DM: Grog, you're already at the front door."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Brilliant. Boom, boom, boom.\nSAM: Grog just knocked.","response":"DM: You guys hear in the distance (knocking) as Grog's fist is now hitting–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Walking to the front gate.\nMARISHA: You know, I could Skywrite that we're here in the sky again.","response":"DM: Nobody answers the door."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: There's no answer at the door!\nASHLEY: Can I try picking the lock?","response":"DM: Do you have lockpicks?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: She's going to literally try picking the lock? Yes!\nASHLEY: Do I have a lockpick?\nLIAM: I take Pike by the hand and go: here you go, chum, and I slap down my set in her hand.","response":"DM: Vex appears seemingly out of nowhere and slaps his lockpicks–"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: I'm Vax.","response":"DM: I'm sorry, Vax. So, Pike. I've gotten much better at that."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It happens to everybody.","response":"DM: Pike, you want to try and pick the lock?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah.\nSAM: I'm going to inspire her.","response":"DM: Okay, go for it."}
{"prompt":"SAM: With a limerick.\nLIAM: There's no way this is not good.\nALL: Aw!","response":"DM: That is a real easy d10 inspiration die for you, Pike."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's a panty-dropper, as Sam would say.","response":"DM: So go ahead and roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.","response":"DM: Which is what?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So in addition to the 20?","response":"DM: Yeah, well, what'd you roll?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I rolled a six.","response":"DM: Okay. Then what's your dexterity modifier?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: One.","response":"DM: That's a seven. Now go ahead and roll a d10 and add that to it."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. I rolled a nine.\nALL: Oh!\nSAM: That helps.\nASHLEY: Wait! 16! 16!","response":"DM: Even better!"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Everybody, meet your new rogue.","response":"DM: Yes. With the rattle of metal plate, the untrained eye, and a couple times you hear the metal (creaking) beginning to bend as she, having no previous experience really with lockpicks from what you know, you're afraid she's going to break your toolset. However, she's picked up a few things while she was at sea with, you know, more of the swashbuckling brigades over the western shores, and much to your surprise, she (click, opening sound). The door opens and the dark interior of the home is at your disposal."}
{"prompt":"SAM: See, this is our problem. We've been approaching doors without Pike! We need Pike!\nTRAVIS: I reach down and high-five Pike.\nLIAM: She pushes massive statues, she unlocks all doors.\nTRAVIS: I stick my head in the door and I go: hello? Is anyone home?\nASHLEY: I give his pick back to him. And I say: it was just luck, Vax.\nLIAM: Shut up, baby. I know it.\nTRAVIS: I lean back and I go: there's nobody answering from inside. Vex, you might want to go tell the guard no one's inside.\nLAURA: Asshole. I feel like we have a blessing of Sarenrae though to go inside.","response":"DM: As you step into the home a little bit, the first thing you notice is the smell. Immediate, pungent scent of decay hits your nose. The source is not in immediate visual range and you can't really tell what type of decay it is, but it's a definitively terrible smell, and one that permeates the interior of the foyer. Foyer."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: It smells like roses inside.\nTALIESIN: I'm coming in.\nTALIESIN: The trap room, the little portal in it.","response":"DM: Yep. The false wall in the back."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh right. Behind the tapestry, right?\nTALIESIN: Let's find the source of the smell.\nLAURA: Trinket is actually really good at sniffing things out, so maybe he can lead us to the smell.\nASHLEY: Good boy.","response":"DM: Trinket comes sniffing up. (sniffing sounds) Go ahead and make a perception check for Trinket."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay. It's too much, it's advantage because of his smell.","response":"DM: True."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Wow, those sucked both times.\nLAURA: Shut up. Shit, they do. 16?\nSAM: Oh, that's good!\nLIAM: Enough to open a door.","response":"DM: Okay, so Trinket sniffs through, steps into the center of the foyer, pushes past the carpet into the middle of the dining room, and looks up at the table and as soon as you look over, Trinket growls for a moment and you see there on the center of the dining room table is a meal set up. Drink, food, but is completely molded over to the point where parts of it have bloated and spilled off and liquid has– the putrescence has spread across part of the surface."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oof, I throw the gas mask on.","response":"DM: It's been there for quite some time, you don't know quite how long."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Free food, Grog.\nTRAVIS: I know, it smells pretty good in here.\nLAURA: Is there dust on the ground? Has it been that long?","response":"DM: Yeah, you check down, you put your finger across it, and it is a little dusty. It's not been an extremely long period of time but there is a layer of dust."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is there anything changing the dust? Is there any tracks in it or anything?","response":"DM: Currently from what you can see, no."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Have we all entered?","response":"DM: You've all begun to walk into the foyer, yes."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Let's search the upstairs first, see if there's a body or otherwise.\nMARISHA: Oh god, this isn't helping with the hangover.\nLIAM: Does the smell get more intense at the food?","response":"DM: Yes, the smell gets more intense as you enter the dining room."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh, so it's the food.\nLIAM: I almost can't smell you.\nMARISHA: Can I Druidcraft the table and take like the decaying food and maybe, I don't know, grow some flowers out of it, try to make it look nice?\nTALIESIN: Compost it?\nMARISHA: Try and compost it, yeah?","response":"DM: Sure. You take a moment and concentrate and use your Druidcraft. The fungus begins to reform and more mushroom-like spores begin to appear out of it and sprout from the current festering mass. Whereas once was a nasty spore cloud-based fungus, you've now converted almost into a colored mushroom-type presentation"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Don't eat it, Grog.\nTRAVIS: What?","response":"DM: It'll probably lessen the stench over time, but no immediate effect as the smell has been hanging here stagnant for quite a while."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: It's like a big old terrarium now\nTRAVIS: So it's a big old house. Can we like split up and get it over with?\nSAM: Split the party.\nMARISHA: Split the party!\nTALIESIN: We've all got earrings, let's start checking rooms and we'll get to the room that we know is iffy last.\nSAM: Okay. So wait, we're checking all the rooms that are probably okay?\nTALIESIN: Yes. I'm going to start upstairs, check the bedrooms.\nLIAM: You mean the not okay part being the teleportation room?\nSAM and TALIESIN: Yes.","response":"DM: What's up, Pike?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I cast Spirit Guardians to be around us?","response":"DM: You can. What is the duration on that one?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Ten minutes.","response":"DM: Yeah, you can do that."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Nice.","response":"DM: So, as you guys are walking in, Pike clasps her holy symbol and closes her eyes for a second and you begin to see these almost glowing orbs, like these ghostly entities that begin to swirl and follow around you. Similar in the spirit stuff of Pike's form when she was alongside you guys in Whitestone. Who's heading upstairs?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'll go upstairs with Percy.\nTALIESIN: Sure.\nTRAVIS: Anybody else?\nLAURA: Sure, I'll go upstairs, too.\nMARISHA: Is there a downstairs? Like a cellar?","response":"DM: The downstairs would be the path that you found last time."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And that's it?","response":"DM: You didn't inspect the rest of the house at that point."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: There's lots of downstairs rooms.\nTALIESIN: We should remind everyone you are immune to poison, you are immune to cursed, you've got a bonus on wisdom saving throws, and plus 1d10 temporary hitpoints.\nMARISHA: That's from the Heroes' Feast?\nSAM: Poison, charm– what was it?\nTALIESIN: Curse.\nMARISHA: Let me remember them all.\nMARISHA: I'll stay on the middle floor. I'll be team middle floor.","response":"DM: Okay. As Vex, Scanlan, and Percy head towards the stairway, they step across the red carpet in the center of the foyer– I need all three of you to make a dexterity saving throw."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, I didn't say perception, shit balls.\nSAM: Dexterity, huh?","response":"DM: Correct."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Natural 20!","response":"DM: Nice."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: 24.\nSAM: 12.\n(crackling).\nLIAM: They didn't make it out of the room, right? This is in the room that we're all in?\nMARISHA: So we're all still there, we can see him?","response":"DM: Yeah, you all see Scanlan currently now trapped in this force cage."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Full on Ghostbuster-ing. Don't mime, don't mime.\nSAM: Well.\nMARISHA: Hang on, hang on. Let's just leave him for a minute. Let's just leave him. Can we leave him? I can fix this. I could fix it, (whispers) but why don't we leave him?","response":"DM: Scanlan, roll another dexterity check"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Oh shit, it's closing on me, isn't it? Natural 20.","response":"DM: Okay. You can see the cage itself, its unstable energy occasionally arcs across like a Tesla coil and you manage to dodge out of the way and you can see now this cage not just holds you in place, but it also perpetually tries to damage those who are captured."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh, I feel a little bad. I'll let him out. Dispel Magic.\nSAM: Oh! You've got that!\nMARISHA: I did today.","response":"DM: As Keyleth waves her hand now the entire force cage vanishes into the air."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Did you guys see that? I was like in an aquarium.\nMARISHA: It was kind of fun to watch, I'm not going to lie.\nTRAVIS: Yeah, you were like a dick in a box.\nSAM: More of a globe, but yeah, no, that works.\nASHLEY: Oh wow.\nLIAM: Wow.\nTALIESIN: Gently checking for traps as we go up the stairs.\nSAM: Thank you Keyleth, I take it back about your breath.","response":"DM: I will say for the purposes of this, everyone roll an investigation check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Everyone who's going upstairs?","response":"DM: Everyone roll an investigation check. This is investigation."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Natural 20.\nSAM: 28.","response":"DM: Okay. The three of you going upstairs: you find no further traps, you go through the rooms on the top floor. You find that where previously most of them were empty, a lot of them have been furnished now but most of the furnishings have been untouched, like the house was being set up to be almost like a summer home or a side home, but no signs of life; everything seems to have the same layer of dust you found on the floor in the foyer. There is no real wealth being kept here, 'cause I know that's probably what you're looking for. It looks like whoever had intended to, this collector, hadn't quite gotten to the point of wanting to move any of their fortune, their masses, into the upstairs area."}
{"prompt":"SAM: So we go down.","response":"DM: Now what did you roll?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I rolled 14.\nLIAM: Oh, 11.","response":"DM: Grog?"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Oh, 11.","response":"DM: Pike?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 13.\nMARISHA: Are there any further signs like the feast of people leaving in a hurry? That seems like someone was here and left really fast? A suitcase, or–?","response":"DM: From what you can tell, the meal that was prepared, the pots and pans and stuff that were used to cook it are currently in a small basin that carries a little bit of still water that's been slowly evaporating over time with bits of dried food crusted around the sides. The meal itself appears to have been abandoned not in haste, there's no signs of a struggle, the fork is still resting partially in the now mushroom fungus-covered pile. Even getting near it you're  still like (disgusted grunt) but there's no previous sign of a struggle."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: How big was the feast?","response":"DM: It looked like it was just made for one person."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Interesting.\nTRAVIS: Are there any, like, sculptures? Or pieces of art downstairs? Or desks?","response":"DM: Actually, there are a number of rather garish tapestries around. A number of them are of different animals running and hunting and chasing, not in a very beautiful way, but the kind that you'd, you know, find at an airport."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Like the Denver airport?","response":"DM: You know, like Kinkade “Burst of Light.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Wow, you paint a picture there.\nTALIESIN: No historical acts, no mythology, nothing like that?","response":"DM: No, not in this current setup."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I Detect Magic on any of them?","response":"DM: Okay, you scoot through and using– do you have Detect Magic memorized?"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No. I wanted to arcane it.","response":"DM: Then make an arcana check to inspect and see if you see any signs of–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I'm not good at it.\nLIAM: Still mildly hungover.\nMARISHA: Yeah, still really hungover. 14.","response":"DM: 14. Going from place to place, nothing seems to jump out at you as enchanted or any sort of arcane nature. The only room you haven't inspected yet is the hallway across from the foyer, the one that led into the original gallery room and then into the hidden–"}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: The funhouse.\nSAM: Let's all go.\nTRAVIS: Should we check the fucking carpet?\nMARISHA: I say yeah.\nLAURA: Yeah, teleportation circle. Remember there were a shitton of traps before we got to it.","response":"DM: What's up, Pike?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Can I do a religion check to see if there's any Vecna stuff here?\nLAURA: Yeah, smart move.","response":"DM: Yeah, make a religion check."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: 20.","response":"DM: Okay. Looking about and keeping this in mind, you don't see any sort of religious iconography. Any of the artwork, any of the small knickknacks that are throughout the den, nothing here speaks of any sort of religious connotation, or at least whoever has decorated this place did so purely out of visual aesthetic choice. So yeah, nothing catches your attention in this room."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay.\nSAM: Let's go. Who's going first? Pike?\nASHLEY: Sure!\nLIAM: Pike then Grog?\nLAURA: Trinket, then me.\nTALIESIN: Then me.","response":"DM: Then Percy."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Does Pike get a cloak?\nMARISHA: I guess me.\nSAM: Then Vax's wardrobe rack, then me.\nLIAM: No, it's got to go behind, I have to pull it behind.\nASHLEY: Do I get that invisibility cloak again?\nLIAM: No.\nMARISHA: Is that the same one that was here last time?","response":"DM: Yeah. Yeah, same one. There are a number of small cylindrical platforms that rise up in the center of this room. You see on the first sets a series of bronze busts of a particular man wearing a cloth wrap, a headpiece. His features are still nondescript. There's a lot of detail in the clothing, in the neck wrap and the head wrap. But when it comes to the actual features of the face it's very simple and plain."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Not enough to recognize anything.\nLAURA: Kind of like a god of secrets?","response":"DM: No. I'm actually going to ask you guys to roll a history check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: 22.\nTALIESIN: 26.\nLAURA: What is this, history?\nMARISHA: 20.\nLAURA: 21.\nLAURA: Oh! Oh! Wait!\nMARISHA: Yeah.\nLAURA: That's where Riskel was going to go.","response":"DM: It's also where Jarett is from."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Jarett's a mole, kill him.","response":"DM: And you've heard that the city has been lorded over and run in a very benevolent way by an individual referred to as J'mon Sa Ord. The city has existed for about 400 years, and since its existence has been run by J'mon Sa Ord. People don't know if he's human, what he is. But he's apparently lived that long."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How long? I didn't hear because I was writing.","response":"DM: 400 years."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: That doesn't sound good.","response":"DM: That's as much as you can assert. And those thoughts come to you three and you see this bust, these series of busts that seem to depict this individual, and to the best of your knowledge that's probably an artist's depiction of J'mon Sa Ord. Which you've never seen in Tal'Dorei. Or anything of this type of construct."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: But we know that that's where Riskel wanted to go as well. I want to pull out the symbol of Vecna that I took off of Riskel and–","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: I feel like we might've– I feel like that's not also the first time we've heard of Ank'Harel.\nLAURA: Well Jarett's from there.\nMARISHA: I feel like even before then, like a long time ago.\nLIAM: Can I check for traps while they're talking?","response":"DM: Sure, make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Marquet is the continent? Correct?","response":"DM: Correct, yes."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: And Ank'Harel is a city within the continent.\nLIAM: 20.\nMARISHA: It's like a desert continent? The whole continent is like desert?","response":"DM: Desert and mountains."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So it's like Australia?\nMARISHA: Which one?","response":"DM: The right socket."}
{"prompt":"SAM: That's straight-up Goonies. This place has been pilfered before and no one took that.\nTRAVIS: I go over to the dominoes.\nTALIESIN: I'm going to examine the skull.\nMARISHA: I'm going to help Percy examine the skull.","response":"DM: Okay, are you just taking a look at it?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm taking a look at it, I'm checking to see if it's attached to the– it's sitting on a column at the moment?","response":"DM: It's sitting on one of the columns, yeah. It's part of the collection."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I'm seeing if it's attached at all and very gently turning it if I don't see any–","response":"DM: As you reach out take it and its weight and you lift it off the cylindrical pillar–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I was just going to turn it. I wasn't quite going to lift it yet.","response":"DM: As you turn it, it turns freely."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Everyone dies.","response":"DM: Yeah. It's heavier than you expected it would be and–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Oh god, it's going to talk to me, isn't it?","response":"DM: There's a part of you that– like a slight cold chill runs down your spine."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: A recognizable cold chill, or a brand-new cold chill?","response":"DM: No, just like every person has that little part in the back of their head that says, “This probably isn't a good idea, but whatever.”"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I hate you so much!","response":"DM: So, you're holding it in your hand, what do you want to do?"}
{"prompt":"LIAM: You're like a magnet for evil.\nTALIESIN: I'm a little evil magnet, I know. I'm checking, is the emerald set into the socket or is it removable?","response":"DM: It's set in the socket, actually, and the emerald– go ahead and make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I think I've found something evil.\nLAURA: Maybe you should not be touching it.\nMARISHA: Yeah, can I do a nature check to see if I can recognize what kind of skull it might be?","response":"DM: Sure."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 17.","response":"DM: The skull does not come from any beast that you are familiar with, you've not encountered a creature of this physiology, and it definitely doesn't come from the realm of nature from your understanding."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Pike, don't you think you should have a look at it?\nASHLEY: Yeah, can I give it a– what do you see inside the gem?\nTALIESIN: It's like a ripple, almost like a pond that's just gently disturbed. Oh. I have a thought.\nMARISHA: What?\nTALIESIN: This is precisely the sort of awful thing that I would design if I wanted a way to look into a hallway. I'm going to place it back on the column, facing the wall.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Pike, do you want to look at it further?\nASHLEY: Yeah, can I give it a look? I want to look at the tea set too.\nLAURA: I know, I want to go look at the tea set.\nLIAM: Let's look at the evil skull first.\nASHLEY: Can I do a check?","response":"DM: Okay, so what are you trying to check about the skull?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I don't know, like if it's– I don't know. I don't know what to check.\nTRAVIS: If it's evil?\nLAURA: Is that like an arcana check or–?","response":"DM: Well, it depends on what nature you're trying to ascertain of the skull. Are you trying to figure–"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah well I want to check if it's evil, but I don't know. It seems like it is.\nLIAM: I mean, we've been talking about–","response":"DM: There are spells called Detect Good and Evil."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: – some fucknut with one eye. I feel like–\nSAM: Oh, it's Vecna?\nMARISHA: It's the left eye. He said it's in its right eye.\nLAURA: Still, then its left eye is empty.\nASHLEY: I have it, I have it, I have it, I have it! Let me do that.","response":"DM: You have it memorized?"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yep, it's right in here.\nASHLEY: Okay. I think that's okay. I think– that's fine.","response":"DM: Okay. So as the orbs that have been rotating around for the past, you know, it's been about ten minutes, they probably would have faded anyway, gently dissipate, you focus your intent on the skull, and this object, while it is not a desecrated object per se, there is an essence inside that does not strike you as moral. There is something about its very nature that does give you pause. You are unable to ascertain the nature, given the fact that you would have to take some time with it to really do so, but you get the feeling that there is some power within it, but probably not the kind that is very fortuitous for someone of your persuasion."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Okay. I think it's bad.\nTRAVIS: You think it's bad?\nASHLEY: Let's have it face the wall. I don't want it looking at us.\nLAURA: Can I go take the top off the tea set and look inside?","response":"DM: Yeah. You go ahead and take the top off the tea set and look inside; it is empty, it is polished, and the light that comes in as you open the top just refracts the image from the outside of the tea set, and it's just beautiful craftsmanship. The actual gold itself is very smooth on most of the tea kettle, and all the cups themselves all have very very intricate scrolling on them that have been handcarved in; it's a beautiful set. This is like a royal gift. This is something that, you know, people who trade across political boundaries use to, you know, send goodwill to the other side. This is probably worth quite a bit."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Is there any stamping on it to like show who it's from or anything like that?","response":"DM: You look on the bottom and it has the initials L.M."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: L.M. L.M. L.M.\nTRAVIS: Love, Macna.","response":"DM: The street cousin of Vecna."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I would recommend that if we are going to… purloin things, we should do it on the way out rather than the way in.\nLAURA: Oh. Yeah, definitely.","response":"DM: Yeah, some of them are set on the side, there's a stack, and then a few of them are set up– it's literally placed in like a nice presentational like QVC style “turn it and look at all the cool dominoes” type."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I grab the table and I shake it.","response":"DM: Okay. All the dominoes (scattering sound) scatter and fall off the sides, (clatter sounds) and clinking on the ground, some of the ivory chips a little bit on some of the corners."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Grog.","response":"DM: Nothing bad seems to happen."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I think it's evil. I reach down, I pick up one of the ivory die.","response":"DM: It stands there, cold, against the very well, you taste it. As your tongue touches the ivory of the domino, it tastes somewhat salty."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: I believe it tastes like a domino.\nLAURA: Okay, can we go look at the teleportation thingy now?\nSAM and TALIESIN: Let's go down.\nSAM: I'm just going to peek behind the tapestry.\nLIAM: There's a door behind there.","response":"DM: You open up the tapestry and it's just a flat stone wall."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Okay. Nothing there.\nTRAVIS: Are you sure?\nSAM: I lick the wall.","response":"DM: Okay, as you lick the wall your face (wind sound) passes through the wall."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Isn't that the same doorway we found before?\nMARISHA: Yeah, we've already done this once, you guys, let's not be crazy.\nSAM: I forgot about that. Where'd my face go?!\nTALIESIN: It was just like this last time, except there was brunch. That's all I remember.","response":"DM: As your head passes through, you look about and you can see stairs that descend for about 40 feet into darkness."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: So wait, wait. There's the, there's still the tapestry in front of it?","response":"DM: Yeah, there's a tapestry in front of it, yeah."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Can I take the tapestry off? The wall? I want to like take it and put it over my shoulders and jump a little.\nSAM: Like make it a parachute?\nMARISHA: Yeah. See if–\nLAURA: Is it flying?","response":"DM: Okay, as you take the tapestry and you put it around, you grab on the ends of it and you jump in the air, it jumps with you and lands with you. It's a very heavy tapestry. Most tapestries, the amount of craftsmanship that goes into it, the material– this one in particular, it falls very very heavily against the wall and doesn't really gather any air or–"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: In her defense, the last time she tried this, it did fly away. It's not a flying tapestry.\nMARISHA: Yeah. I just thought I'd try.\nLAURA: Maybe just put it over top of that skull and keep it hidden for now.\nMARISHA: Okay, I take the tapestry and I put it over the skull.","response":"DM: Okay. As you throw the tapestry on top of the skull–"}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Oh boy.","response":"DM: Nothing happens."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Such an asshole!\nLIAM: Perception check, perception check, perception check.\nLAURA: Oh god, really?\nLIAM: 20 for me.\nTRAVIS: 19.\nLAURA: One!","response":"DM: Delight. Glancing in the next room, and this is a small chamber you guys have seen before, it's about 30 feet across, on the far end there is a small, circular stone platform about six inches thick that has deep inset runes carved in a circular pattern across it. It's less polished than the ones you've seen at the Lyceum in Emon, but it is definitively the last teleportation circle you took to the cavern that housed General Krieg where you had your encounter."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And the last time we were here, I found a safe path through. Do I remember it?","response":"DM: Correct. You actually distinctly recall the pattern, to the best of your ability."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.","response":"DM: Now I want you to go ahead and make a wisdom check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: You have advantage. No, wait, that's saving throws. Never mind.\nLAURA: Use Luck.\nLIAM: I could use Luck, yeah. 20.","response":"DM: 20. Yeah, you recall the exact pattern through. Leading the way, stepping from stone to stone to stone, you guys following his pattern, you manage to make your way, all of you, including Trinket who has to (bear grunts)."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: He remembers.","response":"DM: Guide you through. You make your way all the way across the room to the teleportation circle, and this is the end of this portion of the hallway. What do you wish to do?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: Do we step onto it? How does it work?\nLAURA: I don't remember.\nTRAVIS: I think we just run ahead.\nLAURA: Wait, does it look like there's been anybody in here since we left?","response":"DM: Go ahead and make a survival check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Survival?\nLIAM: Jeepers.\nLAURA: What in the (popping sound)?! That's my third one of the night.\nTRAVIS: Can I do that one too? I can survival stuff pretty well.\nMARISHA: Can I assist Grog in finding if our footsteps were the last ones out?","response":"DM: True, I was giving this more as a means of giving the trained tracker a better look into this. I'll give you a simple perception check as you're not quite sure."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That'll be way worse.\nLIAM: Worse than a natural one?","response":"DM: But with Keyleth's help that will give you advantage."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: 11.","response":"DM: It's hard to tell. This room itself is pretty dark, the little sconces that hold this low flicker of eternal arcane light, they're just gently flickering on the sides of the walls, in the low light it's hard to make out any details of the ground and for the most part the stonework here seems unchanged."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We suck.\nTALIESIN: Are we going onto the teleportation pad then?\nLIAM: But I think we assume we're walking into trouble.\nSAM: Trouble is our middles names.\nMARISHA: Well, let's think of what happened last time we were here.\nSAM: There was a dragon, there was some loot.\nTRAVIS: There was a bunch of gold.\nMARISHA: There was a bunch of gold and there were three eyes in a wall–\nLAURA and MARISHA: Saying they were coming for us.\nSAM: Did we crack one of them?\nMARISHA: We did crack one of them. One cracked.\nLAURA: They all cracked.\nMARISHA: But, wait weren't the–\nSAM: Maybe they've reformed.","response":"DM: There were four orbs and then one eye showed up in one of the orbs and then all four cracked."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: Can't we send like a probe, can't you make a little person? A little fake little person?\nSAM: I can make a fake person to push something or lift something, but he won't be able to–\nTRAVIS: He can't take a magic ride?\nMARISHA: These aren't the same gems that were holding Uriel's family, those were different.\nLAURA: No. These were dragoneye things.\nLIAM: These were palantirs hanging in a wall where another dragon somewhere peeked through and was pissed off.\nLAURA: Let's do it! Let's go through! Pow!","response":"DM: Okay. As each one of you step on individually onto the platform, there's a brief moment of the wind beneath your stomach being lifted and you feel those butterflies hit as suddenly your imagery shifts and immediately you find yourself standing on a similar platform elsewhere. As you step off, as you feel force pushing you forward, as each individual starts appearing behind in rapid succession, immediately you notice the air change to extremely cold."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That's right, it was in the mountain cave.","response":"DM: Looking around you can see there, directly near you, there are a few stalagmites with a little layer of snow and ice on it and there are a couple patches of ice that have solidified on parts of the floor. Across the way you can see immediately a large portion of the entire tunnel has collapsed. There's just piles of just rocks and stones that have filled about 60 to 65% of what was previously General Krieg, or as you found the name to be, Bonescythe– Brimscythe, sorry.  Brimscythe's chambers. All the rocks have crumbled onto where the dragon hoard that you were rage-looting before, currently resided now just held beneath the boulders and rocks."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Get rid of those rocks?\nMARISHA: I might be able to.","response":"DM: There are pockets of the cave that are walkable. To the left it ends to where the boulders and rubble had fallen, to the right it continues outward towards the outside of the mountain where you guys recall stepping to the edge of the precipice, and you notice that this mountain was very,very high up in the mountain range somewhere in the world where there was just ice and snow-capped mountains as far as you could see into this valley of high crags."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Well if I recall, it wasn't too far from Stillben right? Because Keyleth recognized it as her home mountains? Like two hours?","response":"DM: You recognize it as the Cliffkeep, which is the large mountain range to the north of Tal'Dorei which contains Kraghammer, the very south base contains Gatshadow, and it's where the Umbra Hills leads up into– You don't know where in that range, it's a huge mountain range, but it's in that range."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Is there any sign of the pile of gold that Grog started rage-looting?","response":"DM: Make a perception check. (sings) Make a perception check."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Everybody?","response":"DM: Everybody who wants to look around."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: 23.\nTRAVIS: 18. Oh mine is– Oh, 18.\nLAURA: 17.\nSAM: 20.","response":"DM: Percy. Keyleth."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Nine.\nMARISHA: Natural 20.\nMARISHA: Can I do a nature check?\nTRAVIS: Umber hulks?\nMARISHA: Yeah, don't those fuckers do that type of shit? 20 total.","response":"DM: 20? Okay. The way these tunnels are created, and you've seen umber hulks and things of that nature carved through, there is a rough aspect to that digging and burrowing process where the earth itself has an uneven, you know, a general purposed direction, but is in itself a very haphazard just grab and tear what's in your way type form of burrowing. These are round and smooth."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: No scratch marks, claw marks? Almost seems mechanical type of– magical?\nTALIESIN: I'll assist in that perception check.","response":"DM: Okay, you guys can do that."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: And none of us remember them from our past visit?","response":"DM: No. In fact, one of them is burrowing through the actual rubble on the north side by where the hoard was buried."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: (gasps) No!\nMARISHA: How can you tell?\nTALIESIN: Because it's the flat. 13.","response":"DM: Okay. As you step up and look about the rubble, the best you can make out is parts of the rock, and you know, the rock here has been set since the collapse of this side of the tunnel, there are a series of scratch marks across the set stones and rocks here. Meaning that something large has rummaged through the rubble here. Something with bladed or clawed appendages has been here and has very viciously or hurriedly attempted to find its way through the rubble. You also notice there is, to the immediate left and northwestern side of this cavern, a small alcove that just disappears into the wall out of sight."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: That wasn't there before? Or was that one there before?","response":"DM: No, that was there before, yeah."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Does it seem like this could have been made by a dragon? These scratch marks?","response":"DM: You and dragons–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Favored enemy.","response":"DM: Yeah, as your favored enemy, make a–"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I'm scared of all of my d20s right now.\nMARISHA: Roll good.","response":"DM: Make a nature check."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: A nature check?","response":"DM: With advantage because it's a dragon. Dragons are magical entities. This would be more arcana."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Plus two on dragon checks. Arcana?!","response":"DM: They're magical entities. I'll give you either/or. What did you get?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I rolled a 16, but I get plus two on any investigation for dragon info stuff.","response":"DM: Okay. These marks across could very easily have come from a dragon, a very large one. You also notice that there are elements of the rocks amongst this rubble, that there appears to be soot and singe marks across it."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Are dragons known for digging, or are there certain types of dragons that are known for digging?","response":"DM: There are a couple that can burrow and dig through rock and stone. In particular, the blue dragon, the one that you guys defeated in here, can burrow naturally, as can the white dragons. They're natural burrowers, though not the most intelligent of the chromatic dragons. You also know that some of the metallic dragons also, like the brass dragon is a burrower."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Would they be capable of making the smooth tunnels?","response":"DM: Not that smooth. Those come from something else. You inspecting the alcove?"}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: As you look inside the alcove, immediately you see in the shadow and what little bit of light is coming from the outside part of the tunnel, and it is pretty obscured here. I would recommend putting a torch up if you have one."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Yeah.","response":"DM: Okay, you spark up a torch. You inspect the inside of this alcove and immediately you see the reflection of the light across the surface of something. Something humanoid standing there in wait."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: Whoa! And I back up and draw.","response":"DM: You draw your weapon and aim it. What you can see, as you take a moment, is an older man, wrinkled in face, eyes open, mouth agape in fear, his arms out before him, back to the wall on the inside. Frozen solid."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: I found something! I'm inspecting him as best I can, frozen solid.\nTRAVIS: Did you do that?\nTALIESIN: No! No, I found this.","response":"DM: Investigation check."}
{"prompt":"TRAVIS: That's cold-blooded.\nTALIESIN: 14. That's a terrible pun.","response":"DM: It's hard to tell what may have frozen him. The temperature here is very cold. He may have just frozen to death, but his face, his expression leads you to believe that this was more a moment of duress. More immediate than a slow, subtle, over time."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: What is he wearing?","response":"DM: His clothing is very, very well-made. There is embroidery across the sleeves and the base of these robes. He appears to have jewelry on him. He has not quite a Fu Manchu, but a mustache that extends beyond here. The hair is braided and goes to his lower back. He is human, hunched, and that's about the most you can make out at this visual state."}
{"prompt":"SAM: Does it look like he might be my son?","response":"DM: The resemblance is uncanny. No. On top of being purely human and no one you've ever recognized, no."}
{"prompt":"SAM: I suspect everyone now.\nLAURA: I wonder if he's the owner of the house.","response":"DM: The northern tunnel, the smooth tunnel as you bring your torch over, whoever's inspecting the north one."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Sure, why not?","response":"DM: You don't have to, but as you guys look up, having low-light vision helps in this circumstance, as well. You can see a little bit of a glistening. As you peer into the smooth tunnel ahead of you, you can see that where the rock was burrowed through, a portion of it has opened up a pocket, and there's a small fountain of gold spilling into the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"SAM: A fountain of gold?","response":"DM: Not like a perpetual– it looks like whatever tore through here, gold pieces that were buried as part of the collapsing tunnel were exposed and spilled into the tunnel."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Bag of Holding!\nTRAVIS: What, I have it.\nSAM: It's a Scrooge Dragon.\nTRAVIS: I go over and put it under the gold. I open up the Bag of Holding.\nSAM: Wait. Why are we here? Why have we come here?\nMARISHA: Yeah, and remember last time we did this?\nSAM: Are we just getting as much money as we can and leave, or are we trying to kill something, or are we trying to seal this place off? Why are we here?\nMARISHA: I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm with Scanlan.\nTRAVIS: There's gold!\nLAURA: We should definitely take that frozen man.\nSAM: So is our mission to take money and leave?\nTALIESIN: No. There's a frozen man. We actually have a mystery. We have to deal with this.\nLAURA: Wait, Ashley. I can't hear her. What did she say?\nASHLEY: The frozen man is obviously dead.","response":"DM: The frozen man is very dead."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Oh, he is? He's dead dead?\nTALIESIN: He's dead dead. He might be the owner of the house.\nASHLEY: Did I freeze?\nLIAM: Pike, you're frozen.\nSAM: But we can still hear you, so keep talking.\nMARISHA: Because they said he was an older art collector, gray-haired man, right?","response":"DM: What elements of the individual that you've heard about does match some of the description of this individual."}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: I'm sorry. I would like to see if I could cast Speak With Dead and ask some questions.","response":"DM: Okay."}
{"prompt":"SAM: We might have to unfreeze him first.\nLAURA: Maybe not.\nMARISHA: I can maybe do that.\nTALIESIN: Torch-heating the face.\nMARISHA: I'll light up my fire hands and start melting, just his face.\nASHLEY: Melting around his mouth.","response":"DM: The spell does require the corpse to be able to speak, so you would have to thaw him."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Thawing.","response":"DM: Okay. It's going to take you a little bit, but using your simple druidic powers. You're using cantrips, essentially. Or your fire hands. Yeah, so it'll take you a little while, but you begin to thaw the corpse. What's everyone else doing?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We're trying to get the gold out from the wall.\nTRAVIS: We're not yet.\nLAURA: I'm trying to get the gold out from the wall.\nSAM: If you're going, I'm going with you to protect you because god knows Trinket won't.\nTALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye on the south.\nMARISHA: I can Move Earth and we can move around earth.\nLIAM: Out of curiosity, I'm going to carefully make my way towards the mouth of the cave and see if there's anything problematic out there. Perception check the whole way.","response":"DM: You guys step along. You go with Vex into the tunnel. You're watching the south area as they pass you, and you're currently thawing. Is Trinket coming with you guys, or is Trinket staying with you in the tunnel?"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: He's going to be with us in the tunnel.","response":"DM: Okay, cool. And you're with?"}
{"prompt":"SAM: I'm with Vex and Trink.","response":"DM: You start scooping the gold, and you can see now, some of this appears to have been taken. Someone has been through here and it looks like there has been some attempts at looting this area. It looks like someone has already pulled in here, and there's an empty pocket there, but you start pulling gold out and scooping it into the Bag of Holding. As you guys are walking away, you feel this lurch in the floor."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I stop.\nSAM: Wait, that's not us.\nLAURA: Can we feel it?\nMARISHA: Can everyone feel it?","response":"DM: All you guys begin to feel this vibration in the ground."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Okay, maybe we should stop.\nSAM: Faster, faster!\nLAURA: Just pause for a second!","response":"DM: It gets louder and more violent. You see the coins on the ground beginning to rattle and move."}
{"prompt":"LIAM: Perception roll to tell if it's an earthquake?\nSAM: I think because we touched this gold–\nMARISHA: Nature check?","response":"DM: Make a nature check."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: 19.","response":"DM: It feels like an earthquake."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: (shouting) Earthquake! Get to the archways! (quieter) Find a bathroom.","response":"DM: As the shouting has happened, towards the center of the room, the ground explodes. There is a blast of shrapnel shale that bursts in the vicinity. No one is immediately there, so none of you are harshly impacted, but you see erupting from the ground a large form begin to burst out of the ground."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: I hide.\nSAM: Pike! Ask the dead guy who it is.\nMARISHA: Because Pike and I are by the dead guy, right? I take Pike and back her behind the dead guy, and we're hiding.","response":"DM: Okay. You guys see this form now in the low light emerge. Ten, 15, 20, 25 feet up, this long, cylindrical mass curves up and begins to shift. As it does, like a giant arm, it twists around and stares at the room, and what you see before you is this elongated wormlike structure where a giant mouth opens up with rows and rows of sharp teeth on the interior of its toothy maw. Deal with it! It's the perfect circumstance for the term. As you see strands of saliva pull apart and you see a very hint of color beneath the dark surface, a deep purple tone to its thick segmented hide."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: We've fought one of these before, right?","response":"DM: No, you have not."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: We have not? I hide. I hide in my cloak.\nTALIESIN: That's a big bag you've got there.\n(groaning)","response":"DM: And that's where we're going to leave tonight's session."}
{"prompt":"(yelling)\nLAURA: Oh no!","response":"DM: So next week, we're going to pick up with that chaos."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: Ash, you have to be here next week, too!\nSAM: What the fuck is a purple worm?\nLIAM: Put that thing away. Put it back in the bag.\nASHLEY: I don't think I'm working next Thursday.\nTALIESIN and MARISHA: Yay!\nALL: Fly home!","response":"DM: We'll all pitch in. I'm kind of serious."}
{"prompt":"MARISHA: Don't! Don't do it. They're too nice.","response":"DM: Don't do that. We'll pick up at the start of this encounter next Thursday. Things with tremorsense are fun."}
{"prompt":"LAURA: How much gold did we get, though, before it cocked up?","response":"DM: You'll find out. You haven't had a chance to count."}
{"prompt":"TALIESIN: We'll finish looting that once we've cut this thing up into little pieces of sushi.\nMARISHA: Man, Matt knows us really well. We walk into every fucking everything.\nLAURA: You know, sometimes you just have to.\nTALIESIN: We don't walk away.","response":"DM: That's what adventure is!"}
{"prompt":"LAURA: You've got to.\nTALIESIN: It's a series of bad decisions.","response":"DM: You really don't have to, but it was an option."}
